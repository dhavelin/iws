				<div class="content">Is this the poitin or the tubes?<br /><br />I met John Cashman the other day. He said that they were surprised by just how popular the poitin is proving and might have to consider releasing more than originally anticipated. I hope I'm representing what he said correctly. <br /><br />He said something about the Kilbeggan single pot still too, but I can't quire remember what.</div>
