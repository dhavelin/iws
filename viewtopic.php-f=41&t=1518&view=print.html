				<div class="content">Hi Guys,<br /><br />I was doing a bit of spring cleaning and find that I have 6 ... yes 6 bottles of Jameson 18yo.<br /><br />I had pretty much forgotten about the lot of them except the couple I have earmarked for drinking.<br /><br />Anyway if there are any completists out there I have the first 4 Jameson 18yo versions released. So these ones are in the tubes not like the current boxes.<br /><br />JJ18-1 (This being the very first Jameson 18yo released)<br />JJ18-2<br />JJ18-3<br />JJ18-4<br /><br />If anybody is interested drop me a PM and we can discuss.</div>

				<div class="content">Not 100% sure G-W-H but initially it was a batch release thing and we have been told that tey release only a limited amount once a year.<br /><br />The first 4 were from the following years<br /><br />JJ18-1 (2002) Old Style Canister <br />JJ18-2 (2003)<br />JJ18-3 (2004)<br />JJ18-4 (2005)<br /><br />Not sure if there was a JJ18-5 or 6 as I have never come across one but if anyone can confirm their existance it would be great. I suspect though if there is one released in 2006 one of the codes was dropped to even up the code with the year either from 2006 or 2007.<br />JJ18-5 (2006) or JJ18-6 (2006) but I reckon not both<br /><br />JJ18-7 (2007)<br /><br />JJ18-8 (2008) New Packaging Square card box first introduced in 2008<br /><br />Lastly I think this coding has been dropped and is now just a static code for every year since. <br />I have not seen any further evidence of these codes since JJ18-8 and I have a JJ18-8 with the bottle code of L0 and a date of 26/03/10.<br /><br />Again if anybody has evidence in regards to L9(2009), L1(2011) &amp; L2(2012) just to confirm it would be great to hear. Check the for such codes and cross reference to the actual bottle code of JJ18-8.<br /><br />Edit: Just to add not sure when it went from <span style="font-weight: bold">Master Selection</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold">Limited Reserve</span> but should be an easy one to figure out.</div>

				<div class="content">Just so I am completely clear on this...is the Jameson 18 'Master Selection' (available in Ontario, and something I sampled...and loved!!...just last weekend) the same bottling (and recipe) as the Jameson 18 'Limited Reserve' (listed on the Celtic Whiskey Shop website)?  If I understand, it IS the same bottling with simply a change in the name of the bottle, which occured at some point in the last several years.  <br /><br />Thank you for the clarification, and any additional information that you can add for me about this bottle (i.e. why the name change?)  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Pretty much the same thing ... However the 18yo is made/bottled in small batches with one batch being created every year. There can be differences between the batches but it is pretty much the same style of whiskey that they try to create every time. A bit like Midleton VR.<br /><br />The positive side is that it had mainly improved on previous batches. Further I don't thing they are using a batch marking system any more. They may have removed the jj18 code altogether now but it stayed at jj18-8 for a long while even for different batches.</div>
