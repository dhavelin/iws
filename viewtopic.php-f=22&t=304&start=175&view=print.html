Which just goes to show that we, or at least I should never discount blends. Of course I haven't been near the 21 or the Millenium tonight. <br /><br />Anyway, I think I need to go to bed - some crazy Hungarian had me out drinking in Dublin till all hours last night and I'm wrecked. Now anyone care to guess who that was!!!!</div>

				<div class="content">Tried the 2 of them together recently - I think I agree.<br /><br />Nothing too exciting so far tonight - decided to try a few Bushmills so had the 10yo as a base line. Nothing to set the world alight but a very pleasant easy drinker. And one of the whiskeys that started me off on this 6 or 7 years ago - at the time I was drinking this and a 12yo Jamseon with the brother in law - first time I had two whiskeys head to head to compare.<br /><br />Anyway just moved onto the 12yo Select Casks - a very unusual Bushmills but one I'd forgotten how much I liked. A lot more going on than the 10. <br /><br />Also munching my way through a big plate of spanish ham - I feel I should really be drinking a chilled dry sherry! But no, the whiskey works just fine!</div>
