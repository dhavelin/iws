				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />My grandfather has 3 bottles of Midleton very rare 1986 that he has asked me to sell for him. They are in original boxes, with cert (which has not been filled in or sent away). I have photos that i can upload, was wondering if any of you would be interested. Please post here, or contact me on 0871144811 should you have any further questions.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">having received valuable feedback from users (thank you) regarding these bottles, I was hoping that somebody may finally be able to direct me towards the best place to sell them (as I now understand that you are not allowed to sell them here).

All such talk needs to be done off line ... Hopefully that helps.<br /><br />Where are you based?<br /><br />If in Ireland contact the Celtic Whiskey Shop with one and if in the UK contact The Whisky Exchange in London. They may make cash offers. Also good to know what the offers are for any further offers from other areas.</div>
