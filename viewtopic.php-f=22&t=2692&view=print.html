				<div class="content">Does anybody knows about flaviar.com? <br /><br />I'm new whiskey aficionado and I would like to know if price is worth or this is for serious drinkers. Only thing I know: there is a waiting list where you have to register your interest and a membership subscription by month (31 euro according to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dramming.com/2013/12/04/a-look-at-flaviar">http://www.dramming.com/2013/12/04/a-look-at-flaviar</a><!-- m -->) that gives you access to their offers and up to 1 free shipping per month.<br /><br />Would you pay a subscription like this or do you find in eBay a better friend?<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

				<div class="content">They have some good prices but the waiting can be annoying. <br /><br />Ebay won't sell alcohol in Ireland or the UK now so that option is off track books for a while for me. <br /><br />Where are you living?</div>

				<div class="content">I live in Dublin. I use to compare offers from Tesco, Supervalu and O'Briens for a better price and some times I ask friends and family to buy me spirits from duty-frees. From time to time, I order online too. There was an online wine seller I used to buy from that no longer operates in the UK&amp;Ireland called <a href="http://www.bernabei.co.uk/" class="postlink">Bernabei</a> and I also follow Masters of Malt, but I havent bought from them yet.<br /><br />Do you guys have any favorites?</div>

				<div class="content">I mostly buy my whiskey on supermarkets offers as my finances are very limited. but for sure I wont order anything from flaviar again as it took them 5 weeks (!) and million emails to inform me that my parcel will be shipped LATER(!) because they sold me a bottle they dont have on stock.</div>
