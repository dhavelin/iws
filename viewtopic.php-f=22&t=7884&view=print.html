Can someone explain the price difference?  I've tried the Midleton at a spirits festival and liked it but the price is too high for me.  Is the Jameson a better alternative (I've not had it),or would I be better looking elsewhere in the IDL range?  Thanks for your help.</div>

The Cask Strength or 15 are great whiskeys if you can get them.<br /><br /> The Midleton at that price is shocking. I think the 18 at $125 Canadian is much better value. It's one of the best blended whiskeys you'll try.</div>

Although I'm surprised at the price difference over in canada as they are actually quite similar prices here. €155 (VR) as to €125 (J18). It is possible that this is a special price on the 18year old as they may be phasing it out so definately pick one up <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />But, Yes the 18 would be a really nice one to go for also and the price point is actually very good. The 18 just like the Midleton VR is quite refined and very drinkable. However it has a more Jameson character which is slightly different to the Midleton VR. <br /><br />If you are still a bit unsure you could even start with the 12yo or the Jameson Select / Black Barrel (Not sure what it is called these days) just to get a feel for the Jameson range. Jameson Gold is another one to look at also.<br /><br />Others to Consider are Redbreast 15yo &amp; 12yo and a really excellent one in my books at a very reasonable in price point is the Writers Tears if you can see it.<br /><br />In all fairness I think you would be pleased with any variation you pick.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the helpful responses.  I should explain that I tasted the Midleton VR and Redbreast 12 at a spirits festival and really enjoyed both.  I bought the Redbreast 12 but price deterred me from buying the Midleton.  My brother in western Canada has picked up bottles of Redbreast 12 CS and 21 for me but I won't get my hands on them until I visit him later this spring.  I have an open bottle of Jameson 12 which I enjoy and also bottles of Black Barrel and Jameson Gold.  Reading between the lines, GWH, I gather that you think the quality of Jameson 18 is not far off the Midleton VR, even if stylistically it is more sherried.  Redbreast 15 is hard to find in Canada but from looking at this site further it's not all that well thought of apart from the 2005 version.  Should I be trying to track down a current bottling of the 15 or something like Powers John's Lane instead?  So many questions....</div>

And John's Lane is for me a desert-island whiskey, especially for the price.</div>
