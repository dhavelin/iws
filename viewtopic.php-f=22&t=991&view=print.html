				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   I discovered the pleasures of drinking Irish Whiskey about nine months ago.  I joined IWS in May 2010.  Since that time, I have consumed the following Brands Irish Whiskies : Redbreast, Black Bush, Jameson 12, The Irishman, Powers, Kilbeggan, Kellan and original Bush.  I have consumed a total of approx. twenty bottles in seven/eight months (perhaps a bit too much) I dunno ?  At any rate, I just wanted to say that I have enjoyed EACH and EVERY ONE of these Irish Whiskies from the lowest priced (in Maine) budget Whiskey &quot;Kilbeggan&quot; to my most expensive Irish Whiskey &quot;Redbreast&quot;.  Yep, I have come to the conclusion that I enjoy them all!  I now keep six/seven bottles bottles open at a time.  Of the brands I have tried, do I have a favorite ?  Well, I find there are some that I enjoy more so than some of the others but, it would be difficult for me to pick THE one.  I am just happy that I can find something POSITIVE to enjoy about each and every one of my collection of wonderful Irish Whiskey!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats! aka Tom Patrick</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Dave,<br /><br />    Yes sir !  All in all, I'm a happy Camper!  Thank you Dave for your kind words regarding the upcoming year.  I hope to explore and perhaps find some new (to me) Irish Whiskey in 2011.  Oooh, if I could afford to purchase a bottle (or two) shipped over from Ireland, might you have any suggestions ?  I was thinking perhaps &quot;Writes Tears&quot;, Locks Grand Crew, Green Spot ?  I am open to suggestions.  Merry Christmas all.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Tom Patrick aka SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">They are all good. You should be able to find Writers Tears in the US, I think. It's one of the best value Irish whiskeys in my opinion.<br /><br />Locke's 8yo is also very good, and reasonable value. Locke's Grand Crew is a bit more expensive but one of the best whiskeys I've ever tried.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Dave,<br /><br />   Thank you for your suggestions.  I am going to put &quot;Locks Grand Crew&quot; at the top of my (to Import) list!  I'll have to search to see if &quot;Writers Tears&quot; is available in the U.S.  Moth, I don't have a liquor Cabinet per se.  What I have is five/six opened bottles of Irish Whiskey that sit atop my vintage (circa mid 1950's) Charles Eames (famous American designer) Stephens Tru-Sonic (E-3 style) Horn Speaker made in Culver City, California.  This (me thinks custom) Tru-Sonic measures 36&quot;H x 36&quot;W x 18&quot;D and weights 175 lbs.  The Tru-Sonic is a very efficient with it's 15&quot; Woofer, ten cell Mid-range horn and eight cell Tweeter horn.  I use a lil' vintage PILOT AA-903B (EL-84) Mono tube Amp that produces perhaps 14 watts and is capable of making the Tru-Sonic MUCH louder that I ever care to listen.  I mostly listen to &quot;Classic Jazz&quot; and &quot;light Classical&quot;.  The Tru-Sonic is not only a beautiful work of Art and sound, but a beautiful item to display my Irish Whiskey Collection.  Sorry for rambling, I guess you can tell I love this set up.  I am a lucky man indeed.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Tom Patrick aka SixCats!</div>
