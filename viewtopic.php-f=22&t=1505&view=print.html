Kilbeggan is the Town where the distillery is situated and Locke's is the name under which it is run ... as it was pre closure in the 50's. Back then the trading name for the whiskey sold would have been Locke's. Today Kilbeggan &amp; Locke's are both used as brand names. However the Kilbeggan brand is much bigger so more emphasis is put on Kilbeggan.<br /><br />The regular Kilbeggan blend is all produced in Riverstown and matured in Kilbeggan. As is the 18yo and the Locke's blends.<br /><br />Then when they started to re-distil in Kilbeggan you are correct in saying that they brought down  low wines from Riverstown for the last distillation. That is why the the Kilbeggan distillery only bottle offering is called <span style="font-style: italic">Kilbeggan Distillery Reserve Malt Whiskey</span> &amp; not <span style="font-style: italic">Kilbeggan Distillery Reserve <span style="font-weight: bold">Single</span> Malt Whiskey</span>.<br /><br />However the situation has changed again and they have up graded Kilbeggan to be totally self sufficient as a distillery and are now distilling Single Malt and Pot Still whiskey using a double distillation method. They have a mill, masher 4 wash backs all installed at this stage. The scale is quite small though and would probably be considered boutique and will possibly be more of a small batch operation. I would imagine that Kilbeggan the blend will continue to be made in Riverstown.<br /><br /><br /><br />However I think</div>

But I recall someone at Cooley saying they hoped that every bottle with the Kilbeggan label would eventually have a component made in Kilbeggan.</div>

I assumed on my blog that it would be a 5-year old version of the previous one but thinking it over it could easily be a 3-year old version that has been entirely distilled in Kilbeggan.</div>

And I'm afraid it was not the greatest whiskey to start off with. Too young and certainly needed more maturation in my opinion. However it was a nice idea to get their Distillery Reserve going.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes it would be sad to see all the innovation being canned, just to concentrate on a few main brands.<br /><br />Finger's crossed that they can see that Cooley as a company got alot of it's recognition from their single cask bottlings and stuff like the Greenore which transferred itself across to main brands.<br /><br />Also I feel they need to re-align their pricing structure.<br /><br />Connemara 12yo has come down some what but it still is too expensive for what may be considered a run of the mill age statement in Scotland. Obviously they need to get their stocks up but low stocks is not a justifiable case for excessive pricing and should be obvious on the low sales of same.</div>

It is a brass mesh chain that would have been rotated around the bottom of the still.  This was done to stop burning of the solids from the wash to the stills.  If the solids in the wash burn they produce a harsh taste and smell.  All direct fired still that I have seen (and there are not may still in use) have this apparatus.  <br /><br />In fact if you look at the Tullamore stills in Kilbeggan you can see where a whole for the rummager at the top of the wash still lines up nicely with a whole in the distillery wall. This is were a drive shaft would have connected the water wheel to the rummager.<br /><br />So that is the end of today's lesson on rummager's!     <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Optics only I believe; I'd prefer to see a more substantive announcement.
