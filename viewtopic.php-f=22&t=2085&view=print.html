				<div class="content">Yes, it uses malt in its Paddy blend, as well as in Tullamore DEW. It used to use it Hewitt's too. <br /><br />They make a batch of malt every now and then. They also have a deal with their old partners Bushmills...</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your help JohnM<br />I was under impression that Midleton is only doing single pot and single grain whiskey [except one time Erin go Bragh], and than I came across information that there is malt whiskey in paddy.<br />Wasn't sure about quality of source so I've decided to ask here <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />Few months ago I had a pleasure of participating in tasting made by John Quinn who is tullamore's global brand ambasador and I remember him saying that they are getting their malt whiskey <br />from bushmills and single pot and grain whiskey from midleton.Would that be true?</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think that there is any reason why IDL could not make a single malt.  But my general understanding is that the malt they use for blending into products comes from OBD.<br /><br />That said crazier things have happened in the world of Irish Whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">As far as I know this is true. I know that Midleton have the equipment to produce malt but they have an arrangement with Bushmills for malt as does Bushmills have an agreement with Midleton to supply them with grain. <br /><br />I have an old bottle of Murphy's Irish Whiskey. This was malt/grain mix. Murphy's were the original owners of Midleton but when it came to a producing a whiskey which bears their name it couldn't be farther than a Midleton style whiskey. <br /> <br />Midleton is noted for Pot Still style and Bushmills for Malt so when they split as a company they just decided to continue the status quo. <br /><br />I'd love to see Midleton make a Malt and see Bushmills make a pot still. Whatever about the former happening I don't think the latter will as long as Diageo are pulling the strings.</div>
