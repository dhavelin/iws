				<div class="content">I had a thread a few months back about buying whiskeys to keep and I did  bit of research and decided to buy a few bottles.<br /><br />Was just looking through them and was wondering what peoples opinions were on my purchases. Did my own research so I know if it wont sell then at least I will enjoy drinking them.<br /><br />Id be interested to know peoples thoughts on whether people would be interested in the bottles and if they do already a better than cost value of if they reckon they will increase. (You can ignore the Jameson 12 year for this as I know its still available in shops)<br /><br />The bottles I got are:<br /><br />Celtic Cask ócht<br />Powers Aviation<br />Redbreast Mano a Lamh<br />Jameson 12 Year Old<br /><br />Thanks in Advance  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">All great collectable whiskeys. The Jameson 12 will become a collectors item in years to come. They're phasing out the 12 &amp; others in time. <br /><br />They're all very drinkable ones too. I've tried a few Mano A Lámh and look forward to trying a Powers Aviation as soon as I can.</div>

Cheers Good Whiskey Hunting.<br /><br />PS all are for sale ha</div></blockquote><br /><br />Hi Barry, as GWH said all these a very nice whiskeys in their own right and will become collectible but probably not for some years to come. <br /><br />You might make 10 or 20 extra on say Celtic Cask ócht &amp; Redbreast Mano a Lamh if you are lucky for find an eager buyer but if I were you I'd hang on to them for another few years.<br /><br />The Powers Aviation is also still available in travel retail so no premium yet but another good one to hold on to.<br /><br />However the 12 is still widely available and will not command a premium for a good few years after it goes out of circulation which is has not yet.<br /><br />Open it and enjoy it and get yourself another down the line  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
