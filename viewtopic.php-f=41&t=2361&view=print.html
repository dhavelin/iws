				<div class="content">having just recently joined your forum I would like to offer for sale my complete collection of Midleton Very Rare which I started in 1984 to date . All bottles are in there original perfect packaging complete with distillery invitation and unopened. I also have some other interesting bottles like the last of the original Jameson 15 Y.O. and Bottles of Redbrest (bottled by Gilbeys with Jameson supplied by IDL). I also have some Mulligan long since discontinued.    Any Interest........................</div>

				<div class="content">Hi mvr,<br /><br />Where do you reside?<br /><br />I would doubt that you would have many on this forum looking for such a set as this is a collectors forum rather than retail purchasers therefore people would rather collect a set themselves by hunting down the individual years.<br /><br />I would suggest that your best bet woulbd be if you are located in Ireland is to contact the Celtic Whiskey shop. <br />2 sets of these were sold lately for very good money. Unfortunately that may mean that the market is closed to such sets as they do command a serious outlay.<br />However I'm sure Ally may put you on his contacts list for such a sale that may arrise and if you can wait you'll be on speed dial if he does come across a customer for a full set.<br /><br />What ever you do (and I presume you know this already) do not split the set up as it is worth substantially more as a set than in individual bottles.<br /><br />For the other bottles you may get a few replies from here but try and list all you individual bottles in as much detail as possible and pictures would even be better.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Best of luck</div>
