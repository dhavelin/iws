				<div class="content">I seen a member of the &quot;Pure Pot Still Irish Whiskey Appreciation Club&quot; posted a picture of this whiskey. <br /><br />It's a 3 Year Old Pure Pot Still according to the label. The company is based in Connecticut. They have Product of Ireland on the label so they must be the real deal. I've never seen a Pot Still so young in the market. I'm guessing it's IDL as they are the only ones with stock that age, but it could be from Kilbeggan as they were laying down some Pot Still a while back and so may be 3 years old by now, I'm not sure. <br /><br />Any info much appreciated. <br /><a href="http://www.chloroman.com/drink/13291001000092" class="postlink">Here's</a> a link to the Label for reference.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Willie,<br />Good find. The Country of Origin statement (Panama) is intriguing!<br />More importantly however, I thought that the re-naming of the PPS to SPS was due in large part to the fact that the US had an issue with the word 'Pure' in the product name? This would suggest otherwise?</div>

				<div class="content">I've been doing a bit more digging and found <a href="http://www.chloroman.com/drink/10158001000047" class="postlink">Wolfhound</a> whiskey. It's registered to a company which is also registered to the same address as the import company for Molloyes. There's 62 other companies registered to that address. Lots share the same owner from my investigation.<br /><br />This has an Irish company mentioned on the label although the webpage isn't active as yet.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Willie,<br /><br />Yes a strange one ... surely not Midleton though ... I would not have thought they would let a 3yo of their whiskey to be released.<br /><br />The mountain water initially suggested Coolety but the Triple distilled probably knocks that on the head !!!!<br /><br />Is this currently released or is it just a label mock up waiting to be released. <br /><br />Could they be waiting for their Dingle or Altec barrels to come of age ????<br /><br />How far off are they to reaching 3 years, I believe it will be the end of this year for both.</div>

				<div class="content">It's already available. I seen it on facebook. I don't know anymore than that. <br /><br />Both Alltech and Dingles 3 years are up in November. I can't see it being them anyway.</div>
