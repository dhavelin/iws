				<div class="content">In a castle near Peebles, I once saw Gorilla hands with the palms inlaid with silver so they could be used as ashtrays.<br />In my opinion, Gorilla-hand ashtrays are a must for the smoking patio.<br />Considering the history of the SMWS might be enlightening in this regard. How long did it take them to go from 10 guys buying a cask to a society owning its own premises?<br />In short, it might not be as far off nor as difficult as we think.<br />I feel that the premises would likely have to be Dublin based, have a display and educational facility, a tasting room, and a licence for retail of alcohol.<br />And gorilla hand ashtrays. Other than that, I'm easy.</div>

				<div class="content">Kaixo Guys,<br />Why not get on to the relevant Government agencies with a view to Heritage/culture and house the proposed&quot;club house&quot; one of the numerous Dublin heritage buildings that have un used rooms or space, Buildings comming to mind eg on Earl street where the Heraldry offices or a fine Georgian Building who may have had a whiskey buff born such as Dram Stoker,Oliver john Gogarty etc,iÂ´m sure an established  smaller heritage centre such as Bloomsday would love to be associated with our Society to attract more tourists or to add more attractions to their events.<br />Or how about afficiacion with simular clubs ie Irish Kilt Society,the Bagpipers club cigar clubs,and share costs and facilities....<br />Remember Dublin had a week long whiskey bonded warehouse fire fado fado 17....in the Cork street area.<br />Agur,</div>

				<div class="content">Reading Pilgrim's comment suddenly made me remember all the cellars in Dublin that used to house the maturing whiskey of the Dublin distillers and bonders. Below the George's St Arcade, for example. Mitchell's had one too somewhere... Fitzwilliam St? It escapes me for now. Not currently used, anyway.<br /><br />No doubt they are in need of a bit of fixing-up but how appropriate would that be?</div>

				<div class="content">Kaixo Guys,<br />Dont forget Irish Whiskey is a heritage product,tourism in the &quot;Aul Sod&quot; is slowing down,,so a new influx of whiskey tourists could be welcome,and we are in &quot;El Crisis&quot; remember.Its worth checking out licencing in reference to bars,pubs clubs etc,a lot of these historic actually had bars of some description ie Leinster House,,now theirs an idea...imagine the bars in Leinster house,the new B&amp;B  in the Phoenix pk etc run by the I.W.S.that would add a few aul KUDOS to the society.or if in an old bonding cellar or in the Wicklow mts call it &quot;The Hell fire club&quot; the bucks in that club used to drink a strange whiskey based concoction,name escapes me....<br /><br />I like the Cellar idea meself, a whiskey bonders cellar adds Provenence..Cool !!</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure how or if it affects the cost of the licence but the SMWS used to open only on a limited basis.  I can remember when the Vaults in Leith were only open Friday/Saturday and they gradually built up business from there.  Obviously turnover has to cover the costs or it wont last long.</div>

				<div class="content">The lucky beggers ...<br /><br />I think one of the biggest barriers to us being hosted by some else is the drinks licencing issue. Although we are a private society and if some other person or organisation hosted us this becomes an issue in relation to a drinks licence. And once you approach organisations with drinks licences they usually want more money.</div>

				<div class="content">I've given this some thought and the only legal way to go under irish law is a private members club... I don't know exactly how these are set up in Ireland but it would be interesting to explore... also how do all the sporting organisations run there operations, GAA, Rugby, Soccer &amp; Hockey clubs who have their own bars...</div>
