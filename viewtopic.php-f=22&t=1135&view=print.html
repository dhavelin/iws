				<div class="content">Got to sample a 48 hour old sample of the future Kilbeggan SPS that's being created with the old John Locke's recipe (5% Oats) The nose on this thing was incredible and even at such an extremely young age it didn't taste half bad, if I recall correctly it was 56% alcohol. Perhaps they'll have a special bottling at Whisky Live Dublin 2015/16.<br /><br />Also sampled two experimental Kilbeggan blends. One had a touch of Sherry cask which was almost too simalar to the original to cause much excitement, while the second had a touch of Port cask which left it much spicier and sharper. The overall concensus in the room was that the 2nd, sharper version was preferred.<br /><br />There was also whispers of a rye whiskey being planned for the future.<br /><br />And the boxes for the Kilbeggan 18yo will be in Ireland on June 3rd. Anyone who bought one without the box and would like a box can contact John Cashman and he said he'll sort you out.<br /><br />Overall I preferred The Cooley masterclass to the Kilbeggan one. I think John Cashman is just so passionate about the brand that it really came through in his presentation.</div>
