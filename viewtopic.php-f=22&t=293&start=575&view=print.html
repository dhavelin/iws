				<div class="content">I recently got a miniature bottle of William Jameson original Irish American brand Whiskey.<br />It's 1/10 a pint. The Label states that it contains 25% 20 year old Irish Pot Still Whiskey and 75% Straight Whiskey 18 months old.I though it would have been 2-3 year old Straight Whiskey. A lovely little addition to the collection and for â‚¬6.99 and $12 postage Ebay does have some real bargains</div>
