				<div class="content">Damn! I'm in the hunt for a 1993 Midleton!<br />I'm looking for one for my daughter's 18th birthday next year. I've been collecting fine wines and whiskeys from her birth year to give her as a present/investment. Of course, I'm hoping she'll open one or two and give her oul lad a snifter! <br />I've got her plenty of Scotches, and even a Japanese whiskey, not to mention a 1993 Bushmills single cask and a Knappogue. I don't think sourcing a 93 Cooley should be a problem, though they're not as common as they once were.<br />But I am missing a 93 Midleton. If you happen to have one of those, or if anyone else does, please PM me.<br />Best of luck with selling the others, Adrian, and if I could offer one bit of advice from one dad to another, buy all the birthyear booze now, while it's still halfway affordable!</div>
