				<div class="content">I've voted against the motion. I think it's a bit odd having a pile of smelly, spicy, greasy food at a tasting. It can't help the nose or palate.<br /><br />Also it's a big part of the ticket price (at The Fitzwilliam anyway) while being something I don't get any benefit from, since I don't eat it.<br /><br />Nobody will go hungry if we don't have food since it's easy to pick up a sandwich around town. Leave it up to individual choice, I say.</div>

				<div class="content">I would be of the same opinion, the smell of food does not help the evening in anyway.<br /><br />If food is being served it should be served after the tasting.</div>
