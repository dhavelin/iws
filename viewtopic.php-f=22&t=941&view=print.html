				<div class="content">No, I've looked around for pictures but haven't found any. It will be a traditional bottle, rather than the tall one. The last one was 8 yrs, but had a lot of older stuff in it. I liked it.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes according to the latest episode of Whiskycast, the old Michael Collins Single Malt was made of whiskies of 8 years and older, with the bulk of the malt being 10 years old. They are reverting to a traditional style bottle possibly reto in style.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Brettie ... Michael Collins used to get around Dublin on a bicycle while the Brittish were looking for him. Quite brazen but as they did not know what he looked like he basically traveled around as if he was a local. Fairly cleaver as they never guessed he would of been that in their face without them even knowing it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>
