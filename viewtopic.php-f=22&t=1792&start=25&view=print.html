				<div class="content">I totally agree, it's a gem of a whiskey but too hard to find. I really hope the Irishman make it more readily available. <br /><br />I got it in The Wren's about  6 months ago and it has a following now. I'd have it over Green Spot any day, but I also like the ill fated Redbreast blend so hopefully it doesn't go the same way. <br /><br />I bet if the Redbreast blend was out today it'd be successful, any thoughts?</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think so.  The problem is that I don't care for blends very much.  Not as a snobbish sort of thing either.  Far more work and thought goes into a bog standard blend than a single cask of Glenwhatever.  I don't enjoy the hardness of the grain whisky.  Odly I don't mind grain as much on its own, but it still isn't really my thing.  That doesn't mean I won't drink it.  I enjoy a blend far more than nothing!</div>
