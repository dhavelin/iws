				<div class="content">Hi everyone<br /> As an ex employee of Irish distillers ltd I was lucky enough to be presented with a bottle of Powers gold label Irish whiskey that was specially commissioned to celebrate 40 yrs bottling at it's bottling plant in Fox and Geese, it is presented in a wooden case (not unlike Middleton rare presentation case) and has a special label showing this. there is also a cert to say that this bottle is one of only 150 produced to commemorate bottling from 1965-2005, now although I realise that the whiskey would now only be 9 yrs old , my question to you all is would the fact that only 150 of these particular bottles were produced, would that make this particular bottle of whiskey worth selling to a collector, or hanging on to for a lot longer? Thank you in advance for any help or advice that you may want to give me.<br /><br />Anthony 1960</div>

				<div class="content">The Jameson Three Million Cases Sold bottle retails for 600 euro and there are ten times more of those...<br /><br />You could ask them in the Celtic Whiskey Shop what it's worth. I'm sure they'd be keen to buy it.</div>
