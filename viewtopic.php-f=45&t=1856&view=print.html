				<div class="content">aka &quot;Three Crowns&quot;<br />70 proof<br />This bottle probably from the 1930s <br /><br />Colour: deep gold<br /><br />Nose: big sherry, kerosene, turps, grist, flour, paint, sweet, maple syrup<br /><br />Body: slow to bead, slow moving legs, light in the mouth<br /><br />Palate: big sherry, kerosene, turps, herbicide, bitter chocolate, floral, maple, grist, metallic, cotton candy,<br /><br />Finish: turps, sherry, bitter, herbicide, sherry flavours quite short<br /><br />At first I thought this was a blend that included some grain whisky, but I am having my doubts.  There are a number of possibilities the two most likely are a small amount of grain or pps and malt.  I need another old pps to compare this to...<br /><br />Preliminary score 88 (more to follow)</div>

I can say the the pps is unmistakable and grain, if it is there, is elusive.  Regardless it is a big sherried dram that tastes like more.  I compare it to an old Bow St. or John's Lane in a few weeks and see if that helps me detect any grain in the mix.  Great fun!</div>

				<div class="content">I tried it against a Power's Pot Still from the old John's Lane distillery.  After comparison I believe it is a blend.  Take this with a grain of salt but it seems to lead with the pot still on the nose and early palate the body points to malt whisky and the keel if you will seems to be grain.  The grain is hard to detect, and seems to be a small proportion of the blend.  The sherry encloses the package brilliantly.  If modern blends were like this I'd be a blend drinker.  Bloody good stuff. Final notes to follow, but the rating will go up.</div>

				<div class="content">Side by side with the VR it shows more pot still, age, and sherry.  Moving it up to 90 points.  I'd be happy to drink a bottle of either in one sitting.  I'll bet their full of vitamins and anti-oxidants.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>
