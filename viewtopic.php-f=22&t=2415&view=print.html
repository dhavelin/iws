				<div class="content">Hello fine people of Irish Whiskey Society,  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif" alt="bd)" title="Cheers" /> <br />I've been working on a tool for the past 6 months that I finally feel comfortable enough to share. It helps you sort, search, and find the right bottle of alcohol or cocktail based on your drinking preferences. I recently rebuilt the Irish Whiskey content and thought you guys might like it. <br /><br />This tool comes in the form of an android app  <img src="images/smilies/icon_study.gif" alt="Bo)" title="Book" />   <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/utlforums">http://bit.ly/utlforums</a><!-- m --> and as a website  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif" alt=":geek:" title="Geek" />  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/1EtUkSy">http://bit.ly/1EtUkSy</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What does it do?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" /> <br />Search across a variety of different alcohol types -- whiskey, beer, vodka, tequila, gin, brandy, liqueurs, and more. <br />Gain valuable insights about the value of a bottle based on its characteristics.<br />Utilize my &quot;Smart Rating&quot; to choose the best bottle at a glance. <br />Compare bottles side-by-side based on price, professional reviews, tasting notes, availability, and more. <br />Understand every aspect of the spirit, from production to taste <br />Create your own visualizations using a vast library of data.<br />Review bottles you have tried and share your expertise with others in the community.<br />Add new bottles from your local brewery or distillery.<br />This app also contains a vast cocktail and drinking games database with more than 16,000 cocktails and 200 drinking games. <br />Search for cocktails based on ingredients you already have at home.<br />Create and add your own cocktails and drinking games to share with your friends.<br />Sort by everything from alcohol type to price.Â¬<br />Add your own images and reviews and share them.<br /><br /><br />Feedback<br />What features would make this app/site better for the casual drinker?<br />What issues did you encounter while using the app / if you're drunk is it still usable?<br />Does it satisfy you as a connoisseur and as a relaxed hobbyist?</div>
