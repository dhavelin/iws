				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />I have a bottle of Midleton Housewarming and a bottle of Midleton Academy which I would like to swap (preferably) or maybe to sell if the price is right. Both bottles retail at around â‚¬800 (they are only currently available for sale from one or two specialist outlets due the unique nature of the bottles).<br /><br />In terms of swaps I am interested in the first ten years of Midleton Very Rare i.e. 1984 up to 1993. If you had anything else to offer in that quality/ value bracket I'd consider it. <br /><br />Some of you may know this already but here is some background on both bottles:<br /><br />Housewarming: A unique 500ml bottle to issued to celebrate retiring Master Distiller Barry Crocket's legacy and to welcome successor Brian Nation, this whiskey was a coming together of two whiskies they selected. It was only given to the 500 invited attendees at the opening of the new still house at the Midleton Distillery in 2013. Each bottle is numbered XX/500.<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

		</div><br /><br />Academy: This is an exclusive bottling of Midleton for the Irish Whiskey Academy. You can only get this bottle if you attend the 2-day Academy course in Midleton, and not everyone gets one as far as I know. Single pot still whiskey matured in four American ex-bourbon barrels (two first fill and two second fill).<br /><div class="inline-attachment">
