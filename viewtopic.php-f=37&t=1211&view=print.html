				<div class="content">OK, September is hotting up to be a busy month whiskey wise, there are 2 Society events to look forward to, the booking pages are now open:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookwhen.com/iws">http://www.bookwhen.com/iws</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The first event (21st Sept) is a special evening that our friends in IDL are hosting for us in Bow St, this is a tasting night for a new whiskey that'll be launched later in the month, this tasting event is free to members of the society but booking is essential so we can provide numbers.<br /><br />We have our normal tasting event at the end of Sept (29th) and promises to be an very interesting evening where we'll pick the best value whiskey through a series of head to heads.  All tasting will be carried out blind so there'll be no pre-conceptions to influence the selection, it'll just be the raw whiskey to prove itself.</div>

Will mail you.<br /><br />The SPS night was an very enjoyable night. We got to taste the Greenspot, Redbreast 12yo, Redbreast 15yo, Power's John's Lane 12yo, the Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy. Guided by Liam Donegan same as last time but my first time to meet him. We'd all tasted the whiskeys before so we had a good chat on more technical details and the process which was very enlightening.</div>

				<div class="content">As an SPS fan, I thought that it was a great night. Most of the tasting list has been highlighted above and it's always a pleasure to be able to taste the whiskeys in that particular class side by side. Clearly IDL and of course Midleton in particular are putting a lot of time and expertise into the development of an integral element of what is our national spirit and they should be commended for it. By the sounds of it there are great things in store for the years ahead and it's a journey I'm looking forward to!</div>
