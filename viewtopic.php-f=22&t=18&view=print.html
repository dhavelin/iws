				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Freeney's Bar </span></span> High Street (Shop St)<br /><br />A decent collection of Irish Whiskey (15+)<br /><br />Usually Consisting of Jameson nas &amp; 12yo, Paddy, Powers nas &amp; 12yo Bushmill nas 10yo &amp; 16yo, Blackbush, Michael Collins, Connemara nas, Greenspot, Lockes 8yo, Midleton, Murphys &amp; Tullamore and probably a fe more I cannot remember.<br /><br /><br />They also have a variety of scotch blends but not a whole pile of malts from what I can remember.<br /><br /><br />An excellent bar that has kept a 70's type charm. A great place to stop for a chat as they don't usually have music but there is a TV that shows sport and news.</div>

Very popular with locals and tourists alike and has trad music during the summer months.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Green's</span></span><br /><br />Kinvara, Co Galway<br /><br />Family Run pub in the picturesque harbour village of Kinvara.<br /><br />Real old style pub which is quite small (about 15 foot by 15) . Authentic, worn and lived in ... don't expect the Ritz here. Friendly athmosphere and the entire wall behind the bar has shelves laden with Whiskies of various descriptions. The majority are for display only but they also have a fair selection of Whiskies. They stock Bushmills up to 16yo there is a new IDL plinth(Jameson 12yo, Gold &amp; 18yo Powers 12yo &amp; Midleton) Also Connemara, Greenspot and Redbreast. Plus a few more that I can't figure. Then in scotch they nearly always have a Laphroaig 10yo, Lagavulin 16yo and a Macallan of some sort as well as a few other single malts and a few regular blends plus curios like Pigs Nose and sheep dip. Not huge but enough to satisfy most on a regular night out.</div>
