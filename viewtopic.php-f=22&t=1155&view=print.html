				<div class="content">Does anyone know if Dingle Whiskey Is now up and running? I saw a prospectus last year looking for BES funding but haven't seen any updates since. They were planning on producing five different Irish whiskies Including Dingle Green ( bourbon cask) and Dingle Gold (ex Sherry casks). Would be interested to know if this got off the ground?</div>

				<div class="content">The original project has fallen through, but they are planning a new one. I think there's a brewery or is going to be a brewery on the sight of the creamery where the distillery was to be located and the Porterhouse people are looking at another site. Don't know how far along the line it is. Anyone speaking to them at Whisky Live.</div>

				<div class="content">The Dingle brewery is up and running on the creamery site, looks very impressive. As for the Porterhouse they have started distilling gin in the the last week or two with whiskey to follow.</div>
