They have used oak chips in wine for years?<br /><br />Compas Box when they originally came out with their inovative Spice Tree they inserted Oak staves in to their young whisky casks to improve (and accelerate) the oak influence. Unfortunately this fell foul of the SWA and it was eventually banned. Managed to get a couple bottles of the original at the time of release though and the Spice Tree was actually a very nice whisky. I still have one in storage hoping it will be worth a small fortune in years to come  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  doubtful though  <img src="images/smilies/drunken_smilie1.gif" alt=":drunk:" title="Drunk" /></div>

				<div class="content">When you think that the vast majority of TD whiskey is Midleton it'd be interesting to figure out how many cases all the brands produced there sell annually. <br /><br />You have 5 millions cases of Jameson, nearly a million in TD, and whatever all the various other Midleton brands add up to. If you wanted to be really pedantic you could also say that a good chunk of what is sold as Bushmills is also Midleton whiskey - about 70% of white bush and 20% of Black Bush as far as I know.</div>

				<div class="content">I suppose you could say a chunk of Tullamore's stuff is Bushmills too. <br /><br />The article says that they bought the distillery for 400 million, sold it for 560 million, making a 160 million profit. That kind of ignores the 100 million investment. I suppose they would have made some profit too.</div>

McHardy is obviously well involved here with the introduction of both West Cork Original Irish Whiskey &amp; West Cork 10 Year Single Malt bottlings. However we are still no nearer to knowing what is actually going on down there. All this cloak and dagger stuff is just silly. They should be open and talk freely about what and how they are doing down there.<br /><br />I'm all for inovative ideas but I also want to know exactly what I'm drinking and how it is produced.</div>
