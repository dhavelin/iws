				<div class="content">I've always liked the Bush 21. It's a funny one though - very subtle mix of tastes I think. I drank it alongside the Bush 16 and the Knappogue 16 last night - despite being 5 years younger the other 2 are much heavier whiskeys. Definitely not the big bold flavours that would appeal to someone on a peat or sherry buzz but for me I always have one on the go. <br /><br />It does vary from batch to batch and I think the earlier ones are heavier and more assertive - I finished a 2008 last night but my previous was a 2002. It's funny, I think, that Bushmills don't make a bigger deal of the year of release - they could easily have gone down the Midleton VR route and tried to drum up interest in different releases. You can barely make out the year on the label.<br /><br />I'd love to see it at 46% and ncf though.</div>

				<div class="content">A 10 year old from the Macallan matured in sherry casks,with a beautiful Macardles traditional ale.<br /><br />Ah now ..........i can see the frowns already. I truly can not find a better beer to go with Whiskey or  Scotch than a big Mac and no cheese.<br />It strange i opened the Macallan last week and was now overly impressed but tonight i like it. I haven't drank since Thursday so that could be the reason.<br />You know the one &quot;hunger it the best sauce&quot; perhaps there is an equivalent saying for Whiskey. Thirst tempts the tastebuds or something.</div>

				<div class="content">Basil Hayden's 8yo ... this is a lovely easy drinking bourbon ... even glugable  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br />However in saying that there is plenty of taste there too. Plenty of sweet as you would expect (Vanilla and ameretto) and some lovely wood spice and white pepper.<br /><br />Very pleasing and is possibly my new favourite as I sometimes find certain Bourbons a bit too heavy at times.<br /><br />Well worth a go and possibly the perfect bridge between Irish and US whiskey.</div>
