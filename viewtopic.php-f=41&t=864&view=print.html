				<div class="content">Difficult to value but in excess of €750 would be my guess. Distilled 19 March 1959 and bottled 7 June 1993 @57.1%  396 bottles only.<br /><br />At the peak I'd say over a €1,000. But very difficult to find someone to part with that kind of money these days...</div>

				<div class="content">Would somebody mind filling me in on Coleraine whiskey in general please?<br />A friend bought me a bottle of the basic Coleraine and it's a lovely weekday whiskey. I'm curious about the rarer versions of it.<br />Who makes Coleraine these days? It used to be Bushmills but Diageo only bought the license to make Bushmills (AFAIK).<br />Just curious so all information is welcome.</div>

				<div class="content">What sort of extra information you looking for?<br /><br />Coleraine Distillery was established in 1820 &amp; closed in 1978. It was aquired by Bushmills in 1946. However Coleraine they only produced single malt till 1964 and most of it's output was actually bottled as Bushmills after the Bushmills take over. They had a Coffee still installed in 1954 which produced the Grain whiskey for Bushmills but ceased operation in 1978 drawing a close to the Distillery.<br /><br />The 34yo is a highly regarded Single Malt and is one of the most valuable of Irish Whiskeys. This initially retailed at £300 a bottle but now commands prices in excess of £700. If a bottle of this came on the market the best place for it would be a propper auction. McTears in Scotland being an auction house that has sold a few and got good money for them.</div>
