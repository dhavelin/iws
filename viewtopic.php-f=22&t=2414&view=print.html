				<div class="content">Was just checking what whiskies Tesco had in stock and came across this— Jameson Dublin Heart and Home Limited Edition.<br /><br />Do you folks reckon this is worth buying or is it a gimmick that's sold out of novelty?<br /><br />Seems strange that it costs only €25, too...<br /><br />Shall I give it a go and review it or keep it sealed and hope that one day, it becomes valuable? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Also noticed that they now stock Connemara! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Standard edition but still. Bravo Tesco <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">It's a bit of a gimmick but at that price it's worth a punt. I've no doubt it will gain value in the future but how much you'd never guess. The whiskey is the standard Jameson. I picked up a couple of those type bottles over the years and hopefully their worth more now. I know the Distillery Horse and Cooperage are sought after. <br />Tescos havd got much better with their range and hopefully it'll improve even more.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm afraid to buy it in case it's made using bad batches of regular Jameson. The price seems too fishy to me <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />There's so many great Irish whiskies on sale at the moment in honour of St. Patrick's day. Bushmills is only €20 in Centra near me. Paddy and Tullamore D.E.W. are both below €25 in SuperValu as well <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">I think you safe buying it Stephen. I'm certain if Jameson did have a bad batch they'd dump it before risking their reputation. I'll be picking up a bottle, the doomsday clock indicates that I should stock up in case.</div>
