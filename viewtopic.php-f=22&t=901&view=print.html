				<div class="content">Okay, new to all of this, so no crass comments on my stupidity.  Now, IrishWhiskeyChaser you suggested that I purchase Irishman whiskey cask strength rare.  Question back to you is, where do I find it?  Only 600 bottles came to the states and the whiskey exchange is out of it.  Anyone got a spare bottle?  The Connemara Cask strength that you mentioned, I am still researching.  I do believe you are correct when stating that I need to look for a higher strength other than 40%.  At this point I am looking for something like this for the holidays, because he said I couldn't find anything for him and that tells me I will find something.  haha.  I may have to move heaven and earth to find it, but I am slightly bullheaded.  <br /><br />Now, I knew Bushmills was in the north but I know nothing of Midleton and Bow St in Dublin.  Let alone, where is Jameson located?  I have done some reading about Midleton and was eyeing a bottle of Midleton very rare from 2009.  What do you know about this?  Does Jameson make anything above 40%?   The trip between distilleries should not be a bad one.  Ireland is not that big and I like to drive.  Thanks, Jenn</div>

				<div class="content">The Midleton and Bow Street that IWC referred to are defunct distilleries that are now tourist attractions. Jameson used to be made at Bow Street (in Dublin) and is now made at a new distillery in Midleton (Cork).<br /><br />I think you set the bar very high with the Jameson Rarest so how about going for something less expensive but still interesting this time. Kilbeggan Distillery Reserve Malt is the first whiskey from Kilbeggan Distillery in over 50 years and only recently released. It is truly something new in Irish whiskey, and it tastes great too.<br /><br />Connemara Turf MÃ³r is close to being releaed. It's Connemara, but with extra peat. We are all looking forward to trying it.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there Jenn, after setting the bar high with the Jameson RVR the following is a selection to consider.<br /><br />Midleton Very Rare 2009 is the classically recognised Irish Whiskey delicate and complex at the same time (available Worldwide)<br />Greenspot is an icon of the traditional pure pot still style (most easily found in Ireland)<br /><br />Irishman 70 (Clan in the US) or Writer's Tears are both everyday whiskies that can be enjoyed by anyone.<br /><br />Bushmills would have to be the 16yo or the 21yo which are amazing whiskies (the distillery reserve is not bad either)<br /><br />Cooley have a wide range of whiskies and any of the Tyrconnell or Connemara single casks are worth trying, the CelticWhiskeyShop usually have these.<br /><br />In terms of visiting Ireland there are six whiskey centers you can visit.<br /><br />Bushmills Distillery near the Causeway coast in the north of Ireland.<br />Cooley's Riverstown Distillery, Riverstown, Co. Louth (by appointment)<br />Cooley's Kilbeggan micro-distillery and Locke's Heritage museum, Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath<br />Tullamore Heritage Centre, small visitor's centre, Tullamore, Co. Westmeath <br />Jameson Bow Street visitors centre, Smithfield, Dublin<br />Midleton Heritage Centre, Midleton Co. Cork<br /><br />and the CelticWhiskeyShop in Dawson Street, Dublin (Ireland's largest selection of whiskey)</div>

				<div class="content">Good afternoon Whiskey Bro, <br />You have given much information to look through.  It is fabulous to get that from you.  So the question to you also is, after having Jameson RVR what would you like to drink?  Something though that is stronger and smooth.  Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">The lucky recipient of the JRVR might be referring to something with more body rather than alcoholic strength. As a general rule of thumb older whiskies such as those included in the JRVR have a tendency to be mellower and smoother.<br /><br />The Bushmills 21yo is a fine whiskey and I'd be very happy if I was given a gift of this whiskey.<br /><br />More recently Midleton (Jameson) have released in the US a whiskey called Redbreast 15yo which is another Irish pure pot still whiskey, it is a smooth full bodied whiskey with a lovely spicy mouthfeel and bottled at 46% abv, similarly its younger brother the Redbreast 12 year old (Jim Murrays Irish Whiskey of the Year 2010) is also a great whiskey and can be easily found in the US. I enjoy both on a regular basis.</div>

				<div class="content">+1 on the Bush 21. A truly superb whiskey, and a bargain at US prices compared to over here.<br />As IWC said, the 16 yo Bushmills is a mighty whiskey too, and much more affordable. But if we're talking the Jameson RVR price bracket, go for the 21 yo Bushmills.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd recommend one of the Bushmills single cask whiskies 50%+, especially the Sherry Cask.  <br />Tyrconnel Pot/Sherry/Madeira are all 46% and so taste much 'fuller' and 'stronger' in my view at least.<br />Redbreast 15yo is bottled at 46% and like the above is non-chillfiltered which again means it is much more full-bodied on the palate.<br /><br />Try to source them in the US on a site such as wine-searcher.com or try samswines,com, missionliquors.com, binnys benerage depot or try this guy in Rhode Island <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.joyalsliquors.com/">http://www.joyalsliquors.com/</a><!-- m --> I highly recommend the last guy Joyal he's a real character and doesn't make it difficult to give him money.

				<div class="content">Yes a single cask cask strength Bushmills would be a cracker but they are harder to come by these days. Good call  ... Mr Lavin (But don't worry your secret is safe with me  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  )</div>
