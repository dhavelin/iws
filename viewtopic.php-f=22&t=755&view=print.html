				<div class="content">Sorry to hear that JC. That kind of news puts the fact that a distillery doesn't want to promote its' portfolio in this country to the max, well into the shade. Hope something turns up soon for you.</div>

I'm picking up a bottle tomorrow (morning) - have to head to Shannon Hbr and its en-route.<br /><br />If anyone wants one, I can pick up and bring to Thursday's tasting (up to a max of 6 btls) - I understand they're €50 each.  <br />Michael</div>

				<div class="content">And here's a first look (I'll sample later tonight ...)<br />I'm very very happy to see Brian Quinn's signature on the bottles.  Anyone who has toured the distillery can only be impressed with what has happened in Kilbeggan since the Community stepped in to rescue the place eons ago.  They should be bursting with pride on seeing this &quot;labour of love&quot; through to fruition.<br />I note that the label claimes &quot;the world's oldest pot still&quot; and the &quot;world's oldest distillery&quot;.  The latter claim is also found on Bushmills labels.  I'm delighted to see Kilbeggan distillery claim its proper place in the pantheon of wiskey history.  The bottle is also a new one on me, taller than the &quot;standard&quot; one.<br />/Michael<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">I should of course have emphasised that the fact that the restaurant attached to Kilbeggan Distillery do the best &quot;Full Irish Breakfast&quot; in the country, bar none, had no influence whatsoever in my stopping by earlier this morning.  What a pity I arrived a half hour before the shop opened.  Sure, what was a man to do????<br /><br />I speak with some authority on the subject!

				<div class="content">Got my hands on a couple today  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />and for what it is worth here are my tasting notes ... a bit tiered today so not sure if I really got into it but luckily there is plenty there to get into.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Nose:</span> A much heavier nose than the Cooley Riverstown style. Even though at only 40% it seems to have a bit of nose prickle. Pungent sweet Malt (not over powering though), plasticine &amp; a touch of rubber, stewed fruits ( apple orange and lemon) with cinnamon, (Think of a mulled wine without the wine if you get my drift). <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Taste: </span>Lovely Tartness at the start, hot in parts even (probably due to the youth of this Malt) but there is a lovely soft mouth feel to this whiskey... the stewed fruits continue in the taste with Cinnamon but also almond, A little wood and a spice sparkle on the tongue. Lovely and rich flavours all intermingle like a sweet rich Belgium beer all underlined by sweet sugary syrup however possibly a touch of bitter wood sap which is a slight negative.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Finish:</span> The spice and rich sweetness fades into a drying warm finish where the spice and wood remains on the tongue and to me is quite long.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Over all:</span> Sweetness and Spice. An intriguingly unique and enjoyable Irish Malt full of flavour that be-lies its age even though it probably is a tad immature. However it is well worth the punt in my view. I wonder if it is coloured though as it has a grand golden hue. On first visit I really liked this but I suppose I should reserve judgement until I give it a few more goes.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Cooley%20Stable%20Brands/DistilleryMaltKilbeggan.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
