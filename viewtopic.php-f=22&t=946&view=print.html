				<div class="content">Welcome to the Forum Frank<br /><br />A fairly easy drinking Irish Whiskey that will not offend ... a bit of fun more that anything else if you ask me. Created by Northern Irish business man Shane Braniff(sic) but I don't think it's overly available down south.<br /><br /><br />Edit: Just see they have changed site a bit. Their description of &quot;smooth, gentle and sweet&quot; is pretty spot on  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">I've got a bottle and I like it ... like mentioned it's not too over the top (which is probably why I like it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> ).  The Feckin Spiced whiskey was not really to my liking but I've never been a fan of spiced spirits (e.g. Captain Morgan Rum).</div>

				<div class="content">nice light tasting whiskey for me.  won't disappoint and won't knock your socks off either.  back in PA in the states it was priced at $19.99.  for the same price you can get michael collins and in my opinion, collins is a much nicer whiskey for the money.  not sure how much it costs everywhere else though.</div>
