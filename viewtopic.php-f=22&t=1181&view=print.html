				<div class="content">Hello all,<br />Is there an Irish whiskey course available in Ireland? I have looked at most of the summer or night classes and while there are many wine courses there is none for whiskey. I have seen the Scotch Whisky Certificate Course that is run by the Scotch Whisky Experience on the Royal Mile, Edinburgh and a course like that on Irish whiskey would be prefect. Maybe someone here can start a course that could be processed along the same lines, i.e. a one day course. I have gained a great deal of appreciation and some knowledge of whiskey from the various posts and blogs available here and would really like to boost that by taking such a course. Looking at the prices they charge in Edinburgh I am sure it would be profitable for whoever starts it up. <br /><br />Slaint√©<br /><br />Macthepirate</div>
