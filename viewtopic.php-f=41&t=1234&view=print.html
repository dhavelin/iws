				<div class="content">You'll not be able to date these to a specific year unless you can figure out the Tax Stamps. However mid 70's is the oldest these bottles would be and I would even bet they are more likely early 80's.<br /><br />Powers sold it's whiskey solely as Pure Pot Still up till 1975. Your Powers is a blend hence a post pot Still time frame.<br /><br />From a collectable point of view there is not much of a difference whether these are 1970's or 80's anyway and will not be worth much. €25-40.<br /><br />In an auction which finished this week-end. A very similar Jameson made €27 and 2 x Powers made €11 &amp; €17 which is very disappointing ... but still nothing major.<br /><br />The Pot Still bottlings are the ones that are collectable.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, these Powers used to go for more, but there's a lot of them around. One when for over 100 euro on whiskyauction this year, though. I don't understand why. The one I had/have has a 1976 tax stamp on it.</div>

Obviously a couple of people did not do their home work and got carried away. Average price seems to be around €40. I used to pay around the 50Euro for mine but they seem much cheaper these days.<br /><br />Check out<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://whiskyauction.com/">http://whiskyauction.com/</a><!-- m --><br />Click on <br /><br />Results Database<br />History (All)<br />World<br /><br />And Select Ireland in the  <br /><br />Select Distillery: Brandname tab<br /><br />There you will have all the Irish bottles sold on this auction site over the years and there are plenty examples like what you have.</div>
