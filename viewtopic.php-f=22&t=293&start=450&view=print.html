				<div class="content">Lets see. I picked up a Redbreast 15 that I have been looking forward to trying. As for bourbon I picked up the following:<br /><br />Four Roses Yellow Label: 6 bottles<br />Four Roses Single Barrel: 6 bottles<br />Four Roses Small Batch: 6 bottles<br />Old Fitzgerald BIB: 1 liter bottle<br />Buffalo Trace: 1 case<br />Old Charter 10 year old: 1 case<br />Eagle Rare 10 year old: 1 case<br /><br />These are for my own use. I have to order these as I cannot get them in Southeast New Mexico where I live and have to order them and pay shipping which eats your lunch. When I travel I stock up on items that I have to order. Needless to say my bunker is full . The truck was loaded down and the liquor store clerk was happy to see me come in. It was a successful trip bunker wise <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

Up until now (2011) the Green Spot was  distributed by Mitchell &amp; Son only, from now on most likely it will be in the portofilio of Pernod Ricard.<br /><br />So you hopefully get it on your side in the future.</div>

				<div class="content">Redbreast Blend or Redbreast Pure Pot Still? - The vast majority of Redbreast over the years has been Pure pot still in various versions of the &quot;dumpy&quot; bottle. There was briefly a blend in a more standard taller bottle in the mid 2000s. Didn't last too long and wasn't that well received but i thought it was ok.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah I know that one - It's a blend but pretty definitely not from the 70's - the recycling logo is a dead giveaway if nothing else - you're talking about 21st century.<br /><br />Still though I haven't seen one of these in ages - if you don't mind me asking where did you pick them up - I'd love to get another one to try.</div>
