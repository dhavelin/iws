				<div class="content">Welcome Lukie, and hopefully you can gleem a few nuggets of information off our humble forum. Feel free to talk about any whiskey or whisky you like in the general Whiskey forum. We do not solely limit our discussions to Irish whiskey and you'll find many of us if not the majority like Scotch and other world whiskies too.<br /><br />Tip for you by the way ... as you travel alot when passing through travel retail start picking up Mini's as they usuall have a few packs with 2 or 3 mini's in them. A cheap way to explore different whiskies.</div>

				<div class="content">John, here. From West Virginia.<br /><br />Bourbon drinker, primarily, Kentucky, Tennessee, and now Virginia. But am starting to do what I hope will be some significant reading, and a bit of tasting, to see about the Irish whiskeys.  I'm interested In learning how to discern the differences, one brand to another, and as they age; what are considered to be the characteristics of quality. I suppose I should add the single malts scotch into the equation too, but I'm not sure I could keep it all straight. For now, I'd like to better understand the Irish whiskeys.  Really, I'd also like to find a tasting course on the Irish offerings that are available in the US. Thank you, in advance, for any thoughts and help. John</div>

				<div class="content">Hi John and welcome. <br /><br />You arrived at a great time for Irish whiskey. There has been a resurgence in recent years. We have single grains, malts, peated malts, and blended like our Scottish cousins. Our blends are quiet different in their make up. <br />The one thing that is unique to Irish Whiskey is our Pot Still whiskeys or Single Pot Stills as they are now been called. I recommend you try some of these. The easiest to find stateside should be Redbreast. It has a variety of ages and you'll find their all good. If you can get you hands on Powers John's Lane 12 year old, you'll be very happy. It's a great whiskey. <br /><br />Let's is know how you getting on with the tastings.</div>

You may need to downsize the image.<br /><br /> I'll send you an email and you send the photo and I'll post it if you wish. <br /><br />Without seeing the label it's only a guessing game.<br />The shape, colour, label writing and capsule would all need to be discussed. <br /><br />I for one am intrigued.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi everyone<br /><br />Hi everyone - Conan here, from Antrim.<br /><br />Just joined the forum this evening whilst enjoying a wee Redbreast. Pretty new to whiskey, having previously generally gone for beer, but the in-laws in Fermanagh meant it was hard not to end up with a Jamesons any time I was down (or poitin, depending on what they had in). Started off on standard Jamesons and Bushmills, but trying to expand a bit - so far, quite like Jamesons Select Reserve and Redbreast (only have the 12 year).  Won a bottle of Bushmills Millenium on McTears auction last week and looking forward to delivery of that.<br /><br />Not adverse to Scottish whiskies, like Lagavulin and Laphroig well enough, and haven't tried anything from any other countries yet.<br /><br />Next on the list to try is Green Spot. More than happy for any suggestions on what to try after that.<br /><br />I happen to be in London next Friday/Saturday, so think I might go to WhiskyLive and see what I can find myself.  If anyone else is going, I might see you there.<br /><br />Sláinte<br /><br />Conan</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome to the forum, Conan!<br /><br />It's a good time to be getting into Irish whiskey. We are all looking forward to tracking the developing whiskeys from the various new distilleries.<br /><br />For suggestions... The whole Redbreast family is worth exploring. Powers John's Lane is a favourite of many. Teeling are doing all sorts of interesting things. Since you are in Antrim, the Bushmills 12yo that you can only buy at the distillery is very nice.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome Conan,<br /><br />As David said its a good time to get into Irish Whiskey. <br /><br />I'd also go for the Redbreast range. The Powers John's lane is awesome, the Spot range is good too. If you at WhiskyLive it's worth visiting the Irishman/Writers Tears stand. They have come up with a great range of whiskeys in the last few years. Writers Tears is a beautiful Pot Still blend. <br /><br />Best of luck in London.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br />My name is Pye and I am Swede.<br />I enjoy very much an Irish dram every now and then and I am also a devoted whisky collector. I have been doing it for 30 years and its only the wallet that is holding me back. The subjects has been changing  over the years. In the beginning it was just any that I didnt have in the collection ,going over to the Rare Malt Serie from United Distillers,but I found out I didnt have the economic muscels for that.Now I am interrested in Irish and Japaneese whiskies. I have also been engaged in conducting a small whiskyclub since 1992 with 25 members.We have meetings only four times a year testing 3-4 whiskies ,and was also a contributor to the start of the Swedish Whisky Association ,now with over 200 joined whiskyclubs with over 8000 members . I am also  engaged in a small company trying to release 2 editions of independing Whisky bottlings every year under the brand name &quot;Part Nan Angelen&quot; or the angels share in gaelic.</div>

I'd like to hear your opinion on some of the Irish whiskeys you've tried. I'm a fan of others too. Japanese Whisky has become popular in recent years. <br /> <br />Hopefully you can pass on your knowledge and maybe tell us a thing or two about Irish whiskey. <br /><br />I read your other post and it sound interesting.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there and Thanks for the welcome!<br /><br />The &quot;site&quot;is just a temporary test site I put up myself for the last few months after I resurrected the web domain which had been parked for many years.<br /><br />A more professional site will be launched there in a few weeks so all suggestions on what you would all like to see on IrishWhiskey.com are welcome.<br /><br />Those who know me will confirm that I have been a Green Spot Fan for many many years and long before it became trendy.<br /><br />My first introduction to Whiskey was in the mid 80s after this West Cork man left college in Dublin to work in the North Donegal / Derry area. It was there that a colleague and mentor who was a surrogate Father figure to many of us young lads introduced us to Black Bush. No ice and certainly no lemonade or mixers but he showed us all how a little water would open up the whiskey and he also showed us how to drink responsibly. The rest as they say is history. I was introduced to Jemmy 12 year old when working in the Middle East and this then led me to Midleton which led me to Green Spot. <br /><br />My name in Irish is MacConnmara which means Son of the Hound of the Sea (Pirate) so my  gift to colleagues I would visit abroad would always be a little three miniature +Glass Connemara Gift pack  which I would buy 10 of from Jean and Colette (the Cooley dynamic sister duo) in Dublin airport. I would then run a simple whiskey tasting with the packs when on business abroad on the night we hosted ourselves to return the hospitality of our foreign friends. Again, my &quot;lesson&quot; would focus on showing beginners how to drink and appreciate Irish whiskey as taught to me 30 years ago, The Pirate angle helped as well!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />My current cabinet includes Green Spot, Tullamore DEW, Black Bush, a Kilbeggan or two, Greenore Teeling Single Grain and Reserve, Red Breast of course being from Cork, Green Bush (Malt) some poiteen from Connemara <img src="images/smilies/drunken_smilie1.gif" alt=":drunk:" title="Drunk" /> I would describe myself as an aficionado. I'm certainly not a connoisseur. <img src="images/smilies/icon_study.gif" alt="Bo)" title="Book" />   <br /><br />Looking forward to getting to know everyone!<br /><br />I'd also love to hear your suggestions for my new site.<br /><br />I have two other Irish Whiskey projects underway as well and will share these in coming weeks! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Stuart</div>

				<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br /><br />my name is Mareike and I am new at the Irish Whiskey Society. I come from Germany and I am interested in Irish Whiskey. 4 years ago I started to being interested in Whiskey and tried several Whiskey types and decided that Irish Whiskey is the best I like.<br /><br />In Germany Irish Whiskey became more popular during the last two years but before that time it was difficult to find Irish Whiskey in Germany. So I started to build up an online shop especially for Irish Whiskey. At the I have nearly 100 different Irish Whiskeys in my stock and I am very proud of that.<br /><br />I hope to get some new ideas and information about Irish Whiskey at this forum and maybe there will be a possibility to meet each other in Ireland one time. I am always searching for special Irish Whiskeys which I may take to my shop. If you are interested I would love to get a feedback for my website.<br /><br />I was in Ireland two weeks ago and visited Slane Castle, Bushmills Distillery, Tullamore, Kilbeggan and Jack Teeling. It was a very interesting tour. Last year I did also Midleton and Jameson. Next year I would like to visit all the new distilleries. My favourit Irish Whiskey is the Knappogue 14 year Twin Wood but in Dublin I tried the Teeling 26 year old one and it is also a great whiskey.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Mareike</div>
