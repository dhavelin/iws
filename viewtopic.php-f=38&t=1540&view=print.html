				<div class="content">Hi chintz,<br /><br />Cannot say for sure myself as it is a very different market in a way. Some Irish Whiskey Mirrors or whiskey-inalia can fetch some very high prices if they are old and original branded products. However I have never heard of O'Connell &amp; Flynn as a Distillery or as a brand before or even Galway Bay distillery. This may have been made specially for a pub or just a spurious reproduction look mirror. Looks like a decent size so it should be worth something but what I could not say. Hopefully someone else may have any idea.</div>

				<div class="content">I've seen it before on a few occasions during eBay searches. It could be a one of those whiskey names made up for the Irish pub markets but it seem to come up in google searches too.<br />I came across a metal sign for Devereux distillery on a German site recently. I've never seen one on an Irish site.<br />Another distillery was Andrew Jameson's one down here that you'd never see anything about.<br /><br />I have done a quick scan of The Lost Distilleries of Ireland and could not find any mention either. <br />If I find any info i'll let you know.</div>
