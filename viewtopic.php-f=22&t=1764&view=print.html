				<div class="content">I have a feeling both are blends. Dunvilles (Thye Royal Irish Distillery) distilled pps, malt and grain whiskey and the majority of their product was reported as being blended as they had a huge blending operation. However there is no definitive answer as all bottles that I have seen don't seem to suggest either way what is in the bottles. However you are probably safe in the knowledge it is all the out put from a single distillery.</div>

But mainly my thoughts of blends come from the fact it was started by merchants who started business as blenders in the first place. So more of a Johnnie Walker (who also started as a merchant and blender) mentality rather than a single distillate mentality I would have thought.<br /><br />If we can nail down evidence that would be great.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Indeed, however, I will make note of the word &quot;liqueur&quot; on the bottle.  In my experience (not that I have made a careful study -- stand by) a &quot;liqueur&quot; whisky tends to be, if not exclusively, then commonly a pot still or malt only whisky.</div>

				<div class="content">Blending was a tricky business due to the fact that each run produced<br />slightly different taste. If you consider the season and the farm that the<br />mash was produced from even that changed the end result slightly, i <br />imagine experience tasters could tell. So the origional purpose of<br />blending was to produce a more consistent product.<br />So this was developed later in the life of the distillery and<br />was almost perfected by the end of its time. It was an attempt<br />at consistency</div>

				<div class="content">Since it is clear the Royal Irish Distillery was distilling in the early 50s it raises a number of questions.  The biggest is what happened to the whisky!?!  Aside from the Cadenhead's 150th bottling (a single cask I think) I know of no other bottling of the whisky.  It wasn't sold under the Dunville's name.  Did it go into Belfast brands like Club?</div>

				<div class="content">I thought brands like Club and Yates were bottled in the 70's. I would think they were not aged that long, but I'm not sure. <br /><br />I have just dug out an old Club poster and it appears that the bottle has a cork and was called Liqueur whisky which indicates that it's probably 60's. I'm only speculating here.</div>

It does pre-date a statement of volume and the screw cap looks like an older style.  That said I have no idea where the whisky inside comes from and I don`t know when it became mandatory to state volume on packaging in the UK.<br /><br />It all seems very strange.  Even if the distillery only ran for a few weeks there`d be quite a bit of whisky as it was a big distillery with large stills.  <br /><br />McGuire`s Irish Whisky doesn`t say anything about it in the 50s.<br /><br />I wonder who had the license to distill at that time as I think Dunville`s was wound up completely with all stock disposed by the end of the 40s.</div>

Note the screw cap is not identical but it is of a wide non standard version similar to that of the Club (if my eyes are not deceiving me).<br /><br />These clubs seem to pop up quite regular, which makes me think they have been around up till recently (i.e. possibly 60's or even 70's).</div>

				<div class="content">I think 60s or 70s is about right for this one.  I doubt that would have anything from the Royal Irish in it.  That's the problem with these brands, the contents can keep changing, just because one month it is whisky from X does not mean it can't change to Y for the next month.  I wonder if the what ever was produced in the early 50s was disposed of through them?  Seems most likely candidate.</div>
