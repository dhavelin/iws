				<div class="content">William Jameson was the brand from the Marrowbone Lane distillery.  It was part of the Dublin Distillers Co formed in the late 19C and ceased production in 1923.  The last stocks were sold in the 30s.  Old Pot Still Dublin whiskey.  A very nice piece you have there.  Well done, she's a keeper (so's the girl)!</div>

				<div class="content">A book called &quot;The Lost Distilleries of Ireland&quot; is the main source of information for this distillery.<br /><br />Joel has summed it up pretty concisely. Was one of the so called Big four distilleries in Dublin which also included John Jameson's, Power's and Dublin Whiskey Distillery Co Ltd or simply DWD. <br /><br />William Jameson's main market would have been the US but also would have had a market share in Ireland and the UK. It is suggested that William was a close relative of John Jameson and possibly a brother but the 2 Jameson enterprises always were strictly separate affairs. Both were very successful in the 19 and early 20 century but only J.Jameson survived to today.</div>
