There is a fear that they will run short if they continue supplying the independent brands. <br />There was a mention that it may actually encourage them to distill their own. <br />This would be a win win I think. I know it's expensive to start up but if they see the advantages of controlling their own product from the start they may think about it.<br />Irish Whiskey seem to be the ipad/tunes of drink at the moment and hopefully that will continue.</div>
