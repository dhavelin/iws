But I think the description of the salesman - &quot;It's the Redbreast Blend again, isn't it?&quot; - was fair comment.</div>

Remember it was the Irish that first frowned upon the blend especially by the big distilleries. However this was probably from a grain perspective. Tullamore only issued their first blend in 1940's and Powers and Jameson were even later, possibly as late as the early 70's when Midleton came on line. However in the mid 19th century the likes of the watercourse distillery in Cork &amp; Watts in Derry (1833) had big grain distillation output. So there was plenty of grain whiskey in the industry even from an early time. Whether this was used in Irish whiskey products or exported as grain is unclear. PPS though still seemed to be the main attraction at the time for the leaders in the Irish Whiskey industry but smaller independent companies probably blended. I would of thought independent bottles like those coming from obscure companies such as E&amp;B Burke are blends and they like Johnnie Walker (who basically invented the blend) were doing it long before the big PPS companies were forced to do from a financial point of view. So possibly it was done before but as far as I'm aware there was no such mix of any renown which in itself tells a story.<br /><br />However they do say  &quot;a style of whiskey&quot; ... Midleton are masters of making a multitude of whiskies with different and specific character. From this they experimented and have become expert in recreating the whiskies of Jameson Powers &amp; Tullamore amongst others. So I would therefore give them the benefit of doubt that they can recreate a &quot;style&quot; of whiskey. The use of malt may be neither here nor there and was only used as it was the right fit so to speak. <br /><br />Just my slant but you never know maybe just PR mumbo jumbo too  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">It's PR mumbo-jumbo, needless to say.<br />Of course, everything IWC says is correct. There is no evidence I'm aware of that says pot still/malt blends were an established style in the early 20th or late 19th centuries.<br />And if they are echoing some sort of style they believe existed, they should tell us what they're emulating and how they've gone about that.<br />But I suspect they didn't do that, and are merely trying to lock in the link between the whiskey and the popularity of Irish writers.<br />Having said that, I really enjoyed this and demolished my bottle in no time. How are stocks of this, does anyone know?</div>

It is <br />possible the IrishMan whiskey did not fit the Russian market so this was created specially. The writers tears whiskey company may also have been set up due to distributor rights that some companies tie them selves up with. WHo knows but it is a great addition to the Irish Whiskey no matter what the reasons.</div>
