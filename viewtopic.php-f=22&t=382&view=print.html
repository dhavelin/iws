				<div class="content">Good that you got it sold in the end, hope you were ok with the price you ot in the end ... whiskey is a funny business and bottles can go in and out of favour there fore the price can fluctuate. Even though you'd think these are rare they are quite common and seem to be hard to shift these days as most collector would have one. Further it does not help that the whiskey is a bit on the over aged side too so not as desirable as possibly others. <br /><br />Thanks for keeping the thread updated  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I think a lot of people would love the chance to own or sample Old Comber, and prices haven't varied enormously for it. I think what's changed is people's discretionary income in the current climate.<br />Buying an expensive bottle of whiskey is easier to rationalise when the economy's booming, you're seeing a bonus in your wages, and taxes and interest rates are low.<br />But people cut back on that when they see their wages fall, mortgage payments rise and get nervous about the economy.<br />I'd love a bottle of Comber to taste (my father being parsimonious to say the least with the bottle I got for him!) But I just can't justify it at the moment, and I guess that might go for other interested parties too.</div>
