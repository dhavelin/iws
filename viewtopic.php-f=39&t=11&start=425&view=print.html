				<div class="content">Hello All,<br /><br />I'm Michael, Irish but have been in Asia a long time in the hotel industry and now based in China.  Great to see this forum and society, and thanks for letting me join!  I've become more &amp; more of a Whiskey drinker over the past few years, and in particular some of the great Irish Whiskeys.  It is fantastic to see such a revival in Irish Whiskey, and also in the Pot Still traditions.  The Irish range in China is so far generally limited to Jameson's and maybe a Bushmills but there is certainly an increasing interest in Whiskey, including Irish so hopefully that will grow.  I manage a pilgrimage to the Celtic Whiskey Shop (And of course Duty Free) on every trip home and am enjoying some Yellow Spot, Redbreast 12 yr Cask Strength and Connemara these days.  My new favourite though for an every day whiskey is the Teeling Small batch.  <br /><br />Anyway, hopefully I'll be able to contribute in some small way, and nice to meet everyone.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Michael,<br />Welcome to the Irish Whiskey Society. It's interesting to hear how the industry is going in Asia. It's a huge market opening up there.  <br /><br />Is see you have tried a few nice ones. It's great to see the choice improving. Every year there's talk of another start up or a new brand getting launched. Happy days. <br /><br />Sláinte.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome Joe, I hope you enjoy the forum. Bushmills make great stuff. They've been very quiet in the last few years. I wonder do they have any new whiskeys in the pipeline. They were very active a few years ago and came out with some beautiful whiskeys like the Caribbean Rum cask one. <br /><br />Sláinte</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the lead .My interest is family related as my late mother in law was a Jameson  (5th generation from John Jameson) . The Jamesons were a closely knit  but large family and it does seem odd that there were two rival distilleries Marrowbone Lane  run by william Jameson and John Stein , and Bow Street distillery run by John Jameson and his son John junior, operating in Dublin in apparent competition at about 1800. Maybe this was a secret cartel  and they were not in competition ? William died in 1802 aged only 25 and in the same year John junior married  Isabella Stein ,John Stein's daughter  . I know many marriages were arranged for economic reasons but all this looks strange if the distilleries were really in competition. I suspect that there may have been some arrangement made between John Jameson and John Stein but we may never know <br />Michael Treays.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />First time poster so go easy on me!<br /><br />Well I started collecting Irish Whiskey a few years ago. Well, I'm now pregnant with my first child (yay!) and obviously am not consuming alcohol at the moment. With that in mind I looked at my collection (&quot;collection&quot; may be an exaggeration!) the other day and realised that I don't miss it and right now I feel I will never return to alcohol consumption again…….I say this now in sincerity, I may of course regret this further down the line! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So, I'm looking to sell my &quot;collection&quot;…..it mainly consists of Irish Distillers Whiskeys, but I have some Bushmills expressions too. I have more than one of pretty much all of the following if anyone is interested:<br />Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy<br />Midleton Very Rare 2012<br />Redbreast 15 Year Old<br />Redbreast 12 Year Old<br />Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength Batch 1<br />Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength Batch 2<br />Green Spot<br />Yellow Spot<br />Powers Signature Release (US only expression I think, though not 100% certain on that)<br />Powers Johns Lane<br />Bushmills 10 Year Old<br />Bushmills 16 Year Old<br />Bushmills 21 Year Old Madeira Finish<br /><br />On most of the above I have the 750ml versions as I lived in the US until recently so there's extra value there lol.<br /><br />And now the really good stuff:<br />Jameson Vintage Reserve 2007 <a href="http://shop.jamesonwhiskey.com/collections/whiskeys/products/jameson-rarest-vintage-reserve" class="postlink">http://shop.jamesonwhiskey.com/collections/whiskeys/products/jameson-rarest-vintage-reserve</a> Beautiful packaging if you haven't seen them before.<br />Jameson &quot;Thanks a Million&quot; Bottle - never for sale to general public, I paid a small fortune for this…:( Apparently only 1500 made.<br /><br />I'm selling all of them slightly below cost if anyone is interested (though I'm not looking to be fleeced!)? Might make for slightly cheaper presents…..<br /><br />The two Jamesons at the end however I won't part with cheaply however. <br /><br />Drop me a line if you're interested.</div>
