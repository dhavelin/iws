				<div class="content">A shout out to those of you who have windows phones.<br /><br />A student from DCU has created an app for Windows phone only. This is basically part of her Degree so nobody complain about lack of availability on other platforms  <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> <br /><br />Anyway most of the content is Jameson based with a basic list of a 4 or five Jamesons with tasting notes. A cocktail part again seems to be based on Jameson and some Jameson social media.<br /><br />However there is also a part called Absorb which is basically the news area. This is actually quite interesting and covers all spectrums of the irish Whiskey industry so well worth a download for that alone. A smooth interface and not glitches so far so over all a nice app and it's free so no harm supporting it.<br /><br /><br />{link removed as it was lifting content from another members site}</div>

Would not be out of order to contact the college too if you did not get a response. Further you could also contact windowsphone.com and make them aware if you get no satisfaction.<br /><br />I'll remove the link pronto as is only right.<br /><br />Unfortunately people still do not see the difference at data being freely available on the web for their enjoyment as opposed to copying/plagiarising/reusing with out owner consent which is a totally different kettle of fish. <br /><br />I'll make the Committee aware.Cheers</div>

				<div class="content">I seen the link before IWC took it down. <br /><br />It a pity the permission wasn't sought but the idea and effort is great.<br /><br />It shows that whiskey is finally reaching a wider market and it's no longer viewed as a old mans drink. <br /><br />As David said it seem to be an innocent mistake. We should encourage her. Maybe someone could guide her in her efforts. You'd never know liquid Irish may reach a whole new group of followers. Can only be good in the long run.</div>

				<div class="content">Well if David is happy to guide her maybe she should make it far more obvious where the information is coming from therefore enlightening the user as to Davids site.<br /><br />There were links to the original article but it does not seem to work on the Windows platform. One needs a forum app and none seem to be available in the case for windows users.</div>

But it was quite a shock to see my website republished under someone else's name, effectively. That's more help than I want to provide <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I will add a note to the site to make it clear I don't permit republication on other sites or within apps.<br /><br />There is nothing to stop anyone generating their own content though. It's free to set up a blog, Tumblr, Twitter account or whatever.</div>
