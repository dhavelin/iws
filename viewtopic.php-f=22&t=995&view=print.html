				<div class="content">This thread is for updates on the availability of exclusive and hard to find Irish Whiskey in Terminal 2, Duty Free @ 'The Loop' in Dublin Airport.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Greenore 19 Single Grain</span> Single Cask #1798 d. 05.12.90 b. 29.10.10 @ 60.5% 300 bottles €195<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Midleton Bourbon PPS</span> Single Cask #48709 d. 12.11.91 b. 10.10.10 @ 53.7% 204 bottles? €250<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bushmills Bourbon Barrel </span>Single Cask #298? d. c.1993 b. c.2006? @ 56.5% €175 (Maison du Whisky)<br /><br />Although the above prices are eye watering also worth noting in terms of availability are:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">John L. Sullivan Irish Whiskey</span> 1L @ 40.0%<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Kellan Irish Whiskey </span>1L @ 40.0%<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Jameson Distillers Selection Old Irish Whiskey Aged 12 Years</span> d. 1993 b. 2005? @ 43.0% 5,000 bottles.<br /><br />If you arrive early in Terminal 1 in Dublin Airport, once you are through security and airside you can walk to your left after security, walk to the end of the corridor turn right , take lifts down 1 level at you will find the Irish Whiskey Collection down to the right hand corner of the duty free  shopping area after you come out of the lifts. (About 10/15 mins walk). You can use the shop and collect service if buying at non-duty free prices.<br /><br />It appears they are continually trying to source whiskeys to ensure they have the largest duty free selection of Irish Whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">I hate to be beating the 'value for money' drum AGAIN, but €195 for a 19yo grain whiskey seems way over the top for me. Many of the 21yo quality single malts and blends are available at just over half the cost of that. Where exactly are Cooley going with this pricing strategy?? Their 17yo single malt was priced way under €195!! <br /><br />Maybe however this is probably more the fault of the 'The Loop' (ironic name considering they are defintely not in 'the Loop' when it comes to market value! <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />) From what I can gather from the general commentary on the new stores in T2, the one common feature that they all share is that their goods and services are all priced at a premium, whether the premium is warranted or not!</div>

I wish people wouldn't pay these prices though. We could send a clear signal what we think is a fair price if we kept our money in our wallets. I am optimistic that this is happening with the recession - the whiskey standards seem to be permanently &quot;on offer&quot; these days.</div>

				<div class="content">Don't want to drag this thread off topic at all, but I've been through Heathrow's World of Whiskies twice recently and the prices really do put Dublin to shame. £30 for Bush 16 yo, or £15 for Tyrconnell, for example.<br />However, they simply don't have anything like a decent selection of Irish whiskey at all. (Even worse when it comes to Japanese or World whiskies.)<br />They told me there this morning that they'd love to stock more Irish whiskeys but simply can't source the stock! Can't get the Redbreast 15 yo, or older Tyrconnells or Connemaras, or even the Bush 21 yo. There's not even any Powers or Paddys.<br />Instead, they have a moribund little corner of standard Jamesons, Bush and some Tyrconnell, Kilbeggan blend and regular Connemara, dwarfed by a spectacular range of Scotch.<br />I think that the Irish distillers are missing an opportunity here. The WoW guys told me they get asked about Irish whiskeys all the time, but just can't source them from the manufacturers. Apparently they recently asked IDL about a limited edition, and instead were given the travel retail signature reserve. <br />Heathrow is a major hub for whiskey retail, and in the few minutes I spent there this morning, they must have sold in the region of a £1,000 worth of Scotch. Their prices are keen, and they have a lot of people coming through the place, including many people who are keen to purchase limited, rare and expensive whiskey.<br />I'm delighted to see that Dublin airport now stocks a great range of Irish whiskey. I hope the Irish whiskey industry will build on this and seek to emulate the Dublin range in other airports like Heathrow.</div>

				<div class="content">The shop is open plan and well designed. For me a major plus was how friendly and knowledgeable the staff were, the young fella who served me loved it when I could hold a whiskey conversation with him. Another plus is you can collect your whiskey on the way back from your journey.<br />Good to hear of the plans for T1, Cork and Shannon.</div>

				<div class="content">In the Loop over the weekend, they have a new Midleton Single Cask which is exclusive to the Loop. It's cask number 48710, the first one was 48709. There's 197 bottles and the same price as the first one (250 euro). The guy in the shop said there was 4 casks purchased by the Loop, so 2 down and 2 to go. He also said that Cooley have other exclusives to come to the Loop aswell, to follow the Greenore 19 year old. Plans for a 19 year old Tyrconnal and a Connemara, most likely single casks.</div>
