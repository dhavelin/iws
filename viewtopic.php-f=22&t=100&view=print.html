				<div class="content">Just received two bottles in the post, got hit with the VAT &amp; Duty (ouch) goes with the territory I suppose. Anyway chatting with the postman and he says they are really clamping down at the moment. So for those law abiding citizens among you just be aware that this will most likely happen more frequently. Note to self.... must be more patriotic!</div>

Now, technically you can move as much of either of these as you like in person, provided it's for personal use, but in a European Court of Justice ruling (in 2007 I think) sending them by post (i.e. via an agency) was banned, i.e. you would be liable for VAT &amp; duty in the destination country.   Most of the considerations in that ruling were in relation to companies in Latvia posting ciggarettes at E1 per pack into the rest of the E.U.<br /><br />The stuff can still be sent but you have to take a chance, and you do have the right to accept the delivery and pay the outstanding amount.  I've never had any problems, because I think the internal E.U. stuff is gone over by dogs for illegal drugs as opposed to other stuff.  Example:  Olive oils from the continent are half the price they are here and a bottle in a parcel could be anything and there are tens of thousands every day.<br /><br />The sending of liquids outside the E.U. is prohibited by An Post and I've had to fib my way around them sending samples to Norway and the U.S.<br /><br /><br />P.S. Can I ask which E.U. country the confiscated bottle was from???</div>
