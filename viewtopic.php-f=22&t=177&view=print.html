				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />They were all bottled full size as well as in minature (i think a number of the full size bottles may actually have been re-bottled as minatures ?? in order to sell them . I currently have the 3 Tullamore bottlings 38, 41 and 42, the Bow Street and the Bushmills 14YO but not the other three - two of which i have only ever seen in minature - Jones Road and Royal Irish and the other not at all.  I prefer them with their original Cadenhead green labels but I kniw a few Tullamores and Bow Streets were subsequently re-labelled as they had deteriorated in storage. They are all shown as full size in jim Murray's first book (1994) but neither the nice helpful folks at Cadenheads nor Jim was able to tell me how many bottles there were of each. I know some of them were amazingly expensive at the time of bottling/ sale.<br /><br />On the 38YO it is actually not part of the 150th anniversary bottlings - i forget tyhe year off the top of my head. In the second edition of Jim Murray's book he mentions only 1 remaining full size 38YO bottle - at that time - but I don't know how many there were to begin with.<br /><br />beeandvee88</div>

				<div class="content">Your man Serge Valatin <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.whiskyfun.com">www.whiskyfun.com</a><!-- w --> has tasted the Royal Irish one. He rates it very low, but he'd rarely give an Irish whiskey a good rating. <br /><br />I have a few things from Cadenhead that indicates the number of miniatures produced, but that's all. <br /><br />A bit off the point, but Cooley have a few vats of whiskeys from Powers and Jameson in their warehouses in Louth. It will be interesting to see what they do with them. <br /><br />Some are destroyed with age, some are under strength, while others are supposed to be quite good. <br />John</div>

				<div class="content">This looks pretty comprehensive. I had never heard of there being two different Bow Streets - 26 and 27 YO??<br /><br />I am assuming your numbers after the description of the year is the number of bottles ?? - how did you come by this information?<br /><br />For example on the Tullamore 38YO you mention only 1 bottle - I actually have such a bottle but can't believe it is the only 1 or there was only 1 bottled although I do know cadenheads did turn to minatures as they were struggling to sell the full size bottlings. I think I recall one of them in Cadenheads with a retail price of something like £2,950 and that was in 1993!!!<br /><br />beeandvee88</div>

				<div class="content">Have you any photo's of these extra bottles? I know you are very thorough in researching these but I would always be slightly suspicious of online data unless I saw photographic evidence to coroborate. Also there are very plausable grounds for typo's to lead us astray too. <br /><br />Take the Bow Street &amp; one of the Tullamores for instance. As most of you know some of these were relabeled but I'm not sure if the distilation year was put on the new labels but just the age and re bottled as Bond Reserve.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

		</div><br /><br />So it would be nice to be able to state the above true with out any doubt.<br /><br />The 2 Bushmills looks like they different enough to be correct but the 2 Bow Street's could just as easily be misinterpretations by online sites. <br /><br />There are many anomalies ... I have the Bow Street both Green and white labels as 68.2% you have it as 68.1% <br />Bushmills 14yo I have as bottled in 1992 you have 1991. I think my info is correct by the way  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I had the Bushmills down as 60.9 but you had 60.6 which is the correct abv according to photos  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> .<br /><br />Also I notice several ABV's for 2 of the tullamore's. Where have these come from? If these come from mini's they should not be associated with full bottles and should be in a category of their own and totally seperate as that will ultimately cause confusion. If not there is either 3 versions of each which would be very exciting news.<br /><br />I have made many assumptions or used online info which was incorrect and I know that I probably still have a few errors on my site but with time and us coming together we will eventually get a full and comprehensive list.<br /><br />Nice list by the way you obviously spent a lot of time researching it <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
