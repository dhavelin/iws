				<div class="content">Thought that couldn't be right until i saw Teeling on the bottle<br />as C/Kavanagh I saw as being West Cork Distillers brand. I saw<br />things going legal over less as this name is spelled by Irish people<br />in both ways. I concede the labels are very different. I recall though<br />West Cork were selling this brand in the U.S. as well as I saw their label <br />on a U.S. drink website def. not a Russian site.</div>

I attach a screen grab of the relevant page.<br />Also attached details of the K Kern Irish Whiskey trademark...The trademark being assigned to International Distillers and Vintners Ltd.<br />BTW there is also a Kavanagh Irish Cream ,produced by Terra in Co.Cavan. Perhaps not surprising as they bottle for Teelings <div class="inline-attachment">

Cavanagh’s, handcrafted in West Cork, Ireland, is infused with Irish and Bourbon cask oak using a proprietary infusion process.<br /><br />It is then steeped in malt through an ancient artisan and near-forgotten technique. The resurrection of this lost steeping process insures to marry a smooth and clean finish whilst retaining a vibrant and distinctive character.<br /><br />Cavanagh’s is inspired by the Irish love of good company and lasting friendship.&quot;<br /><br />Is that's whiskey?

				<div class="content">I know we're off topic here but I would love to read howtodrinkwhisky.com 's review of Pogue whiskey. <br /><br />This is an excellent description of McFadden Irish stuff. <br />&quot;This stuff is creepy. I took my first sip and woke up shoeless on a park bench 20 minutes later with a raging case of pinkeye and no recollection of how I got there. If you’re looking for a passive-aggressive Secret Santa gift for that whisky-drinking loudmouth you work with, this is it.&quot;</div>

				<div class="content">I think WCD have had an image issue and did not get out there to explain themselves very well. The reply was interesting and if they did that from day one they probably would not got half the flack as they receive on whiskey forums and blogs. At the end of the day clarity and opens works the best in this business especially when you have a highly knowledgeable fan base for the product.<br /><br />Anyway back to topic, my last 2 purchases were Powers for €21euro &amp; Paddy for €20. Ridiculous prices but I'm not complaining  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />We won't see these prices again as the under selling or below cost discounting of Alcohol is soon to be banned here. Stock up guys.<br /><br />Hard to believe but the Powers works out at <span style="font-weight: bold">€3.62</span> retail after taxes and Paddy <span style="font-weight: bold"> €2.88</span><br /><br />I'd love to know how much the Chains are losing on these ... and if the Distilleries are taking a hit too?</div>

				<div class="content">I'm told Aldi &amp; Lidl are launching those vouchers again, the spend €50+ get €10 off. If the likes of Tescos start accepting them again, I'll be having a field day. I recon I'm a net loss as a customer to them. I only ever buy spirits and fuel. <br /><br />I got a Jameson caskmates in Supervalu Enniscorthy for €38. That's not bad value I think.

Judging by the storm warnings, you'll need it. <br /><br />There's an topic called &quot;Bargain Buys (whiskey, whiskey books , etc)&quot; that's always worth checking. We found Three Swallow for €36 last week in Tescos. Great thing is they also accept the Lidl &amp; Aldi vouchers so this is often a real steal. They had vouchers last week with spend €100 get €20 off. I'm bankrupting them at this time of year. The papers cost €3. <br /><br />Supervalu has 3 Swallow for €40 &amp; Jameson Caskmates for €38 until the end of the year I'm told. Well it's only a few days away now. <br /><br />I'm off to Tesco for some plunder.<br /><br />That Nikka from the Barrel is great value. That better than most wholesalers.</div>
