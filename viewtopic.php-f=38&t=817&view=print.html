				<div class="content">Went to a beer festival thing at the Point last night, run by Deveney's of Dundrum. Anyway, it was very good and I think I saw a few society members there. Porterhouse guys were there, including Oliver Hughes. Asked a guy at the stand about the distillery and he said it's all going ahead and there would be further news shortly...</div>

				<div class="content">I had lots and lots! Had la Trappe, as it happens. Only a small measure. I'm not overly keen on the beers with high alcoholic strength. <br /><br />A pale ale from the Carlow Brewing Company was very nice, and I have a few very good Schneider Weiss. One made for the beer festival and one hopped wheat beer. <br /><br />Also an unfiltered beer from a company I can't remember and lots more - Porterhouse Imperial Stout...</div>

				<div class="content">The UK has a big Microbrew scene and up until the last 10 years beer was very much a local thing whether small or large brewerys depending on local population. Of course there were always a few nation wide drinks like we have here.<br /><br />Belguim has a huge density of local brewerys and I'm not sure if they are even into mass prduced beers that much. They are famed from their strong beers and of course the most famous of these are Trappist and Abbey beers. Seemingly in cities like Bruge they have certain pubs that have hundreds of Belguim beers to chose from. Germany to a lesser extent have local beers too but I have a feeling the Brewerys are bigger and cover bigger areas.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Malty<br /><br />I get the Helles any time I see it, but it's not often available. The Edelstoff is much more readily available over here, but I've only had it once or twice. <br /><br />The other day I bought a few bottles of the O'Hara's Irish Pale Ale, which I think is lovely. <br /><br />I never drank the Spaten much when I was in Munich, but now I love it and it's one of the easier ones to get over here. Very easy-drinking.</div>

				<div class="content">John,<br />Spaten has lost much of its attraction here since it was taken over by InBev. Unfortunately this takeover also included Franziskaner Weißbier  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /> <br />I also know a few who claim that since they took over and modified some of the processes, the beer has a tendency to cause upset stomachs and the runs.<br />Give me Augustiner or Hacker Pschorr anyday.<br /><br />Every year there are new rumours that InBev want to taken Spaten and Franziskaner away from Munich, but I'm sure Oktoberfest is one of the reasons they stay here as only the 6 central Munich breweries are allowed into the 'fest and it's a licence to print money.</div>

				<div class="content">I used to drink a lot of the Franziskaner too - the wheat beer. When I left Munich, I brought a case of it home in a cheap bag I bought by the side of the road. By the time I got home, the handles had broken and the zip had burst. But it was worth it. Now you can get it quite easily over here.<br /><br />A friend worked in Lowenbrau too and used to bring us back lots of it after work.<br /><br />I also love the Schneiderweiss (not sure of the spelling). Another favourite of mine. <br /><br />The Augustiner was sold in the huts on the factory floor during work time when I was employed at VAG in Munich.</div>

				<div class="content">There is a Munich by-law that says workers must have access to beer  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br />In fact, did you realise that beer in Bavaria has a lower rate of tax than anywhere else in Germany  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br />Yes, in Bavaria, beer is officially considered lebensmittel (essential or basic food) and is taxed as such.<br />This all means that most large Munich companies and factories allow their workers access to onsite beer, usually through vending machines on factory floors or actual taps in their canteens.<br />Where I used to work there were both, although the amount workers were allowed, or supposed, to drink was restricted in more recent times.<br /><br />I always thought it strange that in the self-service canteen there was a line of the usualy drinks; tea &amp; coffee machines, then coke, fanta, spezi .... etc ... then beer.</div>
