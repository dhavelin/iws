				<div class="content">With Auchentoshan it's the triple distillation thing.<br />Certainly, there is a very close resemblance between the Bush 16 and the Auchentoshan three wood, but that's to be expected given Auchentoshan blatantly copied the Bush whiskey!</div>

However I always found Bunny had a slightly different spice bite than Bushmills and of course the touch of smoke does not help to parallel them either but then I tend to revel in the Bushmills Sherry casks and are as good as some of the sherried speysiders and better than Macallan cask strength (imo) so it would be interesting to compare them. To be quite honest though I've never really thought about it too much.</div>
