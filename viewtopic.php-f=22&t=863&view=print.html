				<div class="content">Has anyone else tasted this. From what I understand it's a vatting of the Tyrconnell Sherry Port and Madeira finishes. All of which I really like.<br /><br />I tried this a few weeks ago and really didn't like it. I thought I'd give it another go. <br /><br />I really think something is not quite right with this. The nose I find slightly spirity with a vague hint of baby sick! Not good in a whiskey. Taste slightly metallic and a comfusion of port and sherry notes. The finish is very long but metallic and again a hint of baby sick. <br /><br />I just don't get it. To me this is a bit of a mess. <br /><br />And yet, as I said, I love the 3 component malts.</div>

				<div class="content">I suspect the bourbon refers to the fact the the sherry port and madeira were finishes so they were all matured in bourbon first.</div>

				<div class="content">Interesting but the bottom line is I really really don't like this. There's only 3 measures gone but I can't see myself ever pouring this again.<br /><br />Anyone like a bottle with 17 measures left?</div>

				<div class="content">Undecided myself on this one, don't know if it quite sits together at 40%, they could try 46% or perhaps a longer vatting period or possibly recasked and married for an appropriate period.... but yes your probably right</div>

				<div class="content">I'm really interested in people's views on this one - there's very few Irish whiskeys where I go NO! I think you're right - it just doesn't sit right - maybe longer marrying or something but to me the blending on this just isn't right. Of course it may evolve over time. This time next year there may be Glenfiddich in it! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">I quite like this. A soft whiskey with a pretty long but gentle finish. There's something very slightly odd about it, but I like this. I'm actually tasting a little bit now to make sure, so I'll be leaving my fighter jet in the hangar until lunchtime.</div>

				<div class="content">But I'd have to pay income tax or capital gains tax if it wasn't a hobby, and I like to turn over a jet (figuratively and physically) once a week. <br /><br />Speaking of Tullamore, Grants are opening an office in Dublin... Any more 'news' about a possible distillery?<br /><br />Passed the Bulmers place recently. There's a lovely drive from Clonmel up to Kilkenny - the long way. Might be a nice place for a distillery.</div>
