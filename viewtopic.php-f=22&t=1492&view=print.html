Acording to my book written by M. Jackson it was not unusally with oat and rye in the mash. Is it needed? Is it allowed?<br /><br />/Uffe</div>

				<div class="content">hey there Uffe and welcome to the forum--<br /><br />Michael Jackson's description about the oats and rye is primarily a historical one. Today its a pretty clean sweep of mixtures solely between malted and unmalted barley. The ratio can varie but it tends to be around 40/60. In the past, small amounts of oats in particular were included in the &quot;unmalted&quot; side of that partnership (and this has been resurrected in modern times by the kilbeggan distillery's plans for SPS). The problem with oats is that they form a bit of a porridge like wash that in former times could cause the stills to blow.</div>

				<div class="content">What about triple destilling as it's tolled at the singelpotstill-page. To be honest they say triple destilled as it's done at Midleton but  is it okej with just twice? Does it always come out at such high alcohol (90%-92%)?</div>

				<div class="content">triple distillation has long been a very very common feature of SPS whiskey for a variety of reasons but no, despite what IDL tell you, it wasnt always universal. Monasterevin distillery out in Kildare used to double distill their pot still whiskey and Cooley have revived the practice recently</div>

				<div class="content">as for the high alcohol, thats the natural result of tripple distillation. the same would be true of a tripple distilled single malt whiskey like bushmills or auchentoshan over in scotland. every time you distill something you bring it that much closer to neutral alcohol.</div>
