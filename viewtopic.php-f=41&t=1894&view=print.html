				<div class="content">Thanks, a look at the seal and base are useful too, but so far I see no reason to change my estimation.<br /><br /><br />Though now that I've thought about it a bit more the neck label could push it back to the 40s.  Was there a third label on the bottom that fell off?</div>

				<div class="content">It looks like a 60's bottle okay. Pity the capsule is gone. I assume there was a wooden stopper attached to the cork but it's gone too.  I can't see it but I'm using the zoom on my phone. <br /><br />With all labels and capsule intact it would be worth considerably more. Without I couldn't say. <br /><br />It would be great for a tasting.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes Image quality is a major issue here.<br /><br />What are you using to take the pictures, camera or Phone?<br /><br />Also the light condition are affecting them also.<br /><br />Best advise for taking close ups is to do so in natural light (day light) and dont have the camera closer than 3 feet to the object. This give the camera better opportunity to focus.<br /><br />If it is a case that you are reducing the size of the photos to put up here you can send them to me and I'll put them up for you. PM me and I'll let you know my email.<br /><br />Cheers</div>

				<div class="content">Late 60's I reckon by label. Glass bottle is older which would<br />be usual as they recycled them for years . It was'nt this generation<br />that invented recycling as glass was an expensive commodity.</div>
