Well worth going to though, try and make it before noon as if they are distilling that is when they will be doing it. So ring ahead for times of the tours. <br /><br />Tullamore is only an interpretation centre so any time is fine there.<br /><br />By the way Tullamore and Kilbeggan are only about 10mins apart by car.<br /><br />The other option is that you could stay in Athlone which is only 20mins down the motor way and is a much bigger town with at least 2 nice hotels that I know about. The Price of Wales slap bang in the centre of the town and the Hodson Bay hotel with is possibly a 5star so maybe a bit on the expensive side. But again Athlone will have much more than that to offer and better shopping, bars and more places to eat but don't ask me for recommendation on that either  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>
