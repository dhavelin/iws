I know the Logrow CV contains whisky aged 6-14 years from sherry, port, bourbon, and rum casks. I assume it's similar with the other two.<br /> <br /> <br />edit: They're all 46%.</div>

				<div class="content">After I started on my first bottle of Bushmills Black Bush last week, I told myself that it is so good, there is really no need to try any more Irish<br />Whiskies! On Friday, I found the 16 year on sale at the liquor store. It is normally $88.00CAD here in BC, but was discounted about $14.00.<br />My next find was a bottle of Bushmills 1608 400 year Anniversary edition. It was $115.00. Prices are high here - taxes etc. - but you get what you pay for. At least, I can get nearly all of the whiskies that I really want. I am itching to try the 1608, but also think I might want to save it for a while, although I am not usually one for saving things for special occasions. After all, what occasion is better than this moment? I tell myself that, yet I will probably hold off for a while longer. The 16 year is fantastic. Bit harsher than what I would have thought. The 3 cask thing is very interesting: Bourbon, Sherry, and a Port Wine finish. I actually do detect the Port Wine on the finish of this dram, and think that it will be exceptional with a good chunk of Stilton cheese!<br /><br /><img src="http://i492.photobucket.com/albums/rr286/carlhaluss/Bushmills1608.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://i492.photobucket.com/albums/rr286/carlhaluss/Bushmills16year.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="http://i492.photobucket.com/albums/rr286/carlhaluss/Stilton.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Out for brunch today, I tried a couple of glasses of Bowmore 12 year old, a Scotch malt whisky which I never had before. I think that I may be getting a bottle of that very soon. A very pleasant surprise for me. More like an Irish Whisky to me than the other Scotch single malts I have tried, in that it doesn't finish off with the lingering sweetness which I often find a bit much after a few glasses. Like an Irish Whiskey I feel that I could go on and on drinking the Bowmore.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Carl</div>

I remember tasting it blind once and being surprised how much I liked it, because I always thought I didn't like it...</div>

				<div class="content">Today's weekend purchase is a Bowmore 12 year. I tasted it last week, at a local bar, and liked it a lot. Definitely Islay, with the smokey peat. Just enough to make it interesting, without being too peaty or smokey. And it doesn't have a lingering sweetness like so many of the sherry casks. It also has a bit of a bite, or harshness - and I mean that in a very good way - which turns into a nice warm finish. It actually seems to me like a bit younger one, say a 10 year, would be. And that's not a bad thing either. I find as I get more acquainted with the Irish and Scotch whiskies, that I am preferring the younger ones.<br />My first Bowmore tasting was at a local restaurant, where I was offered an 18 year old at New Year's. It did not appeal at all. So I was reluctant to try the 12 year last week, but that turned out to be a pleasant surprise.<br />Funny how sometimes you think that by spending more money on an older whiskey, it will be more appealing. And you would think that a less expensive, younger one would not be so enjoyable. I am finding in most cases that it works the other way. There are a couple of the more expensive ones, in particular the Oban 14 year and the Lagavulin 16 year that I will eventually try - they cost $114.00 and $125.00 respectively, in Canadian funds - but I am in no real hurry, and for the most part will try to stay around a maximum $60.00 bottle. The Bowmore 12 year is exactly 60 bucks here. There are doubtless exceptions, like the Laphroaig Quarter Cask at almost $80.00, but that is in a league of it's own.<br />Cheers,<br />Carl</div>

And from my limited experience of PX the influence is very strong - lots of raisin on the nose and taste - again in a good way. It takes a few goes to get the head around this but definitely worth a go in my book. <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
