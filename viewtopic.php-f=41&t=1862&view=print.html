				<div class="content">1960's to 1970's sounds right to me. Price is ridiculous !!!<br />If you want to try some cheap John's Lane whiskey then some<br />of the Tullamore Whiskey crocks which are often on WhiskeyAuction<br />were distilled in John's Lane before the move to Midleton !</div>

				<div class="content">Agreed on the price, just trying to figure out when it is from.  It looks identical to the Pot Still labels, with a few subtle changes.  I wonder if that was how the Pot Still was sold in some markets?  I know the Pot Still label in the USA said Irish Whiskey in big letters in the middle of the big label instead of Dublin Whiskey in the domestic market.</div>

				<div class="content">I think, thanks to the Italian tax strip it can be dated to the early '70s.  This isn't gospel, but I'm fairly confident.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree it's  late 60's or early 70's. I've a pot still one from the mid 60's. They decided to go the blended route around then and went in with Jameson and Cork. <br />The last of the whiskey from John's Lane was blended. I don't have that style but have the ones just after. <br />I'll dig out a photo if them. <br />I wouldn't pay any more than €100 but I'm gone frugal lately.</div>

				<div class="content">If you see one for 100 euro, let me know!<br /><br />These used to sell for over 500 euro in the Celtic Whiskey Shop, but times have changed now. The pot still ones are more desirable.</div>

				<div class="content">Here's a photo of my 3 from John's lane. <br />The first is Blended and called Dublin Whiskey<br />Next is the Pot Still version and also called Dublin Whiskey. Both have corks.<br />Finally the one on the right is also from John's Lane Distillery but with a screw cap.<br /><br />I think I've one that say Smithfield Dublin instead of John's lane too.<br /><br />If anyone want to give me €500 each I gladly take their arm too <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">That's a nice set.  I had a mini of the Dublin blend, very good and have two of the PPS.  I was wondering if the 7 year old was PPS, but labeled differently for Italy, but it is too late to be a PPS.  I had a line on one for a not bad price, but I'm not interested now that I know it isn't PPS.  It is probably quite good, but not worth the money for me.  The price at the link I used above is impressive, I have a feeling someone forgot to take their medication when coming up with that price.  Just think how many cases of John's Lane that would be...</div>

				<div class="content">The price is just mental. By that calculation the Pot Still would probably be worth a couple of grand.<br /><br />I wonder do they buy them too?<br /><br />I noticed Ally has some older Powers too and looking for €250 for a 40oz bottle from John's lane.</div>
