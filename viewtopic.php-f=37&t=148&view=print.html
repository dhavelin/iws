				<div class="date"><img src="styles/iws/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Tue Jun 09, 2009 6:20 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Some people may be aware that the Irish Whiskey Society is teaming up with the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland and the Heritage Boat Association to bottle its first cask later this year.<br />The bottling, known as the 'Grand Crew', will make history later this Summer when it is brought down the Grand Canal from the distillery at Kilbeggan to Dublin, the first time whiskey has been transported by boat down the canal in over half a century.<br />IWS member and IWAI member Michael Slevin is the man who has been at the fulcrum of the project and brought all the elements together to make this happen. And so it was fitting that when it came time to decide on a cask to bottle, the tasting committee gathered in his home to do so.<br />On behalf of the Society, six of the board gathered at the home of Michael Slevin to assess six different casks from Cooley with a view to bottling one as the 'Grand Crew' bottling specially selected by the Irish Whiskey Society.<br />The nosing and tasting was conducted blind, but tasters were aware that there were three 8 year old casks and 3 9 year old casks.<br />It quickly became evident that the first three casks were the younger three. After tasting was complete, it was revealed that the casks were in chronological order of distillation and in fact were almost consecutive casks in Cooley's warehouse.<br />The casks were:<br />(1) K01/1 no. 57, an 8yo<br />(2) K01/1 no. 60, an 8yo<br />(3) K01/1 no. 61, an 8yo<br />(4) K00/6 no. 696 - 9yo<br />(5) K00/6 no. 697 - 9yo<br />(6) K00/6 no. 700 - 9yo<br />As Michael Slevin has noted, despite this near sequentiality, there was significant variety among the samples.<br />They were nosed firstly at 20% and then again at 40%, before being tasted at c. 40-50% and again at cask strength.<br />A consensus soon developed that three were superior to the remainder. These three were:<br />(3) K01/1 no. 61<br />(4) K00/6 no. 696<br />(6) K00/6 no. 700<br /><br />Nosing at 20%:<br />Sample (1) showed some typical Tyrconnell fruitiness, a little green apple and sweetness but was otherwise sugary and fiery on the nose.<br />Sample (2) appeared to be quite bland, indicating some pear and grapeskin on the nose.<br />Sample (3) offered vanilla pod, some pepperiness, as well as the light fruitiness familiar from Tyrconnell.<br />Sample (4) had a fascinating nose, quite floral with hints of peach, apricot and lemongrass, as well as some grassiness.<br />Sample (5) was somewhat maltier than others, offering grain and some grass on the nose.<br />Sample (6) was complex on the nose, offering some citrus notes, leafiness and fruity acetic acid.<br /><br />Nosing at 40% largely confirmed the above opinions, with the three favoured samples offering up some further top notes.<br />Sample (3) offered more citrus and grain at 40%, while sample (4) offered bananas and cut pear, and sample (6) offered some leather.<br /><br />Tasting was conducted in two formal rounds at different strengths. In the first round, tasting was conducted at between 40% and 50% proof depending on taster's preference. A second round of tasting was conducted at between 50% and cask strength again dependent on taster's preference.<br />Despite three clear favourites from the nosing, we tasted all six samples carefully. However, the same three samples came to the fore.<br />Sample (1) was fruity, apply and very fiery, certainly too young and rough to bottle.<br />Sample (2) was oilier and grassier, somewhat more rounded but still young and unremarkable.<br />Sample (3) was pleasant, light and balanced, with good fruit and an impactful lengthy finish<br />Sample (4) offered an interesting if somewhat unbalanced array of exotic fruits, peaches, apricots, dried pear, almonds, grassiness and some malt. While fascinating, it did die somewhat quickly on the finish, however.<br />Sample (5) came across quite citric, with some mild malt and another shortened finish.<br />Sample (6) offered some pepper, apple pie, nuts and pear drops as well as a pleasant oiliness and a malty finish.<br /><br />Debate soon centred upon the two older preferred samples, (4) and (6), casks 696 and 700 respectively. Both had their fans and all agreed that these two samples were the best two in the entire range we had received.<br />At this point, the six tasters present consulted with Adrian Phelan by telephone. Adrian had come to remarkably similar conclusions on his own, having considered all of the samples alone on a previous date.<br />After votes were cast, there was a very marginal preference for the somewhat unusual sample (4) – cask 696, over the more conventional sample (6) – cask 700.<br />Therefore, after nearly four hours of tasting, it was decided by the most narrow of margins to bottle cask number 696 as the 'Grand Crew' bottling, the first ever whiskey specially selected by the Irish Whiskey Society.<br />Limited numbers of bottles of this 'Grand Crew' will be available for purchase by IWS members later in the year.</div>

(That is to say the mills of God grind slowly but finely, i.e. the society was a long time coming but it was inevitable).  <br /><br />I thought the mechanical tones of the seanfhocal suited this astonishing news.  How quickly the cogs and so on have moved to bring us to this point!  I must say my congratulations to all the members and organisers who have worked so hard for this and I look forward to getting a bottle of this when it becomes available.</div>

				<div class="content">I hope it wasn't too mechanical, Cathach!<br />I justed wanted to convey the fact that this was done extremely methodically and thoroughly. No cask was ever chosen with more care or attention, I suspect!<br />From what I recall, it's a fascinating wee dram that will reward tipplers who get to try it, and has a little bit more going on than your average Tyrconnell.<br />We're still a long way back from bottling, selling or tasting at this time, but all of that will come to pass in the next few months, and I thought it would be valuable to share with the members what stage in the process things had reached.</div>

				<div class="content">A thorough, controlled process, conducted in a formal fashion and properly validated. I'm sure it was a pleasure to be involved but still an important and pressure-filled job - given that the Society's name will be on the eventual bottle. Well done to all involved and many thanks for work done to date. Looking forward to tasting the premier release!<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">I was lucky enough to have a taste too but was not as clinical in my methods.<br /><br />It was very obvious that all these were from the Tyrconell side of the warehouse so I ignored the Tyrconnell fruitiness that was evident in them in one degree or another.<br /><br />Eventhough I had the exact same first and second as the tenacious taste team I had actually dismissed 1-3 and I found them much lighter than 4-6. I was also tasting at cask strength and touched them with water after a while. SO slightly different from the main crew. <br /><br />I placed No 4 first with No 6 second.<br /><br />Sample No 4 <br /><br />A wonderfully more heavier nose that any the 3 previous. Malt enveloped by sweet floral notes (but not perfumed) and followed by muted dry grass.<br /><br />Quite oily and thick on the palate with some lovely fresh fruits (mango etc).<br /><br />Followed by Big wood spice burst at the end (Probably the pepper Brian Quinn mentions)<br /><br /><br />Sample No 6. <br /><br />This had the heaviest malt nose for me with nut and plenty of fruit with a slightly fruity vinegar in the back ground. <br /><br />Probably out of them all this had the most obvious Tyrconnell fruitiness on the taste. Then a welcome sour note balancing the sweet fruit</div>

				<div class="content">OK, we've progressed the project a fair bit.  <br />As above, this is a joint effort with the <a href="http://www.iwai.ie" class="postlink">Inland Waterways Association of Ireland</a> and the <a href="http://www.heritageboatassociation.ie" class="postlink">Heritage Boat Association</a>.  Cooley have been very supportive of this bottling as it marks a significant event in the life of the Irish Inland Waterways, namely the 50th anniversary of the withdrawal of the commercial canal boats by CIE in 1959.  Given the importance of the canal system to the success of Locke's Distillery in the 2nd half of the 19th century, it is natural that Cooley would support this venture.  Nonetheless, we thank them for all the assistance given us to date.  Andrew Bielenberg's book &quot;Locke's Distillery, A History&quot; is recommended reading.<br /><br />For more information on the background, the rationale and indeed the whiskey, please see <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://grandcrew.iwai.ie/" class="postlink">http://grandcrew.iwai.ie/</a></span>  <br />We're looking forward to getting the cask to Dublin and sampling the contents (again).<br />Michael<br /><br />Again, more information at <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://grandcrew.iwai.ie/" class="postlink">http://grandcrew.iwai.ie/</a></span>  <br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Fellow members.<br />We are naturally invited to participate in the shipping of the casks from Kilbeggan to Ballycommon on Saturday 29th August.  Not sure what form this might take - however we might have responsibility for defending the casks for a mile or so of its 8-mile journey from Kilbeggan to Balllycommon.  Alternatively, we might of course decide that these boaty types don't deserve to keep any of this whiskey and launch an ambush.    Alternatively (again), if someone had access to a suitable vintage truck, we might take responsibility for the 1st mile of the journey from the distillery to Kilbeggan Harbour by road.<br /><br />If anyone would like to participate in any shenanigans on the day or especially has access to a suitable vintage vehicle, give us a shout off-list to grandcrew AT irishwhiskeysociety.com<br />/Michael</div>
