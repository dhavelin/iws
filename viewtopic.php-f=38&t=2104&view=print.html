				<div class="content">I'm new and not sure I'm doing this correctly or if we're allowed to make this type of request.<br />We live in Canada and went to Ireland to get married in 1985. Years later we went to Dublin for 10 days for my wife's 50th Birthday. While we were there we bought the Jameson's Marconi 100th Anniversary Irish Whiskey and Bev just loved it. Had I known it then, I would have purchased multiple bottles. Needless to say, our bottle is long, long gone. We are going to Dublin in March for St. Paddy's and Bev's 60th Birthday. I would really like to get her a bottle of this whiskey for her Birthday so if anyone has one and would consider selling it, please let me know! You can email me at:   <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Liamsplace@shaw.ca">Liamsplace@shaw.ca</a><!-- e --><br />Thanks in advance if you or anyone you know can help me,<br />Bill</div>
