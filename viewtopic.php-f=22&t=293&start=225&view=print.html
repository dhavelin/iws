				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   I just purchased another (what I consider) the &quot;best bargain&quot; Irish Whiskey (as well as the lowest priced) Irish Whiskey sold in the State of Maine, KILBEGGAN Irish Whiskey.  I plan to set aside a few more bottles of (OLD label) Kilbeggan while the getting is good.  It is my understanding that NEW label Kilbeggan Whiskey is totally different (read sub par) compared to the OLD label Kilbeggan .<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there, <br /><br />Sixcats, to be fair you should reserve judgement until you have tasted them side by side, I wouldn't be basing my purchasing decisions on one review.<br />It wouldn't be the first time that initial impressions were incorrect. I'll be waiting till I can taste both side by side and a few other reviews have come in. We don't even know yet if the blend has actually changed for sure (it is possible that it hasn't). Will be asking Cooley next opportunity I get,<br /><br />In the meantime happy hunting...</div>

				<div class="content">Hi WB,<br /><br />    I have to admit WB, you make a very good point.  I SHOULD know better than to be influenced by a single negative review regardless of how well it was written.  Heck, if I had listen to all the negative comments regarding the current OLD label Kilbeggan, I never would of tried this wonderful budget Whiskey.  I SHOULD know by now that everybody has different taste.  Heck, I might even prefer the NEW label Kilbeggan Whiskey so, point well taken.  Well, I guess I'll just have to Pony up the money when NEW label Kilbeggan is available and do the only fair thing.....have a side by side taste test.  It's a dangerous job but, somebody's got to do it!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">No, that was an adequate response. I kind of think the same. <br /><br />I'd like to try it. It's not really designed for the home market, but good luck to him if he sells it. <br /><br />Any new Irish whiskeys on the horizon?</div>

				<div class="content">There's been a wave of recent anouncements regarding Cooley's longer-aged releases; the Tullamore outlook looks good and the recent announcement from IDL relating to their wish to increase capacity at Midleton all bode very well in terms of what the consumer can expect in the medium term. Aside from those I can't really add anything else. Bushmills must surely be on the cusp of a press release of some description - it's eerily quiet up there! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Just bought the below list last week, I have been saving all summer so that I can buy in bulk - better value that way with delivery cost.<br /><br />Looking forward to delivery - I will be buying again at Christmas and I am looking for a few Irish whiskies to replace buying blends.<br /><br /><br />Whisky<br /><br />3 x Laphroaig 10YO CS Batch 02 <br />1x Lagavulin 16YO<br />1 x Caol Ila 12 YO <br />1 x Caol Ila CS <br />2 x Ardbeg 10 YO <br />1 x Ardbeg Uigeadail<br />1 x Balblair '97 <br />2 xTalisker 10 YO <br />1x Black Bottle<br />1x Johnnie Walker Black Label<br /><br /> <br />Bourbon<br />1x George T Stagg '09 (birthday present)  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /> Rum<br />2 x Appleton 12 YO <br /><br />On a side note, i always buy from the UK as its much cheaper but was in Cork today (as the missus was doing the mini marathon) and dropped into a certain off-license on Oliver Plunkett street and they were charging a crazy €64 for a standard 10 YO Laphroiag and €64 for 10 YO Talisker  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />I was in Killarney a few weeks back, bringing the young one to see Jedward, thought I would drop into Tesco on the way home - lucky I did - they had 2 bottles of 10 YO Laphroaig sitting on the shelf 'reduced to clear' - €15 each  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />I swooped them up and asked the guy working in the booze section if there was anymore - he told me that they only ever had 2 and they have been sitting there for the last 3-4 years or so. Couldnt believe it. Even the bottle caps were a different colour and the little leaflet inside was different.<br />I contacted Laphroaig direct as there was no pin number to earn my points and when I explained the bottle she laughed and said she hasnt seen one of them for a long time but she gave me the points anyway. <br />Seriously couldnt believe it - €15 on a lucky days shopping versus todays shock at €64 in Cork city.<br /><br />By the way, there is a bottle of Connemara in Super Value that I have being eyeing up for the last 2 or 3 weeks - €31 - not sure to go for it as I am fairly broke from my last order - my gut is telling me to wait for the Turf Mor.</div>
