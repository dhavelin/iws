				<div class="content">Best of luck with that. I hope you get to go.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>IrishWhiskeyChaser wrote:</cite>Why can't they just pick a name out of a hat any more ????</div></blockquote><br />I was idly speculating about Bushmills' marketing strategy recently. I reckon they want people to imagine being at the distillery where the whiskey is made. That's why this is the third year in a row they have had a competition to visit the distillery and you have to jump through some hoops to show your enthusiasm for getting there.<br /><br />Being able to visit the distillery distinguishes them from Jameson. The strategy makes sense, I think, even though it deters me from entering.</div>

If I had known it was a facebook voting thingy I would of stayed well clear. Bloody hell I have well under 100 facebook &quot;friends&quot; and I probably could cut those in half as the other half are industry people. Then I know people with hundreds of FB friends ... basically I haven't a hope but what can you do ... They might send me a bottle of Bushmills White for coming last  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>
