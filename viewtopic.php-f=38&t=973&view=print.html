				<div class="content">This is the  final stage  in making the  pure spirits <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">for</span></span> vodka, gin or other flavoured  drinks. <br /><br />The reasoni havent started the  next batch of IRISH STYLE WHISKEY is that  my partner in crime is on a  mini vacation to destin beach in florida. He will return next week and then we will go to the city for grains. I hope he stays put for a few days lol<br /><br />Meantime, i have  found a website for  vodka lovers. They had a list of simple infusions to make flavored  vodka.<br /><br /> I  hope to try the method as soon as  my alcohol comes off the carbon filtering.<br /><br />here is the list and  method.<br /><br />Flavored Vodka<br />Properly flavored vodkas are a treat either alone or to complement part of a meal: A cool vanilla vodka to accompany an after-dinner coffee ... apricot vodka with a fruit trifle ... cherry vodka with a piece of chocolate cake ... the opportunities are endless! <br /><br />The following flavored vodkas are simple to prepare at home. After infusing, keep them in the freezer for best results. [These recipes are taken from A Taste of Russia, published by Russian Life.<br /> (((((<span style="font-weight: bold"> I DONT UNDERSTAND THIS PART ABOUT THE FREEZER??  ANY THOUGHTS</span>))))<br />Anise Vodka/Anisovaya: Place 2 teaspoons whole anise seed in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain. [Note: Peter the Great's favorite drink was triple-filtered vodka, diluted with anise water, then redistilled.]<br /><br />Apricot Vodka/Abrikosovaya: Place one dozen apricot kernels in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain.<br /><br />Black-Currant-Bud Vodka/Smorodinovka: Pick the buds of black currants when they are still sticky. Place a handful in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain. An alternative method is to make a very strong infusion in only 1/4 pint of vodka and then add 10 to 12 drops of the essence to a bottle of plain vodka.<br /><br />Cherry Vodka/Vishnyovka: Crush 36 cherry pits and place them in 1 pint of plain vodka. Infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain.<br /><br />Coriander Vodka/Koriandrovaya: Place 2 teaspoons of coriander seed, slightly crushed, in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain.<br /><br />Garlic-and-Dill Vodka/Chesnochnaya: Place 1 clove of garlic, slightly crushed, 1 sprig of fresh dill and 3 white peppercorns in 1 pint of plain vodka. Infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain. A small bit of dill may be left in the vodka, if desired.<br /><br />Herb Vodka/Travnik: Place a few sprigs of a favorite herb, such as tarragon or basil, in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain. A small bit of the herb may be left in the vodka.<br /><br />Lemon or OrangeVodka/Limonovka or Oranzhevaya: Remove the rind from 1/2 large lemon or from 1 orange in a single strip, taking care to avoid the bitter white pith. Infuse in 1 pint of plain vodka at room temperature for 24 hours. (Do not leave the peel in longer, or the vodka will turn bitter.)<br /><br />Pepper Vodka/Pertsovka: Place 30 black peppercorns and 30 white peppercorns in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain.<br /><br />Saffron Vodka/Shafrannaya: Place 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain.<br /><br />Tea Vodka/Chainaya: Place 4 teaspoons black tea leaves, preferably fruit-scented, in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain.<br /><br />Buffalo Grass Vodka/Zubrovka: Place 8 blades of buffalo grass in 1 pint of plain vodka and infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. One blade of grass may be left in the vodka after straining.<br /><br /> I hope someone finds this usefull <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'm setting up to make a 7 gallon batch of  wash for vodka. I make the wash from sugar.<br /> I just wanted anyone interested to see how  much stuff i use to make the batch.<br /><br />Making whiskey is  much more work and requires large pots to  mash and strain the  liquid off the grain. <br /> Whiskey is an time consuming job just for one batch. one of  my 7 gallon/25 liter batches produces about 3 liters of drinkable and one liter of liquid that will be added to  the  next batch for re distilling. I dont carbon filter whiskey becaus the tripple distill removes enough congeners  but still leaves  the necessary flavour.<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/special%20%20hobby%20tools/settingup001-1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/special%20%20hobby%20tools/settingup002-1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /> My camera seems to be  dying.</div>

				<div class="content">Due to having learned that fermenting at cooler temperatures produces better quality product, I have postponed my Irish style whiskey project untill next october or so. It hot in florida and i keep my Aor conditioner at 78 defrees F (( 25.5 C)<br /><br />ideally i need 65 degrees F (( 18.3 C )) so ill have to wait for next winter to get pictures of the process on  the forum.<br /><br /><br />However i have  just enrolled in a class that will be  doing an all grain brewing for  beer. I will take lots of pictures ((march 20 or so)) And post them.<br /><br /> The process for all grain beer is  basically the same as for  mashing grain for  whiskey.<br /><br />Sorry i didnt keep my promise to brew some Irish style whiskey this season.</div>
