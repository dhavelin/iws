				<div class="content">One of our members tweeted about a talk at the Offaly History society tomorrow. I can't seem to find a good link for it but it's on the front page of their website at the moment:<br /><br />  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.offalyhistory.com/">http://www.offalyhistory.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What occurs to me, anyway, is that we might invite the gentleman to Dublin to talk about his thesis to the society. We could charge a few euros per head to put him up in Brooks for the night. This would be an evening without whiskey - just a talk - so we get to hear as much as possible, see the slides, and have time for Q&amp;A.<br /><br />The idea of having a series of distilling-related talks also appeals to me.<br /><br />Would anyone else be interested in such an evening?</div>

				<div class="content">Perhaps the market for a &quot;dry&quot; talk is not as big as I hoped.<br /><br />Ideally, the IWS would agree to underwrite expenses before I start booking people and venues. I'd like to get somewhere with raked seating and a good screen. Like the Science Gallery, for example. I wonder if that would be available for free... it would encourage attendance and limit hassle if we didn't have to deal with money.<br /><br />Do ye know of any other venues that fit the bill?</div>

				<div class="content">I would think that it would be a positive expansion of the society to have such talks and events and would think it important to advance the society as a &quot;whiskey knowledge base&quot;.<br /><br />Having attended the aforementioned lecture, I thought it to be very informative and gave a great snap view of the great distilling era that once was in the Kildare and surrounding area (east midlands).<br /><br />At the outset, to garner interest perhaps couple the talk / lecture with a tasting or similar could be an idea - but be sure, listening to lecture on whiskey will make you thirsty by the end anyway!!</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>COG wrote:</cite>At the outset, to garner interest perhaps couple the talk / lecture with a tasting or similar could be an idea...</div></blockquote><br /><br />It's a nice thought but it can only come at the expense of the presentation because of the requirement that spirits must be served in a venue with a spirits licence. Half the attendees in our current room are facing away from the screen, the bottom of the screen is hard to see for everyone and the edges of the slides get clipped by the projector.<br /><br />I do think we could have an educational role, distinct from the quaffing of whiskey. My feeling is that such talks will need to be free to attract an audience but would be a good ad for the society.</div>

				<div class="content">A full conference on Irish Whiskey will be held in the historic Port of Youghal<br />on the 29th./3oth. September next ( 9 to 10 lectures) programme is being<br />finalized at present. Members of IWS will recognize the names of a lot of the<br />speakers instantly. This is the 11th. annual conference of<span style="font-weight: bold"> 'Youghal Celebrates <br />History'</span> a local voluntary group of which I am part. Our website is www.<br />youghalcelebrateshistory.com and our brochure will be available in hardcopy<br />and in PDF . At the moment one can view details of our previous conferences and <br />speakers. In any event I will post a separate thread in approx. 1 month. So<br />like the character says in the Irish film 'The Run of the Country '  :<span style="font-weight: bold"> 'SAY NOTHING <br />TILL YOU HEAR MORE '</span> It is probable that a Tasting  night will be done on the<br />Friday night as well. In any event for Irish Whiskey buffs who also appreciate the<br />history aspects keep the dates free.</div>
