				<div class="content">I don't think I'm the only one here who occasionally mixes up different whiskeys to see how they would turn out. Most are rubbish to be honest. But I've been trying for a while to come up with a Cooley blend I like as much, say, as Black Bush or Jameson 12yo. I love Cooley malts and their single grain but the blends just don't do it for me. I think, though, I've finally cracked it. <br /><br />After much experimentation I've got the following mix (percentages reasonably accurate)<br /><br />(1) 55% Tyrconnell 15yo<br />(2) 30% Tyrconnell 10yo Sherry Finish<br />(3) 15% Greenone 15yo<br /><br />Leave to marry for a few minutes (if you smoke the time taken to pop outside is perfect).<br /><br />I know, I know, there's some good whiskey gone in there, so how could I really go wrong, but I like this one I've just made up my 3rd batch this week. (70ml at a time is all).<br /><br />Anyway, there you go.</div>

				<div class="content">Jameson 12 + Laphroaig Cairdeas 12yo circa 4:1 ... I actually was surprised how the Jameson dominated the blend with the Phroaig loosing most of it's charachteristics but giving this excellent islay edge to the entire project. HAlf and half you'd expect the Islay to dominate but I wonder ??? Probably would actually but the Jemmie 12 would totally soften it out I'd imagine.<br /><br />Can get a lot of salt on the nose though but the Jameson really holds it's own on taste with some beautiful and interesting phroaig edges and spice. Very interesting and something I must do with maybe Tyrconnell and Lap 10yo.<br /><br />What a fun thread ...</div>

				<div class="content">Interesting! I'm just thinking, as I read these posts, about the interaction of malt and PPS in a blend. If you forget about peat for the moment, which is something very distinctive, what is the effect of malt and PPS combined. Is it just like altering the mix of malted and unmalted barley in the original mix or someting completely different?<br /><br />The reason I say this is to question whether adding peated malt to a pure pot still is comparable to having a PPS where some of the malt is peated.<br /><br />I haven't a clue by the way. Just wondering. What does anyone else think?</div>
