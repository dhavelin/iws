				<div class="content">Just a wild, unformed thought...<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dublin City of Science 2012 will be a year long programme of events that will highlight the role and value of science in society.<br /><br />Partnerships are sought with those organising events to engage the general public with science during 2012, including those with a particular focus on “Science in the City” events for July 2012.<br /><br />The call for proposals is now open and will close on 30 June 2011.</div></blockquote><br /><br />How about the society bringing whiskey-making back to Dublin, as a demonstration? There is certainly a lot of science involved in fermenting, distillation and maturation. The Midleton lab might be willing to advise.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dublinscience2012.ie/pep" class="postlink">http://www.dublinscience2012.ie/pep</a></div>

				<div class="content">David,<br /><br />Interesting idea to me.  Phillip Hills of the Malt Masterclass does something like this as part of his events (there may be a link, I know about it because it's in his book &quot;Appreciating Whisky&quot; published by Collins in 2000, p/b 2002).  I think there's a mobile distillery in Switzerland too.  You'd need a licence from Revenue.<br /><br />Liam</div>
