				<div class="content">Thanks Adrian.  <br />I have now done my pondering. <br />In the BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs the rationale for choosing eight discs can be music associated with memories or incidents<br />in a person's life, or it can be eight favourite/loved pieces of music.  With my whiskeys I have largely taken the first approach.<br />1. Bushmills Black Label.  As an Ulsterman I am genetically predisposed to choose Black Bush. It was the whiskey I observed my elders drink when I was but a lad.<br />2. Greenspot. For me an island whiskey in that I discovered it (or rather it discovered me) nearly 30 years ago on Lambay Island when I was on a mision to cull seagulls!<br />3. Ardbeg 1978 20 Y.O.  In memory of an old friend.<br />4. Bowmore 30 Y.O. Sitting in the visitor's lounge at Bowmore Distillery at sunset, looking out at the distant coast of Ireland and drinking Bowmore 30 Y.O.(Thanks to Ally.)<br />5. Port Ellen 1972 30 Y.O.  Sublime. Used up all my spending money on the very first stop of last years whisky trip to Scotland.<br />6. Springbank 15 Y.O. As a post-hurricane or tsunami wave restorative.<br />7. Redbreast 15 Y.O.  No explanation needed.<br />8. Locke's Grand Crew.  To remind me of my friends in the Irish Whiskey Society as I wonder how they are faring on their respective desert islands. Of course if this country's financial situation continues to worsen, Ireland could well be one of these desert islands.<br />Slainte<br />Ken</div>

				<div class="content">I think I'll need a light bourbon-matured malt so I can experiment with desert island finishes. I'd fill it into coconuts and steep the wood of the breadfruit tree in it. Perhaps <span style="font-weight: bold">Knappogue Castle</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Locke's Grand Crew</span> too because it's a reminder of the society and a beautiful day on the Grand Canal.<br /><br />The <span style="font-weight: bold">Bowmores Black, White and Gold</span>. If I have to be stuck on an island at least I can try three of the best whiskeys that only a handful of people on the planet have sampled. I wouldn't feel so unlucky then.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Writers Tears</span>, because it's just so smooth and relaxing, and it'll remind me to write my diary.<br /><br />A <span style="font-weight: bold">port-finished Tyrconnell 10yo</span> for stormy nights (port in a storm, y'know). One of the first whiskeys that knocked my socks off.<br /><br />And I'll take <span style="font-weight: bold">my favourite from Peat Night</span>, whatever that turns out to be. I already know I really like a few of them and I figure Michael and Luke will be able to tempt me with the rest of their choices. I'll end up with a great peaty number for Christmas on the island.</div>

				<div class="content">A Desert Island whiskey is a whiskey that evokes strong memories or makes you go wow when it first hits your taste buds...<br /><br />(1) Black Bush... the one that got me started<br />(2) Redbreast 15 (1st bottling)... I didn't think Irish whiskey could be this good<br />(3) Tyrconnell Anima Negra... my favourite Cooley (so far)<br />(4) White Bowmore... a thimbleful on the lips but a lifetime of memories<br />(5) Caol Ila Distillers Edition.. my novice Islay trip, looking out from the still-house across the bay at the paps of Jura<br />(6) Greenspot... the legend goes on<br />(7) Powers... always will remind me of my grand-dad and the sweet smell of his pipe tobacco<br />(8) The special whiskey I'm yet to discover....<br /><br />So many whiskies, so little time</div>

				<div class="content">My wish list would be:<br /><br />1. Greenspot 12yo - a cask strength PPS from IDL - NICE!<br />2. Jameson RVR<br />3. Redbreast PPS 15yo<br />4. Tyrconnell Single Malt 17yo<br />5. Bushmills Millenium - I hope I'm not on the same ship as JohnM because there could be a struggle for this!<br />6. Powers 12yo<br />7. Blackbush - certainly one of the best 'entry level' whiskeys I've ever tasted.<br />8. Highland Park Earl Magnus - very nice, lightly-peated whisky, yummy!<br />9. Midleton - any year, though preferably post 1996. The pedigree speaks for itself<br />10. A giant bottle of Solpadeine  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Yes I know I've exceeded the 'magic 8' but I don't know how anyone could expect me to count properly under these pressure-filled, stressing circumstances; I'm about to be marooned you know <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">Going strictly by what I've tried already, from my notes in no particular order, it would have to be: -<br /><br />1. Bushmills single sherry cask - the quintessence of Bush<br />2. Green Spot - best value whiskey in the world<br />3. Dungourney 1964 - simply stunning finish<br />4. White Bowmore - don't think anyone will ever forget that one<br />5. Old Comber single malt - tremendous<br />6. Redbreast 15 yo (1st release) - a new high point for IDL<br />7. Locke's Grand Crew 696 cask - am hugely fond of this quirky Cooley (do we have any left, by the way?)<br />8. Laphroaig 30 yo SMWS single cask - sampled at Sydney Opera House, watching the lights on the harbour bridge, after coming fourth (by sheer luck!) in the Aussie SMWS annual tasting.</div>
