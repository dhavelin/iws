				<div class="content">Hi All,<br />Does anyone know how the 'launch' of the Slane Castle whiskey went? Newspaper reoprts I have read detail accounts of assaults and drug-related arrests - and from the report - that was in the VIP area, the proposed launch site of the brand <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" />  I'm sure this wasn't the start that the owners would have wanted for their brand. Still, I can't understand why they chose that setting instead of a more peer-reviewed launch such as an IWS / Slane endorsement <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> <br />Shame.<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">I've tried the Slane whiskey at this stage. To be honest it's ok. Standard enough Cooley blend. I'm afraid that while I love their malts and single grains the blends just don't do it for me. I know that makes little sense, when I love the constituents of the blends but there you go. <br /><br />Actually, there's one exception. I used to really like Millars, but haven't had it in a few years now.</div>

				<div class="content">yes, it is an ok whiskey<br />it is a blend made to be drinkable with coke and other mixtures for the US market<br />so you can not expect too much from it</div>
