				<h3>Future Cooley Releases</h3>

				<div class="content">So what would we like to see from Cooley over the next few years?<br /><br />Personally, much as I love to see single casks and limited editions, I also love to see a good wide core range of different ages and expressions. I'd love to see along these lines someting like:<br /><br />A regular 15yo and / or 18yo Connemara - I think the Connemara is ageing really well and I really like the 18yo amontillado finish. That might not be possible as a regular release but a good quality 15/18 should be. <br /><br />A regular 14yo Tyrconnell - of all the single casks I've tried I thought the 14yo from a few years back (can't remember which one) was outstanding.<br /><br />A 12yo high malt content (70/80%) blend with some (maybe 25-33%) sherry cask?<br /><br />For less regular bottlings:<br /><br />An older (maybe 16) madeira finish Tyrconnell?<br /><br />And I can't wait to try a 21yo Connemara - I've yet to meet a peated 21to whisk(e)y I didn't like!<br /><br />That's my dream list, for the moment!<br /><br />Oh and I almost forgot.. <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> .... some older SPS!!!!</div>

				<div class="content">i'd also like to see some older SPS and luckily, this seems to be obviously in the pipeline anyway so we can sit back comfortably and await getting exactly what we want.<br /><br />As for Connemara, i'd love to see something along the lines of what Aberlourr did with A'bunadh. i.e. a vatting of really old connemara (lets say 21) with some very young spirit and maybe a little touch from some interesting casks in the middle. The young connemara has always had a fantastic profile and i know jim murray and noel sweeney go on about the need for the young spirits inclusion in the normal and cask strength bottlings. I' love to see what this can do if given some real oak backbone etc with, again, maybe some middle aged casks with a possible hint of an odd barrel finish, bottled at a good strong ABV to give it that high alcohol tactile texture</div>

				<div class="content">All good recommendations there ... I'd love to see a Connemara fully matured in Sherry cask and not just finished. And older Connemara would be great too but I just shudder at the thoughts of price  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>I'd also like to see them bottle some of the old Powers and Bow Street whiskey they have...</div></blockquote><br /><br />They also have some really old Kilbeggan casks also but seemingly it is all under proof.<br /><br />So question??? can a distillery bring under proof whiskey up to legal ABV by adding enough high abv to get desired alcohol vol of over 40% or is this not legally possibly.</div>

				<div class="content">I really don't think they know what to do with that old stuff. Can't sell it as whiskey on it's own. Probably tastes like liquid wood at this stage.<br /><br />If they blend it what do you call it? Vatted pot still?? I think also IDL may object to the use of the Powers or Jameson names. I'm not sure a young potstill whiskey from could take much of such a woody spirit being blended.<br /><br />If I were them I'd sell it back to IDL, rather than dilute their own brands. Maybe the old Lockes casks could be blended with new whiskey from Kilbeggan alright.</div>

				<div class="content">I know that in Kentucky the strength of maturing bourbon can go up rather than down as water can be lost faster than alcohol.
