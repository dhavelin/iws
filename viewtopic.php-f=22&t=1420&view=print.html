This is no big secret actually. The number on the neck label JQ-058548 does not hold any major significance today.

				<div class="content">More trivia... Part of an old engine that was used in the Bow Street Distillery is now in the Engineering Block in UCD. I have passed it I don't know how many times without finding out what it was, and before Christmas found out it was from the distillery.</div>

				<div class="content">Without repeating what's in that photo...<br /><br />This was a very old-fashioned engine when installed, being almost identical to the beam engines of James Watt from 100 years before. This was because it was installed on the site of an earlier engine and reused the older low-powered boilers and had to fit in the same space.<br /><br />[... a bunch of technical detail...]<br /><br />In 1896 the distillery centralised its boilerhouse and the engine had some minor modifications made. The flywheel was replaced by a heavier one from Hick, Hargreaves of Bolton in 1908.<br /><br />The engine operated from 25 to 32 rpm, 175hp and was regularly used until 1932 and very occasionally for several years after that.<br /><br />It is, apparently, the only Irish-made beam engine now in existence.</div>

I can't remember the exact circumstances, it may have been the initial of the employee checking the batch.</div>
