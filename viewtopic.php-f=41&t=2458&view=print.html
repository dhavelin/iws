				<div class="content">Hi Guys, <br /><br />I've just returned home from years in London and was giving a bottle as a leaving gift from the Bank I worked at in 2005 of a beautiful Port Ellen Whiskey, the details below! I do know it maybe worth something and it's been well stored and I'll attach pictures too. I'm curious to know what it may be worth?<br /><br />So it's the Port Ellen 5th Release; Aged 25 Years, Distilled in 1979(my birth year so hence it's special to me) It's bottle number 2710 of 5280 bottled in 2005(makes sense as I left that job in 2005), 57.4% vol 70cl. It comes in the original presentation box too!<br /><br />Many thanks<br /><br />Ross</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ross<br /><br />I think you could expect to get about 1,000 euro for this. It would retail for more.<br />Regards<br />John</div>

				<div class="content">Hi John,<br /><br />Thank you very much for your reply and comments, that's great to know. Would you by chance know the best way to go about selling it, probably hard to do privately and auctions can take a fair bit of commission. <br />Much appreciated and thanks again. <br /><br />Ross</div>
