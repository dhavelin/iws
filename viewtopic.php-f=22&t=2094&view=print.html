				<div class="content">Many people, myself included, rate the Jameson Gold very highly. I would drink it without water but, as Zoltan says, dilute (just a few drops at a time) to your own taste. After you have tried it, do come back and tell us if you liked it. Enjoy!</div>

				<div class="content">Yes a lovely whiskey,<br /><br />As regards to water that really is down to you. It is never any harm to add a few drops to open the whiskey. However as mentioned previously if you find whiskey strong add what ever suits your tastes. If you really get into whiskey you'll find you'll add less and less anyway but a few drops are always an idea. Or leave in a glass for a while and warm in your hand to enhance the flavour experience.<br /><br />At the end of he day (as the saying goes) no man should ever water another mans whiskey  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">I always have a little water with me to test with a whiskey. I had an Ardbeg 10 year old earlier and it amazes me how much different it tastes with a few drops of water add to it. <br /><br />Jameson Gold is great with or without I think. With the stronger whiskeys its always good idea to have a glass of water anyway, not only to add to it but to re hydrate. I've learnt the hard way on many the cask strength bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for your replies. I love this whiskey. At first I tried it neat and it was a little too strong for me. I put a drop (as little water as I can pour in from another glass, not a jug). Very, very nice. My only problem is that I think this bottle will be gone sooner than I expected. I'm rationing myself but I really want to let loose. I also want to share it with friends....... but deep down I want to keep it all to myself. I think I'll go for the happy compromise: I'll share it with my imaginary friends!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
