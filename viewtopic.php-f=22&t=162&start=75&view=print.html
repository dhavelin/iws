				<div class="content">I have been reading these post for some time and have a question. <br /><br />If you had access to stock (grain and malt at a variety of ages and casks types) how many of you would want to create your own blend?  It could be any % or age (for example a vatting of old malts, or maybe a 80% grain and 20% malt, or maybe 90% young malt with a dash of old malt and grain...)  Is that something that you would be interested in?<br /><br />I like what you guys are doing with your own bottles at home. If the there was a away to get access would the IWS be interested in developing a blend?</div>

				<div class="content">I'd love to create my own blend, but I think I'd be very slow and use up a lot of liquid in the process. If I wanted my &quot;perfect&quot; blend, anyway.<br /><br />A blending masterclass with yourself, on the other hand, where you reveal the secrets of constructing a great blend, that would be a huge treat. Even if my own result fell short.<br /><br />I'm not all that taken with the idea of a committee-created blend. I'd rather have a single, experienced blender behind it. How about a choice from three &quot;premium&quot; candidates (like the Midleton single cask)?</div>

				<div class="content">I was using up a few dregs. All are standard supermarket brands so I mixed 2 parts Tullamore DEW, 1part Kilbeggan &amp; 1 part Jim Beam Devils cut. A nice blend and definitely better than the sum of its parts I think. I been trying various combinations recently and thus is by far the nicest.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I've mixed Beam Choice 8, the Kentucky straight bourbon with Bunnahabhain 12(the old bottling). It's a present surprise. <br /><br />I've tried various whiskeys both varying results but the favoured blending whiskey has been from the Beam stable. <br />I've got the regular, the choice, the black and Bookers and all have been interesting.</div>
