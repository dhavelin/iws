				<div class="content">Well I don't know about that.  Personally I'm not a fan of the three stills as I find it too similar to other logos and suggestive of triple distilling.  <br />I think a traditonal inclusive symbol associated with Ireland, and adapted to suit the theme would be our best bet, and promote an all-island organisation.  Thats why I'm fond of the four provinces motif, or perhaps a harp of sheaves of barley even?  <br /><br />Although, that said, at a later date when the society has more resources another could be chosen.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Zoltan, Just to let you know I have no issue with your idea and actually think it was a good one to start off and inspired the rest of us. However I do have one reservation though and that's its similarity with other whiskey groups  ... so therefore on those grounds I don't think it stands up to 'AN EASILY RECOGNISABLE GRAPHIC DESIGN ELEMENT' as it may be confused with others. Especially the Irish Whiskey Trail which is a commercial concern and I would not like IWS to be confused with that site. <br /><br />Also what you forget it your design was the <span style="font-weight: bold">ONLY</span> design people saw at the meeting (beside me holding up one for a couple of seconds) so in the absence of any other alternative people were just agreeing that is was a good design but that should not necessarily constitute that is right for the Society. <br /><br />Seriously Zoltan, I am not knocking your design but I am not keen on settling on something because of lack of choice. That is why we are trying to get people involved hence all the posting here but like the rest of the forum people are not overly interested in getting involved. And the 5 people who are posting here are probably the only 5 people that post on the whole forum regularly. There is very little interaction on the forum as of yet ... remember only 13 people with double figures in posts and only 7 with 25 or more. <br /><br />What we need to do it select a number of ideas and then get them done up professionally yours included and then voted on by the Membership. If your logo is still the choice of the majority I will be happy to go with it.<br /><br />I am throwing up as many ideas as I can just as it may spark off another idea with someone else.<br /><br />I would suggest that possibly in 2 meetings time we get a selection of ideas to be voted on and just knock it on the head.</div>

				<div class="content">I find, like Mr IWC, that logo ideas are still popping into my head. I think there was some urgency to the logo hunt at one point but it's not so pressing any more, right? Let's see what emerges.<br /><br />There is one other consideration for a logo design: scalability. If the logo can be described precisely in words in terms of basic shapes (rectangles, lines, circles...) and text then I can create a scalable vector graphic implementation myself and from there generate any imagery we need for the website and so on. That's great flexibility because a professional designer will probably supply the logo in eps format or something else we don't have the tools to manipulate.<br /><br />If the image is complicated, creating a scalable graphic is a ton more work, must be done professionally and might be expensive. And it limits the possibility of adapting the logo in house.</div>
