				<div class="content">Just a little bit of historical correction on the topic of the merger of <br />John Jameson &amp; Son Ltd., John Power &amp; Son Ltd. and Cork Distilleries <br />Co. Ltd. little mention  is ever made of the company name that ensued <br />initially when the merger came into being on 22nd. July 1966. The initial<br />name was 'United Distillers of Ireland <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> 'Irish Distillers' . <br /><br />World politics intruded in the form of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence <br />in Rhodesia on 11th. November 1965 which made the acronym <span style="font-weight: bold">UDI</span> of the newly <br />created company very controversial. Just dug out a lovely glossy booklet that I was <br />given that accompanied the launch of the new company 'United Distillers of Ireland'.<br />The re branding to Irish Distillers occurred not long after I believe and United Distillers <br />was subsequently airbrushed from the official narrative as if it never existed.</div>

				<div class="content">Was the precursor to diageo called United Distillers too?<br /><br />I often look up IWS for the Irish whiskey society and it directs me to Irish Water Safety. <br /><br />Another common one for me is IBD, the institute of brewing &amp; distilling. It turns up Irritable Bowel Syndrome. <br /><br />I'm guessing they were more sensitive to others 50 years ago.</div>
