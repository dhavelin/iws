				<div class="content">I have one, but am always on the lookout for another.<br />It's for my Dad who just turned 80. He grew up in Comber, but was too young to try the whiskey before the distillery shut. I finally got him one of the 80s bottling of the 33 yo a few years back and he cracked it this year at long last.<br />Unfortunately, he loved it and is now on at me all the time to source another!<br />My own bottle is collector quality, perfect box etc, so I'm on the hunt for something in less pristine condition for drinking. No box, damaged label, fine by me.<br />Equally, he's never had the original bottling of Comber - think it came in 7 yo and possibly 10 yo also. I'm on the hunt for either of those also.<br />If anyone ever feels the need to offload one, do keep me in mind, please.</div>

				<div class="content">You can get it in the Four Seasons, but you might be paying what you'd expect to pay for nearly a full bottle... Maybe McDaids off Grafton St would have it. They have it in the Vat House in Temple Bar, but I'd say they charge a fortune for it. Maybe the Temple Bar too.</div>

				<div class="content">I will keep you all informed on whats happening but i do plan to offer good value for IWS members.<br /><br />A bit of info is that we will be stocking most/nearly all Irish whiskey that we can get our hands on/afford! along with along with beer from all the Irish micro brewers and we will be knocking out good food to boot, matching it with beer and whiskey.<br /><br />Unfortunately there will be several &quot;opening&quot; nights as we try to accommodate everyone from all the different angles involved (Beer, Whiskey, Wine, Food, Suppliers, Family) and thats just the first week, im tired just thinking about it!<br /><br />But no doubt we'll will organise a special night for everyone here.</div>
