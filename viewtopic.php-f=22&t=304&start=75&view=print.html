				<div class="content">Bust open my 200ml JW blue with in an hour of getting it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />Imust say I was not expecting much from this as loads of people have slagged off the price tag for a meer blend.<br /><br />Well what can I say ... I am actually quite impressed.<br /><br />The nose for me was initially chunky round malt, some light but earthy peat notes and big fruity aromas like dried apricots etc. A very enjoyable nose.<br /><br />Quite rich and complex in taste also ... madeira seems to spring to mind but may have nothing to do with madeira casks. Light fruit cake, a mix of sweet and bitter. Obviously there is probably more that a better palate could find.<br /><br />Finish is excellent and very long. Big spice ... then drying and strangely some sweet sugar syurp appears on the tip of the tongue. Dry wood sticking to the insides of the cheeks and possibly a touch of liquroice. Still going on as I finish this explaination. This whisky is all about the finish.<br /><br />I also noticed and I know this is real nerdy but the legs on the side of the glass just stay for an age. Amazing for a whisky of 43%<br /><br />Well all I can say is that I'm very impressed with this whisky which has loads going on. Definately will not suit any mood but quite drinkable. Very complex whisky and I'll go as far to say a brilliant whisky but strangely I'm not sure if I could ever fall in love with it at the same time. Dont get me wrong I like it and you definately can appreciate the complexity of the whisky and you can totally enjoy everything about it. But maybe it's a bit too rich I don't know I just think I'd grow tired of it's style after a while. A good ofter dinner whisky or to accompany a cigar.</div>

				<div class="content">enjoyed a couple drams of bowmore legend last night while watching &quot;Coast&quot; on Blighty.  it dealt with the scottish NE to E coasts. on second though, i should have had a highland park, haha.  if anyone is interested, blighty is currently showing programs from their scottish season.  Made in Scotland is a great show.  caught about 3 episodes of it.  in one episode they were in islay at the  Bunnahabhain or Bruichladdich distillery...cant remember which, haha.  today they are showing 4 programs on the highland clans.  just a heads up if anyone is interested.  also, another show called Made in Britain has been dealing with scotland.  always a chance of some whisky talk on there, so i will be tuning in   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif" alt=":geek:" title="Geek" /></div>

I was expecting something more powerful but this is quite a fruity dram (peach/apricot vibe) actually the fruit is quite intense.

				<div class="content">I finally buckled and cracked open a bottle of the Bushmills 1608 anniversary - the one made with the crystal malt in the complicated packaging.<br />It's a bit more sherried than I remember with plenty of chocolate and fruit on the nose, as well as some old wood and caramel.<br />But it kicks in nicely on the palate, chewy and viscous, dark chocolate and nutty toffee notes with something wonderfully floral and fruity going on that doesn't identify itself for me till I swallow.<br />Then I'm getting strawberries and honey on the finish, along with the toffee.<br />Can't believe they were selling this for 30 quid at the distillery. I should've cleaned them out!</div>

				<div class="content">Finished off a few dregs over the past few weeks to make some room ...<br /><ul><li>Caol Isla Distillers Edition (finished in Moscatel Casks) - a superb whisky - the favourite on the Celtic Whiskey Shop's Isla trip a few years back and also favourite at my last December tasting.  I've some more of the same in reserve.</li><li>Lagavulin Distillers Edition (finished in Pedro Ximinez casks) - another favourite - rich, fruity with a decent level of peat.</li><li>Bruichladdich 15yo - very sad to see this bottle go.  I had a bottle of the 17yo purchased maybe 7-8 years ago.  that was superb but I wasn't able to replace it with another and so settled for the 15.  This one got better as the open bottle aged - again fruity with a nice level of peat.  I've kind of gone off Bruichladdich a bit - there's a very distinctive &quot;taste&quot; to each of their whiskys but bizarrely absent from that wonderful 15yo.</li><li>Black Bush - once finished, had to be replaced (about two label designs old!) - BB has taken over from Powers as my regular pub whiskey.</li><li>Tyrconnell - I had this bottle for a good while too, again the older label design - another old reliable.</li><li>new bottle: Port Ellen Provenance 26yo (dist. 1983) (Douglas McGibbon's) - (see <a href="viewtopic.php-f=22&amp;t=34&amp;start=50.html#p4318" class="postlink">here</a>)</li></ul>Tonight ...<br /><ul><li> trying Rittenhouse Rye - fantastic nose - its very reminiscent of rum, very sweet - very &quot;brown sugar&quot;.  Its undeniably smooth, but there's no length to the finish.  This is the only rye I've ever tasted, so I don't know how &quot;representative&quot; this one is.</li><li> trying Appleton Extra Jamaican rum alongside the rye.  It has much more character than the rye, more elements/notes whatever!.  I've just nosed another four rums (even one from India) - and all have a bit more going on than the rye.  On the other hand, some of those are &quot;off-notes&quot;.  The rye is very very one-dimensional, but very &quot;clean&quot;.  The taste/finish don't live up to the nose or maybe I just don't get it. </li></ul>/M</div>

				<div class="content">Wow, Michael.<br />That's some line up! Love that Lagavulin Distillers Edition. I'm hoping to spot it on offer somewhere soon.<br />Like yourself and David, I've been trying to clear some space by finishing off some bottles.<br />Now that's been achieved, I can finally crack open some more!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />I've started with the Tyrconnell 10 yo Port Finish, which I've been wanting to get stuck into for a good while.<br />On the nose I get ripe pineapple, loads of fruit sugars actually, which break down on the palate into orange peel, mandarin segments, a bit of mango and plenty of spicy notes from, I presume, the port pipes.<br />It has a nice linger about the finish too, which is impressive for a young, light Irish whiskey.<br />The better half, who is a peat fiend, raised an impressed eyebrow when she had a sip. It's possibly the first time ever she's been impressed by a non-smokey Irish. High praise indeed.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
