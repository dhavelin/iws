				<div class="content">Hi all and sorry to be asking favours again, but this is <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">the place</span></span> when it comes to Irish Whiskey &amp; distilleries.<br /><br /><br />I spent the last few days collating information for a new little feature on WhiskyEmporium; A list of all Scottish distilleries, who owns them and what their capacities are.<br />Here is the page:<br /><a href="http://www.whisky-emporium.com/UK/Features/WhoOwnsWhat.htm" class="postlink">http://www.whisky-emporium.com/UK/Features/WhoOwnsWhat.htm</a><br /><br />Is it possible to get the same info for Irish distilleries?<br />I think there are only 4 actual distilleries, or is it 5 with the new opening of Kilbeggan?<br />But there are many more brands or labels and I doubt I know them all.<br /><br />Can anyone point me to list or help me collate one with the relevant info.<br />Also, are capacities published anywhere?<br /><br />Keith</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Adrian,<br />I really hadn't realised Pernod Ricard &amp; Diageo were so prominent in Ireland, but I should have done as I dealt with both when I had the pub  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />This immediately begs the question as to whether I should include &quot;Irish&quot; in the same table under the same companies, but I won't. I intend to keep Ireland separate, although I may include some total statistics later in a review of &quot;Scotland, Ireland &amp; maybe USA&quot;<br /><br />I have a few things to do today, but hopefully I can get this information online later this evening.<br />Keith</div>

				<div class="content">There is possibly one other distillery to add to that list but they have yet to start construction which is a worry as it was supposed to be up and running already  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">Looks ok ... just one thing though, the 4.5 mla for Cooley is circa what they are producing yearly so their technical capacity may be higher but I'm not sure what that would be.</div>
