				<div class="content">I would like to see Pernod reintroduce a 15 year old, be it a Power or Jameson or even a Midleton. They must have plenty of stock for this. I'm not really a fan of the Ultra premiums, Midleton and Jameson 18. I think the likes of Powers Johns Lane and Jameson Gold are far better.<br />They could plug these and introduced the others when they are better established.</div>

				<div class="content">A 15yo blend or Sps?<br /><br />The redbreast 15yo I think is pretty much a permanent release at this stage. They even have a new plinth in Midleton with RB15 and Yellow spot as well as the others.</div>

				<div class="content">I like a 15 year old blend and another heavy Pot Still like the Jameson that was out for the Millennium.<br /><br />The Redbreast is great but I think there is plenty of room in this area. <br /><br />A 15 year old blend may cost €60-80 which would attract me more than the 18 year old Jameson for €120.<br /><br />I seen that Plinth you mentioned, massive thing.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with you will about the Jameson pot still (especially after the bottle we stumbled over on the last trip). Heavy trad pot Midleton sps with a big wallop of sherry. What i love about that particular example is the success with which they manage to balance such aggressive flavors against each other.</div>
