				<h3>ROSC Whiskey</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />I was searching the web for my father who has a bottle of ROSC created by Irish Distillers to celebrate Dublin's Millennium in 1988 - the label design is fantastic by a Jim FitzPatrick I think.  Can anyone advise if he was considering selling it what price would a whiskey collector expect to pay?  Or where would he go to sell it?  Dad seems to be going through his collection - I think he has one bottle of a 25 year old Jameson too - since the 1980s but he didn't ask me to research that. <br />Thanks in advance for any help.</div>

				<div class="content">Lovely label all right, I'm a big fan of Jim's art work however what I think you have there is a liqueur and not whiskey.<br /><br />The vol states 20% which is not legal to be called whiskey but the vol is so low it would suggest something along the line of a liqueur though. <br /><br />The 750ml also means it was possibly made for the US market but then again it was back in '88 so we could still have been using the 75cl size but I can't remember of hand.<br /><br />So unfortunately I do  not think there is much collectablity in it for a whiskey collector and is more of a curiosity, but still maybe €100 but that is a complete stab in the dark but surely worth that.<br /><br />Where the real gold may lie is in the 25year old Jameson. Is it a Jameson or a Midleton. If a Midleton 25yo possibly worth anything from €1000-1500 in the open market, just to be aware a retailer will be looking for 2500-3000 for it but do not let those figures cloud your judgement as colectors will not pay retail for a bottle such as this especially when they cost less than €400 less than 10 years ago. But that one came out in the late 90's Millenium period. If it is a Jameson we would  need to see a picture.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Irish Whiskey Chaser,<br /><br />Shows you how much I know about alcohol - my dad said he thought it was a Mead (unsure of spelling) but I always thought that was a different type of whiskey - regardless I'll let him know your information - thank you.  Again I would have to check with him regarding the Jameson - originally he had 3 bottles - one we, as a family celebrating the birth of the first grandchild, opened back in the early 90s.  The second I'm sure he sold only a few years ago to a whiskey shop in Dublin City and again I'm unsure how much he received for it, but I think it was only a couple of hundred.  Photos I can't get until the weekend, sorry.<br />Will be in touch again when I can access a photo.  Again thank you for all your help.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Irish Whiskey Chaser,<br /><br />I chatted to my Dad in relation to the ROSC and the Jameson.  Unfortunately, he is only interested in selling the ROSC and my mistake, the Jameson is actually a 15 year old not 25 - my mistake.<br /><br />Thanks you again for all your help and information.
