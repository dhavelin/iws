				<div class="content">Johnny Walker Gold is usually an 18yo so I presume you mean this one.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Johnny Walker XR 21yo</span><br /><img src="http://www.moodiereport.com/images2/johnnie_walker_xr_21yo_1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If not the one above post a picture.<br /><br /><br />Don't think you'll get many JW fans around here willing to pay anything close to that figure mentioned. The XR 21yo is a Travel Retail Exclusive to the Middle East and retails at $105.00 (US).</div>

				<div class="content">Graham86, be warned that <span style="font-style: italic">selling prices</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">for sale</span> prices are quite different things. Here in Britain, people will pay much less at auctions than what readily sells from retailers - some of which are hopelessly overpriced - often at only 50%. Good luck with the sale though, stick it on eBay, and tell us what someone was prepared to pay for it.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
