				<div class="content">Oh well I been keeping an eye on this months whiskyauction all month.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5</span> bottles of <span style="font-weight: bold">Midleton 26 year old.</span><br /><br />There were 4 with boxes and one without. <br /><br />They ranged in price from 2 at <span style="font-weight: bold">€712</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">€753 &amp; €792</span>. The one <span style="text-decoration: underline">without the box</span> made only <span style="font-weight: bold">€450</span>. What a difference a box makes? I had the underbid on that but didn't try any of the others. Very good prices considering the quantity for sale. If they had been dripfed to the auctions they may have made more. <br />Other notable bottles were <br /><span style="font-weight: bold">John Jameson 12 Years</span> old Special Old Irish Whiskey <span style="font-weight: bold">€105,</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Green Spot -€125</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Cooley-WM.

However these can be got at a reasonable price from the states still. So I would currently value these at between 250-300 and this may be less than what you originally paid for them. SO if that ios the case you'll need to hold on tio the for a few years yet to see any return.<br /><br />The Dunvilles we would really need to see a picture and depending on type and whiskey style possibly €5-700 or if modern €30-40  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

They were other Bushmills Malts and Jamesons but nothing worth noting I think. This auction had a great selection of Irish whiskeys and I hope to see more. All lots exclude commission+vat and P&amp;P will also add to the cost.<br /><br />I didn't purchase any as the commission and postage can be off putting, but I also have to take into consideration the exchange rate if I'm buying in UK auctions.  A £100 bottle can soon cost €190 when all these are taken into account.</div>
