				<div class="content">Hi MollyJim,<br /><br />Nice bottles. The condition looks good too. <br /><br />The 1985 Midletons come up occasionally but rarely with the Glass. It would retail for €800 or more. Privately you could expect €400 or so I'd expect. <br /><br />The 1989 Midleton is newer but again rare and I've only seen one at auction recently. It would retail for €800 or so too. Again expect €400 privately. <br /><br />The 2002 would retail for €400+ but private sale it should be about €250-300 I think. <br /><br />The plinth with bottles would retail for €420-450 if pieced out. I'm guessing the Midleton doesn't have a box or cert. It's probably a 2000-2003. It may be worth separating it for the others. It could get €200+ without the certs etc. Some collectors wouldn't want it without. Expect €300+ for them privately probably a little more. <br /><br />I know the retail and private prices are very different. The retailer has profit margin, rates wages to add to the cost. They would probably offer less than the private market. <br />Another option is auctions. You have to time these well and choose carefully as commission, charges and postage will eat into the hammer price. Put into the wrong auction and you may get bad results but again put it into the right one and you could be very lucky. <br />The plinth bottles would not achieve higher than retail in auction I believe. If they were from the 1990's they may just about but not worth the risk.</div>
