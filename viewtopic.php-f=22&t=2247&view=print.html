				<div class="content">A friend of mine has asked me to organize a Whiskey tasting.  In the past, I've organized many wine tastings, and a few Scotch Whisky tastings, but never an Irish Whiskey tasting.  The goal is to taste 4-6 Whiskeys and from that know what kind of Whiskeys a person likes.  To narrow down the wide range of Whiskeys, so that a person knows what part of that range they like.  But I'm having trouble figuring out how to do that.<br /><br />(For comparison, for Scotch Whisky, it is not that hard, because there are &quot;tasting charts&quot; which label Whisky based on light/rich and delicate/smoky.  Buy choosing one Whisky from each quadrant, and one from the middle, a person can quickly narrow their tasting preference to one region of the chart.)  Unfortunately, I can not find anything like this for Irish Whiskey.  Is there something like that?  Or some other way to broadly categorize Whiskey tastes?<br /><br />Thanks for any help.<br /><br />Joshua Levy</div>

				<div class="content">Here's a couple of early ones from the <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.singlepotstill.com/">http://www.singlepotstill.com/</a><!-- m --> site.  <br /><br />They seem to contradict themselves too. The Yellow Spot was changed. They were an early addition to the site and were removed.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks so much!  This is exactly the kind of thing that I'm looking for.<br />I'll see if I can find one with more/different Whiskeys.  If anyone has such charts, please do post them, or links to where they are.<br />This is great.....<br /><br />Joshua Levy</div>

I know your aware of that but just to clarify to others reading  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Good as a tasting reference but will not not help someone looking to pigeon hole the various different Irish expressions.<br /><br />Good spot though I did not even remember I had it linked. This is actually from the Whisky Mag website just so as people know. Some good info in there if you search.</div>
