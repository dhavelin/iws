				<div class="content">I remember that we discussed the possible withdrawal of Jameson 12 from the Irish market a few times over the last few years. I believe the first time anyone noticed was when it was taken off the German market. Rumours had it that they were running short of 12 year old plus whiskeys and wanted to concentrate on NAS Jameson. then the Jameson Select Reserve arrived in Small Batch to add another few questions. <br />The Small Batch soon disappeared of the label and now the Select Reserve is replacing the 12 on supermarket shelves. Sadly the price hasn't been reduced to reflect the fact that younger whiskeys are used in the make up. Great whiskey anyway.<br /><br />I have a nice collection of 12 year old's dating back 60 years. I wanted to know was I missing any other than the Dublin 1988 Millennium commemorative bottling.<br />I had a hexagonal bottle with a screw cap and black label like JJ12 in the last picture but it was pried away from me, dam recession.<br /><br />Open to ridiculous offers like houses, sports cars or 6 figure sums of good currency   <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

It looks similar to the LMdW Distillers Selection bottle.<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">That's the one then. That bottle was exclusive to Aer Rianta in 1988. <br /><br />That's 14 different styles of labels over the last 50 or so years and 1 commemorative bottle. <br /><br />I'm assume they'll sell Jameson 12 in the Asian market. Age statements seem to command better prices there.</div>

				<div class="content">The Jameson 12 year old with the Red Label ( Middle bottle in middle photo )<br />was already exclusive to the Asian Duty Free market. You could get it here at <br />one time a couple of years back in a 50 cl. bottle double pack with another Jameson<br />not though in either a 75cl. or litre bottle.</div>
