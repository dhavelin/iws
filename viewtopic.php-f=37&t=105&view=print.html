				<div class="content">Okay I've decided that it is time for a break away group already  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I know there are a few people in Galway that are into Irish Whiskey or even just WHisk(e)y. SO I hope that we can get a few more people to join the Irish Whiskey Society.<br /><br />So I am hoping to get this going so I won't have to trek up and down to Dublin all the time.<br /><br />Whether or not join the society it would be nice to be able to meet up with a fwe like mind individuals here in the west.<br /><br />I have so far been in contact with McCambridge's, Harvest, Neachtain's pub &amp; Freeney's pub. I have posted flyers and hope that I may get some response.<br /><br />I am also going to advertise on the Galway part of boards.ie<br /><br />Hopefully in time we may be able to get a nice group going.<br /><br />I had a good conversation with Luke in McCambridge's and he has hinted that there could well be a few whiskey tasting in store shortly anyway so that is a positive.<br /><br />So if your interested and Galway based get in contact and lets try and get this going.<br /><br />This is obviously not going to happen over night and will require some organising so please have patience.</div>

				<div class="content">It could be a while before this happens as I need to see if it generates enough interest.<br /><br />I was talking to one of the Managers in McCambridges though, and he was saying that they would hopefully start doing some tasting themselves. So if the IWS in Galway comes to naught we can latch onto them.</div>

				<div class="content">Okay, we've had a few rumblings from the Bar industry in Galway in relation to holding some tastings whom I am glad to say are taking their whiskey bars very seriously.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />I am opening this thread again nigh after over 4years in the wilderness.<br /><br />Basically I'm putting a call out for any Galway based people who would like to start up a chapter of the irish Whiskey Society in Galway.<br /><br />We will already have support (in theory) from various bars so we'll not be in any difficulty for places to try.</div>

I was researching Persse's myself at one stage but Family life unfortunately took over.<br /><br />Fair play for setting this up as it is a great idea to get people interested and we may even see a few whiskey enthusiasts there that may be interested in setting up a Society branch.</div>

				<div class="content">There's a nicely growing interest in and development of whiskey tourism in Galway in the last year or so through An Pucan, Garavans, Freeneys and the G Hotel, all of whom are offering a nice range of whiskey tasting platters backed up by very helpful and knowledgeable bar staff.<br /><br />Many Dublin bars would do well to pay a visit down West and see what's going on!<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Stuart</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all. <br /><br />The tasting with An Púcán went really well. The food was excellent as were the drinks and pairings.<br /><br />Hopefully events like this will get more interest in Irish Whiskey and IWS.<br /><br />The chapter is / was in discussion - there is already support from Galway bars and retail offering venues for events and discount for IWS Members.<br /><br />There is an IWS comittee member looking into it and I think a subcomittee too.<br /><br />In the meantime there will still be events going on for Galway people to attend.<br /><br />All the very best from Galway<br /><br />Cyril</div>
