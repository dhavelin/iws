				<div class="content">Good question. Would the increased surface area of whiskey (as in, more wood touching smaller amounts of liquid) increase the aging process?</div>

				<div class="content">I aged some young 3 yo whiskey for only 4-5 months and circa 40% of the contents evapourated. I know it did not leak as I checked it regularly and had placed paper under it and there were not leak stains. I used a 1l oak keg, seasoned it with Amontillado sherry which did add to the whiskey. Certainly changed the whiskey but initially was way too woody. Left it for a while and the woodiness receded but still evident. So the idea of not leaving it too long is also very true.<br /><br />Basically the tiny size of 1l &amp; 5l casks not neccessairly need too much time in the cask to change the charachter of the whiskey whether it gets the complexity and smoothness of many years in a larger cask is debatable. However leaving your spirit for a very long period in small casks may leave it un palatable.<br /><br /><br />It really is a matter of checking the taste every month as you proceed.</div>
