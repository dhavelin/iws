				<div class="content">&quot;America gained independence 235 years ago, the Whiskey Rebellion occurred 220 years ago over the first US tax on Whiskey, this year is the 150th anniversary of the start of the American Civil War in 1861. From those tumultous days up to the 17th January 1920 when the 18th Amendment of the US Constitution brought prohibition into effect, American Rye whiskey was the spirit of choice in the United States. Following the ending of prohibition on March 22nd 1933 Bourbon became the drink of choice as it was quicker and easier to produce.<br /><br />Just twenty years ago, in 1991 the Buffalo Trace distillery nearly closed and this represented the nadir in the American Whiskey industry. Fortunately they survived and a mere 10 years later in 2001 their now famous Sazerac Rye was voted World Whiskey of the Year by the influential Malt Advocate Magazine.<br /><br />A story evocative of Irish Whiskey's 'Single Pot Still' style demise and resurrection, will be celebrated by the Irish Whiskey Society's next tasting on the 26th May. We have assembled some of the best American Rye whiskies available. These include, Pikesville Supreme, Ri1, Wild Turkey 101, Russell's Reserve, Van Winkle Family Reserve, Sazerac 18yo &amp; Thomas H Handy Ryes.<br /><br />This is a unique opportunity for newcomers &amp; members, bartenders &amp; mixologists to discover the world of American Rye whiskey.&quot;<br /><br />Booking is open for this event on Thursday 26th May so please check back soon...</div>

				<div class="content">Bumping this in case, with all the Whisky Live excitement, that some forgot we still have a tasting this month. A tasting I'm really looking forward to since it's going to fill a huge gap in my knowledge, namely American Rye.</div>

				<div class="content">I just noticed the special offer of membership + Rye tasting for â‚¬50. That's a great deal! How about an email to point this out? It's bound to push a few over the edge. I can think of a few people this might work on so I'll let them know.</div>

				<div class="content">Well done Leo for the tasting, very good selection of ryes.  Last one was my favourite.<br /><br />The cocktail making was good fun.<br /><br />I found a copy of the Whisky Bible at the tasting.  If you lost one, send me a PM and I'll bring it along to the next tasting.</div>
