				<div class="content">The Sale of Alcohol is prohibited on Ebay unless you have a licence to sell alcohol and registered your licence with Ebay.<br /><br />However collectable bottles are permitted if advertised as so.<br /><br />Ebay has a section covering it.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/policies/alcohol.html">http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/policies/alcohol.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />The sale of alcohol-related memorabilia is permitted, including packaging and unopened bottles, decanters, or limited edition cans that still contain alcohol.<br />Each of the following conditions must be met and stated word for word in the listing, in the same font size as the rest of the description:<br /><br />    <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic"><ul>The value of the item is in the collectable container, not its contents.<br /><br />    The container has not been opened and any incidental contents are not intended for consumption.<br /><br />    The item is not available at any retail outlet, and the container has a value that substantially exceeds the current retail price of the alcohol in the container.<br /><br />    The seller will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the buyer is of lawful age in the buyerâ€™s and seller's jurisdiction (generally 18 years of age in the UK and Republic of Ireland).<br /><br />    Buyers and sellers both ensure that the sale complies with all applicable laws and postage regulations.</ul></span></span><br /><br />We suggest copying the above bullet points and pasting this text directly into your listing.</div>
