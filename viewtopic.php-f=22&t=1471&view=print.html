				<div class="content">Hi all, in an attempt to start giving this here SPS book project of mine some spine, i thought it might be worth cataloguing all known SPS/PPS bottlings that are still floating around. I include in that list currently produced whiskeys, special releases from the near or distant past, and even the silent distillery fossils that're worth more than one should reasonably expect to pay for a small country. Here's the list that i've compiled. I've tried to organize it by distillery so let me know if i've made a mistake, especially between the old midleton distillery and the new. What am i missing? Thanks guys.<br /><br />(New Midleton Distillery)<br />Redbreast 12<br />Redbreast 15<br />Redbreast 12 CS<br />Green Spot<br />Green Spot 10<br />Green Spot 12 <br />Powers John’s Lane<br />Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy<br />Jameson 15<br />(The first CWS cask, dont recall the number, but am i right in thinking it was an SPS?)<br />3rd CWS Midleton Single cask 71578 (2010)<br />4th CWS Midleton Single Cask 74060 (2011)<br />Terminal 2 Whiskey Collection Midleton Single Cask<br /><br />(Old Midleton Distillery)<br />Dungourney 1964 Pure Pot Still<br />Midleton 25 year old pure pot still<br />Midleton 26 year old pure pot still<br />Midleton 30 year old pure pot still<br /><br />(Cooley)<br />Cooley Single Pot Still Poitín<br /><br />(B.

By pure chance I was drinking them side by side when I read your post. And I still prefer the blend!</div>

				<div class="content">not sure about WT, might include them as a special category and note the malt element and the peculiarity of the idea etc. Definitely leaving out Redbreast blend though as the book really is meant to be an ode to sps specifically</div>

Given the current rolling stone of SPS releases, any book on the subject will almost immediately become slightly out of date. Thankfully, i'm a slow worker anyway so it'll be a while before its finished  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> And at the end of the day, i'd like to have done my bit to give that same rolling stone a good kick if nothing else</div>

				<div class="content">If you make it an e-book the problem goes away. The factual books I buy these days, I get them before they are officially published with updates when they are published and to fix errors. There is no reason extra content can't be added in at any time, keeping it fresh for new buyers and adding value for previous purchasers. From time-to-time, a &quot;new edition&quot; comes out which everyone has to pay for all over again (if they want to).<br /><br />Having a primary e-book version doesn't preclude having printed copies.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not buying any more physical books unless that's the only option, or in certain other exceptional cases (some fictional books, say).</div>

But I undertand Amazon, Apple and others have tools available for turning raw text into polished ebooks. Might be worth a look. Especially handy for self-publishing, if you were thinking along those lines.</div>
