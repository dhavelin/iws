				<div class="content">I can't really decide where I want to be tonight - so far Laphroaig 15, Midleton, Cragganmore, Tyrconnell AN Cask. About 1/2 measure of each to try and find my mood. Finally settled on an Ardmore Traditional Cask - now this is a lovely peated whisky. So where to go from here? I see Caol Ila mentioned - maybe I'll open the Distillers Edition I've been looking at for a while.</div>

We are now the only Highland distillery that insists on fully peating our standard malt and we will never change.<br /><br />The fermentation vessels we use are crafted from Oregon pine. It is true that they are more labour intensive but they impart a flavour that stainless steel vessels (now widely used) can never give.<br /><br />Our traditional methods also extend to maturation. Traditional cask is double fermented first in the usual oak casks but then a second time in much smaller hand crafted “Quarter Casks” they were common a hundred years ago but have been largely ignored due to their high cost of construction. This intense secondary maturation gives the deeper smother flavour our whisky is renowned for.<br /><br />Finally we bottle at the higher strength of 46% ABV (or higher).</div></blockquote></div>
