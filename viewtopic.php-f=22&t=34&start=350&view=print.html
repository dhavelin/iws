				<div class="content">I should have added, that these were in Saint Aidans Crescent  Pettits. The 3 Swallow was not on the shelves at 10.30 but produced from store in due course. I think that the Paddy was also €24 and the Jameson is in new presentation box.</div>

				<div class="content">If you go to Dunne's and buy a bottle of Redbreast 12yo for €60, you get a voucher for €10 off your next purchase (within the following week) over €50 which-- by coincidence-- might well be a another bottle of Redbreast, at net cost of €50 therefore.  Seems good maths to me! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Very True!  And I should have made clear is that with your purchase of the second bottle of Redbreast (say) you get another 10euro voucher to use with your third purchase.   And so on .............ad infinitum?<br />Slainte!</div>

Great price. <br /><br />I was sent a photo of Powers 3 Swallow in Tescos for €37. I've €21 in vouchers so I think I'll spend €16 and get one. Definitely a bargain.</div>

I love to know how they are doing it.<br /><br />€20 23% less vat = 15.40 less Duty (11.92 per 70cl bottle) = €3.48<br /><br />So basically they are selling a bottle of whiskey for €3.48 when you deduct all taxes .... nuts.<br /><br />I suppose they are all going to push this to get people through the doors for Christmas before the law comes into force where they can't sell at a discounted loss.</div>
