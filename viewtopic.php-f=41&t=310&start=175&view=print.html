I've lots of different 12 year old from over the years. I have one 12 year old that had a similar style label to this but it was out in the 60's I believe. <br /><br />I noticed a few variations to the 7 year old. The one pictured is late 30's early 40's I think. The one with Pot Still on the label came after that in the 50's. Then they had a label similar to the older one but i believe they were using a blend by that time. I'm only guessing here and welcome any knowledge on it.<br /><br />I know they're lots of them out there and I'll get one at a reasonable price soon enough I hope.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with your assesment.  TWE has a post &quot;Pot Still&quot; one as well, for stupid money.  I had a line on a +/-1960 &quot;Pot Still&quot; one in a brown bottle that was duty free from Shannon Aeroport, but US ebay closed the auction down as part of a crack-down on booze sales.  It was on that bottle's back lable I saw that wheat was in the mash bill.  Items still sneak through though, like my  &quot;Royal Shannon.&quot;</div>
