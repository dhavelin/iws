				<div class="content">The 80's is spot on !! Read the attached booklet. If it is<br />the one I think it is it will reference the water as having <br />come from the Vartry river which will mean it's from John's <br />Lane.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with Raven. The 70's one didn't mention Smitfield and the stopper wasn't in the bottle. <br /><br />It's from Johns Lane Distillery. I've drank a few from the 70's and it's great whiskey too.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks chaps.<br />The booklet is all in German, no problem I can understand it but I see no mention of Vartry river, maybe they lost something in translation.<br />It does have a recipe for Irish coffee and also mentions drinking it on the rocks  <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> <br /><br />Is the stopper cork?<br />I'm just wondering if I'll have problems getting it out in one piece?<br />Malty</div>

				<div class="content">Mine were cork but they were older than that one. I don't see why they would have changed. <br /><br />I checked Wikipedia to see when the brand was sold by IDL it was 1994. They never mentioned it being made in Johns Lane but that wouldn't surprise me. That stopped distilling in 1975 so yours could be from Midleton if it's into the 80's.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes the stopped should be made of cork. Earlier version had a driven cork with the ceramic topped cork stopper hanging at the side.<br /><br />It is not from Tullamore as it has the<span style="font-weight: bold"> Tullamore Dew Company Dublin Ireland </span> I believe earlier crocks which had been bottled from the original stocks of Tullamore from the 50's and was used up to probably mid 60's would have been bottled under either<span style="font-weight: bold"> D.E.Williams LTD </span>&amp; later <span style="font-weight: bold">Tullamore Dew Co Ltd</span> i.e. without the Dublin association to the company name, I believe this is the case but can be corrected on that.<br /><br />However as this is a European bottling there are 2 big clues on the bottle.<br /><br />The 40% gives the clue that it is post Janurary 1980 due to the EU standardising the % from <span style="font-weight: bold">over proof</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold">ABV</span> in Janurary 1980.<br /><br />However it was not till Janurary 1990 that they standardised spirit bottles to 70cl.<br /><br />So your bottle is between 1980-1990. Sorry I can't be any more accurate <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div>
