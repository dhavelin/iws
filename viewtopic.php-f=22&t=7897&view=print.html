				<div class="content">Hi TallyB,<br /><br />I believe these would have been the original release of Irish Man Whiskeys.<br /><br />I am guessing the E1414 is a Single Malt.<br /><br />But unsure what the AD1459 is? Can you tell us what is says on the label.<br /><br />Are they both in Clear plastic cartons? A picture would help but the L code should be on the side of the bottle near the bottom.<br /><br />Anyway I believe these were from 2006 so would be L6*****</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />E is the batch number, and is one of the first, or maybe even the first batch od The Irishman Single Malt.<br />Batches seen in the first couple of years of release include batches E,F,G,H,M. AD is a much later batch.<br /><br />Sheers TWB</div>

				<div class="content">E1414 bottle is coded L6, The AD bottle is not mine so can't comment on it. I know that the E coded bottles are the first batch. Just wondered what the E code actually stood for. <br /><br />Thanks for your input guys.    <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I've no idea as to the origin of the batch system either and whether E was the first but as thewhiskeybro says I too believe it was the first release.<br /><br />I have E1705 which I purchased at the time of release. They originally were released in batches of a maximum of 6000 a time I believe but that may have changed since.<br /><br /> I also have the Irishman superior which is the blend and then changed to the Irishman 70 and now the Irishman Founders Reserve.<br /><br />Not sure what type of blend it was originally but it is now a blend of PPS and Malt so nopt aa grain blend as we're used to. And similar to their other creation the wonderful Writers Tears.</div>
