				<div class="content">It only says By Appointment. No name was given.<br /><br />I took out the deck of cards and found a very interesting little certificate in the cover. Its a cert from the eminent analyst Sir Charles A.Cameron, it tell us how good Jameson is. this copy is signed and dated 13 June 1911. I looked up Cameron and he was a head of public health for Dublin Corp for 50 years. He died in 1921.<br /><br />The deck is by special appointment to his majesty the king. The man in the picture isn't Charles Cameron as the only picture of him is of a large bearded man. <br /><br />I assume the minister of the interior is now the Home Office. I couldn't find any historical data to try guess who the man pictured is or why he was honoured in the photo and on the deck of cards.</div>
