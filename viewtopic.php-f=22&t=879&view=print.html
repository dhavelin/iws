When I got into whiskey I was regretting not being able to taste the output of the original distilleries. Since then I have tried some of them and none were any great shakes. A Redbreast 12yo in the Bull &amp; Castle stands out as particularly awful.<br /><br />Barry Crockett said the same thing at our PPS event. He said they make whiskey the same way today, just with much better quality control. I don't think that's marketing. I think he's right.</div>

				<div class="content">I could be wrong, but I think Barry Crockett was particularly referring to much older whiskey, but I agree generally. Whiskey is much better today. I do like that particular flavour of stuff from the 50s and 60s, though. It's unique. <br /><br />I love Powers, but had a Powers pure pot still mini that I opened and it was awful. I kind of hope it was just gone off or something. But I had a Paddy blend that was really good, very much like the older Powers blends that I like. Maybe the output was much more variable than it is today.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, I think that old minis are crashes waiting to happen ... They are obviously some much less able to fend off the rigours of ageing possibly due to the flimsy screw caps they usually have ... The Preston Jameson mini I had lately is testament to that.I have not yet had a mini that was not ruined whether Irish or Scotch. Old full bottles of Powers &amp; Blackbush as already mentioned have all been good though.<br /><br />In relation to the mint I think is a common trait in some PPS especially younger PPS.</div>

And someone said that we have fans of that old stuff, but I thought at the time that probably nobody there would have tasted whiskey from this era.I don't think he'd bet that nobody there would like something like a Midleton 1967, a Bow Street 1963 or one of the old Cadenhead Tullamores. <br /><br /> He also said that the quality control was much more difficult without the modern checks and with the old direct-fired stills, referring to the 'more recent' stuff from the old distilleries. So that era was also discussed. But I think this was in relation to the consistency of quality. <br /><br />Anyway, I'm open to correction on all this.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>jcskinner wrote:</cite>It just made me think how lucky we are to live in an era where even the entry-level whiskeys, the youthful whiskeys, the blends, are of a high quality.

				<div class="content">It is an interesting topic and one that holds some validity. I happened to come across a snippet from a Pamplet Titled &quot;Scotch Whisky&quot; printed in 1890. Obviously the scotts were as adept at self promotion as the Irish were at this time. These are an interesting couple of lines &quot; ... the maturing of whiskies has increased  to a very great extent in recent years. People will not drink new Whisky, as they used to not very long ago, and, to meet demand for old whiskies, immense warehouses have been errected.&quot;<br /><br />This snippet exposes the common practice of selling new spirit as whisky which the big Irish Distilleries were totally against and actually did not consider it whisk(e)y but insisted on aging their whiskey. However let us not be fooled that Irish distilleries did not practice similar antics. <br /><br />Imagine drinking new spirit or even spirit aged for less than a year as your regular tipple <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>

				<div class="content">This quote seems apt at this juncture:<br /><br />&quot;Quality in whisky is more than age. Even the poorest spirit can become old, though never palatable. Whiskies put down for ageing must have quality from the very start.&quot; <br /><br />This was originally published on 14th June 1924 in Wine &amp; Spirit Trade Record. The text was re-printed as an illustrated pamphlet called A Good Foundation which was, in effect, a marketing brochure intended to persuade whisky blenders to purchase Highland Park new make spirit.<br /><br />(Courtesy of a HP mailshot)</div>

				<div class="content">On the age matter, if you look at advertisements and the sales by whisky brokers in the mid to late 1800's a lot of whiskey were sold very young. (c.3 - 7 years)<br /><br />How older whiskies became more popular I'm not quite sure, more wealth thanks to the industrial revolution, post 1860 - 1885 boom excess stocks leading to older bottlings, a change in palettes/tastes etc, the advent of more whiskey being kept in private cellars (post that moxy wine thingy), I'm not quite sure.<br /><br />But certainly by the turn of the last century (1900s) the prevalence of aged bottlings seems to have grown...<br /><br />Good topic for an essay.</div>
