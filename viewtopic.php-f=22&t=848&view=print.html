				<div class="content">Im not sure,<br /><br />ive seen this happen so many times, label changes, people think the whiaskey changes, even when they try to think otherwise.<br /><br />If a brand of whiskey kept the same label for 10,20+ years theres a good chance the whiskey will change any way, diffrent grain percentages, different equipment, diffrent distillers, different blenders etc etc <br /><br />Distillers spend alot of money trying to iron out these factors, but for me i dont care to much, its the beauty of the industry.</div>

This is not about a psychology, it is about a true head to head comparison. I own two bottles, one with the old label and one with the new label. I poured drams of both into two glasses of the same type (classic Malt BTW, if you are interested to know) and compared them side by side. <br /><br />The difference really is as big as I state in the article. If you still don't believe, please contact me so we can arrange a sample deal. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Michael Foggarty wrote:</cite>Distillers spend alot of money trying to iron out these factors, but for me i dont care to much, its the beauty of the industry.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Call me old fashioned, but I can't see any beauty in the fact that a great dram has been significantly reduced in quality. I agree that batch variation of standard botlings can keep things interesting (just look at the hardcore Ardbeg fans and their L number fetishism). But dumbing down a good blend by reducing the malt content certainly does not fall into this categry anymore.<br /><br />Happy dramming,<br />Oliver</div>

				<div class="content">Distillers do change recipes from time to time for all sorts of reasons, like pressure on stocks etc. I have heard that the whiskey in the standard Jameson has gotten younger because of this reason.  And I think Greenspot has changed a bit recently (although I could be imagining it). <br /><br />I must pick up a bottle of the new Kilbeggan to try it out.<br /><br />And welcome to the forum Oliver.</div>

				<div class="content">I have to agree in one way that when there is a change in livery that people feel there is an associated change in the whisk(e)y and it always seems to be to the detriment. However usually the change in livery results in a price hike which I always find assaults the taste buds  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />But on the other hand there is definately a scenario of changes in brands and this cannot be denied, Jameson, greenspot as mentioned by JohnM ... and the one I have noticed is Lagavulin 16yo which I feel has really mellowed out on the smoke front in comparison to what it used to be. So yes I can believe that there could be a radical change in Kilbeggan.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello John and Oliver,<br /><br />   Whoa!  Thank you very much for the &quot;heads up&quot; on the &quot;old label&quot; KILBEGGAN.   I decided to try Kilbeggan a couple/few months ago.  Bottom line, I LOVED it!  I too placed Kilbeggan stright away at THE top of my personal &quot;best bang for the buck&quot; Irish Whiskey.  Here in the State of Maine, Kilbeggan is THE least expensive Irish Whiskey sold ($15.89 tax included) for a 750 ml bottle.  I will surely purchase more of the &quot;original label&quot; Kilbeggan ASAP!  Thanks again for the &quot;heads up&quot; and welcome to the IWS.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats! aka Tom Patrick</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   Well, today I purchased ONE (old label) bottle of Kilbeggan for safe keepings.  I plan on stocking up on Kilbeggan <br />(while the getting is good) when money allows.  I truly believe Kilbeggan (old label) is well worth the effort of hunting them down to have for the future.  I know of no better &quot;budget&quot; Whiskey (at this price point).  Should the Liquor stores run out of the old label Kilbeggan, no doubt POWERS would become the best budget Whiskey (at a cost increase of five or so dollars more than Kilbeggan).  <br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi IWC,<br /><br />   I hope this note finds you well my friend.  Well, at least here in Maine (at present) only the OLD label Kilbeggan available. <br />I really like your idea about trying the two side by side but, to be truthful, I'm hard pressed to spend even $15.00 on<br />(what I'll take on Faith from the above review) a sub par bottle Kilbeggan.  I would rather spend the $15.00 on another<br /> &quot;old label&quot; bottle of Kilbeggan (while it's still on the shelf) or apply the $15.00 towards a $30.00 bottle of Black Bush.<br />I also need to reconsider KELLAN as another INexpensive (under $20.00 in NH) good budget Irish Whiskey.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>
