Remember Tullamore only closed in 1954 and they were the first kings of the blended Irish whiskey (in a modern sense) at that stage with Tullamore Dew.  To give you perspective they only started up their column still in 1948 and produced shed loads of the stuff. So much so that they could blend away for many a years to come until IDL began to supply and eventually took over Tullamore Dew completely in 1975.You also have to take into consideration of what else was happening then too ... Kilbeggan hit the wall also and there was all that whiskey to off load too so Irish Whiskey was easily available, plentiful and cheap. So if Tullamore grain was used the earliest the 10yo would be is 1958 but with standing that you also have a similar 15yo so we'd have to push that out to 1963 as I would imaging both would have been launched at  similar time.<br /><br />Just food for thought as this is all speculation by me but you need to be aware of why so many different brands pop out during this time.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd forgotten Tullamore, but John's lane grain (that rhymes) would seem to be too late.  I wouldn't say I have hopes for them, they're curiosities I got for very little money.  I think this one was $50 US including postage.  No matter what they are from closed distilleries, just because they have grain in them doesn't make them a single blend either.  Or do they have grain in them?  I might open on of the 15 y.o. to investigate.  I agree with the time frame you propose, thanks for your thoughts, they are a bit of a puzzle for me!</div>

As you say could easily not involve grain at all as you allude to.<br /><br />All part of the fun  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">By my math there are three, possibly four, distilleries at that time that might well have been disposing of stocks of whiskey.<br /><br />1. DWD, but that is a bit on the early side. (1945)<br />2. Tullamore, but they kept on with their brand and Irish Mist. (1954)<br />3. Old Comber. (1953)<br />4. Brunsa. (1953)<br /><br /><br />My understanding of US labelling laws rules out Old Comber as that would need to be &quot;product of UK,&quot; but I could be wrong.<br /><br />Of course this could be a bulk sale from Cork Distilleries as they did do that.  Or it could have been blended by casks from a broker.</div>

				<div class="content">Okay, here's the scoop.<br /><br />Tax stamp is series 112 that was used1942-1963.<br /><br />Base of the bottle seems to indicate a year of 1962 moulded into the glass (62). <br /><br />So, long story short the evidence says it is from 1962/63.  <br /><br />Now -- where did the booze inside come from????

				<div class="content">Ok have thought about this a small bit more and conclusion still leads to a mainly Tullamore grain blend.<br /><br />All other distilleries that closed close to that time were pot still in the main.<br /><br />I also remember remarking to myself when I first saw the picture, and the little of the green glass bottle I could see, that the whiskey seemed very light in colour even through green glass. <br /><br />Now looking at the label more closely it states &quot;An especially <span style="font-weight: bold">light</span> blend of superlative Irish Whiskies&quot;.<br /><br />This implies that there are &quot;whiskies&quot; used in this blend and could easily come from different distilleries but the lightness surely has to point at a largely grain based whiskey. More over if it was a Tullamore pot still or any other pot still I would have imagined they would have celebrated that fact on the label (but maybe not). I also think light whiskey was order of the day back then anyway, hence the lack of interest in purely pot still whiskey.<br /><br />However the source of the Grain is most likely Tullamore. They had massive stocks and were constantly producing a surplus so some were indeed sold off in the bad times. No other distillery in Ireland produced enough grain that would have been for sale in enough quantity for it to be sold off in a bad market (Just my opinion).<br /><br />Also from the Offaly Historical Society<br /><br />I read that in the 1940's they Exported 40% of their output, a further 30% was sold in the home market and 30% was bonded annually. This confirms they were building up huge stocks going into the fifties and was due to wonderful sales during the war and early post war ...<br /><br />&quot;During the war years and up to 1952 home consumption rose from 494,242 p.g. in 1939 to 770,299 in 1952, while exports increased from 167,239 p.g. to 458,784 in the same years.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A rise in the spirit duties both in the Republic and the U.K. in 1952, along with a fall in U.K. demand as Scotch came off ration after the war, sent exports tumbling in 1954 to one-third their 1952 level. Home consumption also fell.&quot;<br /><br /><br />It probably is the most logical source of the whiskey but maybe it is not grain based at all <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div>

We still have &quot;Royal&quot; institutions here so it can't have been too controversial to keep the adjective in a name. I remember the discussion in Hong Kong around the handover when &quot;Royal&quot; disappeared from the Hong Kong Jockey Club, though there was no pressure to do so. I only wondered then if there had been a similar debate in Ireland. If anything, feelings on the subject might have run higher in the US among Irish-Americans.</div>

				<div class="content">One further little contribution on the subject - being a product of Ireland does not necessarily exclude Northern Ireland in which case the Royal prefix could apply even now. That said I think the use of the word &quot;Royal&quot; may actually need permission in the UK which would definitely make this a rep of Ireland whiskey.</div>
