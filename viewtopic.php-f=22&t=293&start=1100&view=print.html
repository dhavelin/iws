They have a poor choice but do stock the Three Swallow for €40. <br />They stock Pogues for €29.95 but I've too much respect for myself to buy it especially if you can get Power's Gold label for €24, Crested 10 for €30 or even Paddy for €19.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi everyone!  Long time lurker, first time poster.  I just got back from my first ever trip to Ireland where I was able to get some things not available in Chicago.  I had $200 to spend and picked up the following...<br /><br />Palace Bar Single Malt<br />Crested Ten<br />Locke's 8 Year<br />Writer's Tears<br />Cork Gin <br />and...just for kicks because I had $20 left...Lidl's own Dundalgan<br /><br />Now the last time I got some Irish not available in the US, a friend brought me Paddy and Locke's, both of which became available within a year!  Locke's disappeared but Paddy is still available.  So rejoice USA Irish whiskey lovers, some of these are bound to become available...</div>
