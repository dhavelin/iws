				<div class="content">Was watching Layercake last night on tv and there are a few few scenes where the characters were drinking whiskey - in one scene between Colm Meaney and Daniel Craig they are drinking Lockes's 8yr old and there is a also a bottle of Tyrconnell on the table.  In a later scene Craig is on his own drinking a scotch of some sort ( couldn't make it out )<br /><br />Also when I watched the wire Jameson was the whiskey of choice by a mile . <br /><br />I've seen blackbush many times in the movies too.<br /><br />Any other notable placements  of Irish Whiskey ?</div>

This synopsis contains spoilers  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />The Irishman chronicles the rise and fall of infamous Cleveland gangster Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson), who engaged in a power struggle with the Italian mob. Greene was as an upstart longshoreman union rep and later became a cocky, legendarily difficult-to-kill troublemaker in the world of organized crime in the 1970s. Based on the real story of mobster Danny Greene, Christoper Walken will play the loan shark and nightclub owner Shondor Birns and Val Kilmer is a Cleveland police detective who befriends Greene. The incredible ensemble cast includes Vinnie Jones, Marcus Thomas, Vincent Donofrio, Linda Cardellini, Laura Ramsey, Paul Sorvino, Mike Starr, Tony LoBianco, Vinnie Vella, Steve Schirippa, Jason Butler Harner, Robert Davi and Fionnula Flanagan.</div>
