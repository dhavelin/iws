				<div class="content">Drunk driving is a growing problem. The more the authorities threaten you, the more people get nailed for drunk driving, or being involved in crashes.<br /><br />I don't believe in driving while impaired, and I've never been stopped or arrested for it.<br /><br />That said, what are the penalties for drunken / impaired driving where you live?<br /><br />In my state in the US, first offense is loss of license for six months, assorted fines and surcharges and insurance increases.<br />Second offense is loss of license for a year, along with the fines and surcharges.<br />Third offense is loss of license for ten years, or longer, depending upon severity of what you were stopped for (as in, stopped for cause, accident, or other circumstances)</div>

				<div class="content">I feel the same way: &quot;Just don't do it&quot;.<br /><br />I have a CDL (commercial driver's license) and holders of such a ticket are allowed HALF the blood alcohol level of regular drivers. Instead, of being legally drunk at 0.08, someone with a CDL is allowed only 0.04, which is about one drink. Not worth it, even if you live close to the pub.<br /><br />I see so many people who drink and drive on a regular basis. A few have been caught, and still they drive.<br /><br />One to ponder: If you are &quot;legally&quot; drunk at a certain level, how is that illegal? You are LEGALLY drunk, right?</div>

We have public order acts where there are actually laws that make it &quot;Illegal&quot; for people to appear in public under the influence of intoxicating liquour. The only problem with it is that very rarely imposed.<br /><br />Intoxication in public place. <br /><br />4.—(1) It shall be an offence for any person to be present in any public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he might endanger himself or any other person in his vicinity.<br /> <br />[GA]  (2) A person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.<br /> <br />[GA]  (3) Where a member of the Garda Síochána(Police) suspects, with reasonable cause, that an offence under this section or under section 5 or 6 is being committed, the member concerned may seize, obtain or remove, without warrant, any bottle or container, together with its contents, which—<br /> <br />[GA]  ( a ) is in the possession, in a place other than a place used as a dwelling, of a person by whom such member suspects the offence to have been committed, and<br /> <br />[GA]  ( b ) such member suspects, with reasonable cause, contains an intoxicating substance:<br /> <br />[GA]  Provided that, in the application of this subsection to section 5 or 6, any such bottle or container, together with its contents, may only be so seized, obtained or removed where the member of the Garda Síochána suspects, with reasonable cause, that the bottle or container or its contents, is relevant to the offence under section 5 or 6 which the member suspects is being committed.<br /> <br />[GA]  (4) In this section—<br /> <br />[GA]  &quot;bottle or container&quot; does not include a bottle or container for a substance which is in the possession of the person concerned for a purpose other than the intoxication of that or any other person;<br /> <br />[GA]  &quot;intoxicated&quot; means under the intoxicating influence of any alcoholic drink, drug, solvent or other substance or a combination of substances and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.</div>

				<div class="content">Gardai = a bunch of grumps LOL<br /><br />Laws are similar here in the US, although most enforcement is for driving under the influence. I had a friend who was stopped - walking home - from a tavern two blocks from his home. He was charged with public intoxication (he admitted he was plowed). He went to court, and explained to the judge that he was walking because he didn't wish to take the chance of driving. Of course he was drunk, that's why he went to the tavern in the first place.<br /><br />The judge bought his argument. He got a warning to behave himself, but he wasn't cited for public drunkeness.<br /><br />Score one for the little guy!</div>

				<div class="content">There is no excuse. Looking at the chart, I was surprised to see that someone my size, I'm a big guy, 6' 3&quot;, 240 lbs, could basically drink a bottle of wine in an hour and still be legal. A drink at dinner and you should be fine. Beyond that and you need to make other plans!</div>
