				<div class="content">Hi Scotty,<br /><br />No idea if it is originally an Irish product or not but it has long been produced in Ireland and it has been on the market since at least the early 80's, unfortunately my memory does not go much further than that  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  . Of course it may have been produced under licence which would not be unusual but I could not say for sure.</div>

The google search said the brand  was invented  by some Russian and itis  made in russia.<br /><br />Perhaps its that old russian claim that &quot;WE DID IT FIRST&quot;.  In the  19fiftys i remember getting sick of hearing that said. ;p;</div>

It really is inconclusive as to the origin of the Brand just that they distilled the brand in their premises in Dublin back in the late 70's early 80's. However I thionk we can say that Gilbeys owned the brand rights in Ireland at that time, but whether those rights extended further afield is very unclear or whether it was their brand in the first place. Further, I would be very slow to read too much into Wikipedia reporting unless there is corroboration else where which as you mention is few and far between.<br /><br />Interesting question though and one I'd would like to know the answer to also.</div>

Place in a pressure cooker cover with water and cook potatoes until they break down and basically disolve. Let cool and strain any bits from the potato juice and simply distill .... bobs your uncle.</div>

				<div class="content">Isn't Gilbey's owned by Diageo?<br /> <br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>During the 1990s one of Piotr Smirnov's descendants started producing Smirnov (Смирновъ in Ukraine) vodka in Russia, claiming to be &quot;The Only Real Smirnov&quot;. After a number of lawsuits, Smirnoff successfully reclaimed its trademark, while in 2006 Diageo concluded a joint venture deal with the Smirnov company.<br />The Smirnoff company had the naming rights to the Smirnoff Music Centre, a concert amphitheater in Dallas, Texas from 2000-2008. They also sponsored the Smirnoff Underbelly, a major venue at the Edinburgh Fringe.</div></blockquote><br />also<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Smirnov (Russian: Смирнов) can be seen as the Russian version of Smirnoff vodka. It is made by the Smirnov Trading House, a company that is part of a joint venture by Russia’s Alfa Group and Diageo, the owner of the Smirnoff brand. The full title of the Smirnov Trading House is The Trading House of the Heirs of P.A. Smirnov.<br />Smirnov vodka was launched in 1991 by Boris Smirnov, a scion of Pyotr Smirnov, the original producer of the spirit. After many lawsuits, which resulted in Diageo’s brand being banned in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Russian brand became a “sister product” of Smirnoff vodka.</div></blockquote><br /> <br />Think of this as Smirnoff vs Smirnov ( apparently most Russians prefer Smirnoff ).
