				<div class="content">Glenlivet Master Distillers Reserve<br /><br />Bought for a steal at £29.99 for 1L in Heathrow on special offer in my London purchases outlined on thread below!<br /><br />Matured in three casks american oak, traditional oak and sherry and blended together! Unfortunately its a 40%!!<br /><br />Decided to have a tasting last night and this is a non peat smoked very smooth balanced scotch which with every sup called for more. I intended having a tasting dram but ended up having a good few measures as was so smooth and would be quite amazing if available in cask strength as it could handle it.<br /><br />On special offer at £29.99 for 1L i have to admit as much as it hurts no Irish whiskey in price range would match up. Its sad but I can see true Irish fans moving more towards Scotch every day as far superior value is available!</div>

				<div class="content">coryvreckan didn't do much for me either and the subsequent bottlings have done dramatically less. The 70's Ardbegs had that gorgeous floral back note of almost lowlandy lilac (the lost lowlanders come to mind) that not only made itself miraculously heard over all the smoke but made the smoke itself that much more interesting. I have a good friend in California who insists that Ardbeg died with the disappearance of that inexplicable floral tinge to the smoke and i can see where he's coming from. No idea what they're doing differently these days but it's just not there. Some of those 70's casks were vatted in to Uigeadail which may be what i'm really tasting there but a lot of the new stuff is just smoke for the sake of smoke. Laphroaig Quarter Cask is gorgeous stuff isnt it. Like drinking an estuary.</div>

				<div class="content">Laphroaig's whisky is a lot heavier than Ardbeg's. Very different whiskies, I think. Both sweet, though. <br /><br />I remember hearing something about the purifier in the spirit still at Ardbeg. Was it &quot;turned off&quot; at the distillery in the 1970s or something like that? Not sure if I'm getting  mixed up.<br /><br />Anyway, I think Ardbeg produces great whisky and I love the Corryvreckan, but there are Ardbeg fans who will say anything the distillery produces is fantastic, even if it's sludge.</div>

				<div class="content">there's a little bulbous copper 'sweetener' along the lyne arme of the ardbeg stills for a little extra vapour-copper contact to encourage a few extra esters in the distilled vapours before they condense... no idea if it's changed since the old seventies bottlings</div>
