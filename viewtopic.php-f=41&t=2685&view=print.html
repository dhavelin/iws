				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />I have a bottle of MVR 1985, it is all there i.e. outer sleeve, box, cert, invite etc (all in perfect condition). Unfortunately it is not the 'full fill' anymore. The cap is sealed OK, but I got it checked out and was told it has probably been left on its side for too long, and some of the contents may have leaked out over time.<br /><br />I realise it will not be worth what a full 85 would fetch but it is still a bottle of 31 year old Midleton Very Rare all the same. Please see pic attached, if anyone has any interest in it please PM me.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">The attachment <strong>MVR 85 full picv2.jpg</strong> is no longer available</div><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ian</div>
