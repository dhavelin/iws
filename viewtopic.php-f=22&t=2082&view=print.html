				<div class="content">Hi and Welcome to the Forum.<br /><br />Is the Hewitts spelt Whiskey or Whisky? I know mine was without the 'e'.<br /><br />If you use the upload attachment tab when your writing a comment you can put up photos. They may need to be downsized as there is a limit to the size of photos you can upload.<br /><br />If your having a problem PM me and I'll upload them for you.</div>

				<div class="content">I believe it changed in the late 60's early 70's around the same time as Paddy. This was when IDL was forming and the new distillery was built. <br />I don't know the exact dates but think it was around then. I stand to be corrected. I'd love to get a chance to spend a few weeks in the archives to see what I could dig up. <br /><br />I'm guessing the older one would be worth a little more.</div>
