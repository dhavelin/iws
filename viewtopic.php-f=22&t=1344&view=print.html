But this looks like a refurbishment.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>DavidH wrote:</cite>I count 6 stills in there, which doesn't make sense to me.

They have 2 wash stills currently but production is limited by the 2 spirit stills (or 1 low wine and 1 spirit still which is really one of the muchness though). They can continue with the 2 wash stills and ramp up production with a double set of spirit stills. One wash still per set of spirit stills which is the traditional set up.</div>

They would copy the current pot still line exactly. (The grain stills would be different though.)</div>
