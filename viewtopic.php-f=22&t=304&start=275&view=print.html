				<div class="content">The Midleton Jameson reserve and the Bow st jameson reserve used to be very different whiskeys - ahs anyone tasted them both recently? I've a feeling they're not so different anymore.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of the Midleton reserve, both the older and the newer bottling. There was a time in Midleton when you could get a sort of hexagonal 3 pack with one 700ml bottle each of the Midleton, Bow St and Bushmills distillery reserve. I wish now I'd kept it and not drank the lot. Give the subsequent sale of Bushmills it'd be a nice one to have. Actually, no, I just wish I'd bought an extra one - the whiskeys were all very enjoyable. Make that and extra 3!</div>

				<div class="content">Having the last of a bottle of Greenore 15 here myself.<br />I have to say, I was never mad on it. I always preferred the 8 yo myself. But it's a fine snifter nonetheless, sweet and leathery, with plenty of bourbon qualities.<br />I think I remember Noel Sweeney admitting something similar at Whisky Live in Glasgow a few years ago. Anyhow, it's being replaced by the 18 yo, which should be an interesting dram. I wonder how the wood will have made a difference over the extra three years.</div>

Then had an Ardmore Traditional cask. <br /><br />Then attempted to create an Irish vatted malt from 4 distilleries, with mixed success. It worked much better with about 40% greenore 8, making it a blend of course.</div>

				<div class="content">Investigated my newly found whiskey craving with a comparison of Greenspot and Red Breast. Still like the Red Breast best, but found the Green Spot a bit more 'manly', doesn't have the Red Breast sweetness and burns the mouth a bit more (in a good way). Could have drunk more of both were it not Monday night. Picked up a good supply at Duty Free in Dublin, Red Breast 15 will be tested at the weekend (new edition as I've discovered reading here.)</div>
