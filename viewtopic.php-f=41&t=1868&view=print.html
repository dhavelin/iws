				<div class="content">Does anyone have any experience with selling to websites. I have 2 Irish bottles I was looking to sell so I forwarded them on to the purchasing team at The Whiskey Exhange. They responded saying they would buy them if they were UK Duty Stamped. Not entirely sure about this but I'm guessing since I bought these bottles in Ireland, it will now prohibit the Whiskey Exchange from purchasing them from me. Anyone ever come across this?</div>

				<div class="content">I sold a few bottles to them before and they had no issue with them. They were bottles that were not available on the market so that may have made a difference. <br /><br />What ones were you trying to sell them?</div>

				<div class="content">I have 4 bottles (from 4 different cask) of the Midleton Terminal 2 single cask. I was hoping they'd take all four as a set, but they only want two. Seen them selling one a few months back but it's gone now. If anyone wants all four drop me a message before Monday. <br />Martin.</div>
