				<div class="content">If anyone isn't familiar with Jim Beams Small batch bourbon collection, they are Basil Hayden, Know Creek, Baker's and Booker Noe's. <br />I've tried 3 of the 4 bourbons from the collection. I've yet to try Baker's. <br /><br />Does anyone know where I can get them in Ireland or even the EU? I'm really partial to Bookers but would like to try Baker's too. <br /><br />Has anyone tried them?</div>

				<div class="content">Haven't tried Baker's, but I looooove Booker's.  I have always enjoyed Knob Creek, though it seems that the only times I have it is when I am at a chain restaurant in the US...go figure.  The KC is not overly complex, but it delivers a nice, well balanced, hit of vanilla/caramel sweetness with the oak/wood influence present, which is great for just kicking back and sipping.</div>
