Too much of their own-label stuff is just nasty. In the week before Christmas last year, I put a bottle of 'Finest' Armagnac in my trolley. It was around £28-£30. There was nothing fine about it. I've had better from a bottle at half that price. If I'd noticed 'Contains colour - caramel' on the back label, it would have gone straight back on the shelf.</div>
