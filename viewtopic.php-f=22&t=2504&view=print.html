				<div class="content">There seem to be a few &quot;one off&quot; bottlings about at present that are unbelievably popular. Two that spring to mind are Greenspot Chateaux Leoville barton  &amp; redbreast mano a lamh.<br /><br />Are these genuinely rare one off's or is there any chance they could become a more permanent addition to product lineup's, even if its just a few hundred or thousand bottles released yearly?<br /><br />Havnt tried the redbreast yet, but Il be very sad when the Greenspot special edition is gone as its just outstanding, id have 10 bottles in reserve if i had the resources to do so!</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure if the Green Spot CLB is a one off. I think it's here to stay for a while at least. The Mano A Lámh is limited to 2000 Bottles. <br /><br />They will be releasing various other editions over the next few years too. The Dair Gaelachs are an interesting bottling.</div>

Sounds interesting nonetheless.</div>
