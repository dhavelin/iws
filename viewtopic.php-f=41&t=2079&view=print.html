				<div class="content">A few years back there was at least a couple establishments claiming 100 Irish Whiskeys. One was a hotel in the North west somewhere but I've forgotten it's name. But to be honest it is hard to say.<br /><br />Would be interesting to hear what The Temple Bar is at these days. The palace Bar never would have been one of the big ones to me.<br /><br />Loughlins in Ballyvaughan had a large display with a fair selection open as did Greens in Kinvara Co Galway but  Eugens in Ennistymon had quite a large selection.<br /><br />Flannery's in Limerick has quite an extensive selection too and that was before he started extending so no idea where they are now and he too decided to go Irish only.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>patricksparis wrote:</cite>Cheers for the info, i have just about 250 different irish whiskeys, all available to taste</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Hi Patrick,<br /><br />I think that may be a hard target to beat as you will have the majority of your stock which is now out of production.<br /><br />However I cannot say for sure but logically I would doubt if anyone else has a bigger selection of Irish at this stage. <br /><br />I would find it hard to believe that there are any where near 100 Irish whiskeys available at wholesale currently so you will be up against other specialist whiskey bars which have invested in limited editions and older expressions now out of production.<br /><br />Looks good to me but I seriously must check out Flannery's in Limerick again as Liam was on a good collecting roll when I was last talking to him.</div>
