				<div class="content">For some reason, I wrote in my notes from the Cooley trip last year that the recent Mallorcan wine-finished Tyrconnell was maturing in a poplar cask. It's clearly oak so I don't know where that came from. Anybody else take notes that day? Who mentioned poplar? And is a poplar cask even possible?<br /><br />That reminded me that the laws defining Irish whiskey don't specify oak, just wood. Do we know of any whiskey matured or finished in a cask not made of oak?</div>

				<div class="content">I thought whisky always had to be matured in oak. I always wondered what it would be like if matured in something like maple. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5KMWnNbYXc&amp;feature=fvsr">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5KMWnNbYXc&amp;feature=fvsr</a><!-- m --></div>
