As for the labels, yeah, hopefully the porterhouse marketers can come up with something more interesting than the Erin go brath breed...</div>

				<div class="content">Every new still in these islands that I've heard mention of in recent years has come from Forsyths in Scotland. They really cornered the market (or just managed to be the last company standing, I don't know). Sadly the days when we could build a pot still (or a locomotive engine, or a giant telescope...) in this country seem to be far behind us.<br /><br />I wonder who did build the giant stills of the old Irish factories.</div>

				<div class="content">Even Forsyths build very few stills. The most common method is to recycle older stills of which I think they are still quite a few available from various closed distilleries.<br /><br />I would imagine the Dingle Distillery maybe new stills as I'm guessing they are small stills but I would not be surprised if they were refurbed stills too.<br /><br />The second still in Kilbeggan was a new still as it was made to order and the stills in Kilcomman were new stills but Ithese are quite small operations. I've not heard of any bigger stills made for larger operations but in all fairnes I've not kept a close eye on what is comming from Forsyths. I have a feeling there maybe another company like Forsyths but think they solely do repairs.</div>

For example at Bushmills in recent years. I assume they take a template from the existing stills and have them reproduced so as not to change the nature of the spirit they are producing.<br /><br />Bushmills is probably not an example of Forsyths' work, however, since Diageo has its own copper works in Alloa (where the Roseisle stills were made, I just discovered).</div>

				<div class="content">That's correct David. Porterhouse pulled off a bit of a coup in landing a catering contact for the China Expo 2010 and in addition to building an actual bar on the expo site, they will be overseeing the 'transfer' of that bar to Shanghai(?) where it will be more permanently located. So they have a bit on their plate at the moment. <br /><br />That said, I'm also surprised that more information hasn't been forthcoming. I don't expect too much news from them given that it will be a number of years before they can produce saleable whiskey. It would help develop interest and a following if they managed a 'diary' or 'work in progress' blog! The Ardbeg marketing model might apply very well in their case.<br /><br />Also, I heard a terrible rumour that they may initially be focusing on white spirits such as vodka, etc. <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />J.</div>
