				<div class="content">It was a cheap enough whiskey when it was released. People drank it. It was taken off the market in a hurry. I've heard a few different explanations for this, but don't know which is true. Anyway, there were selling for huge money a few years ago, but have come back since. You can still get a good few bob for them, though. <br /><br />I heard about painting barrels the whisky is  matured in with Bailey's but am not sure if this is true. I had a taste, and it reminded me of Powers, but that was a long time ago. Not as good as Powers. I'm not an expert taster, however.</div>

				<div class="content">It was test marketed in Dublin pubs exclusively ( but never released )-- The Temple Bar for instance was where I saw it <br />at the time. I got a bottle a few days before the scheduled release early 1998 through a friend after working the phone. <br />I had been given the release date and was told that there would be a lot in the press etc. but the day passed <br />and nothing......All sort of rumours abounded at the time and it is all a matter of conjecture. Stories of leaking <br />barrels, bad whiskey etc. etc. Wherever the truth lies nobody is talking but look logically if in the U.S.<br />Bailey's is a hot name selling well ( Irish Cream that is )then perhaps am I going to supply you with whiskey<br />if it was going to undermine my brand ??? Conjecture just simply conjecture <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'm definite the launch never happened. It was pulled at the last moment as I recall.<br />I cannot say what happened to what was already bottled but if it had been for sale in <br />other shops there then should be a lot more of it around -- it is fairly scarce. From the<br />design of label, design of bottle ( braille on the actual bottle ) it was never intended to<br />be a bargain basement whiskey but more like a premium job so some of what was bottled<br />rather than be wasted could have been sold off cheap.</div>

				<div class="content">Just found the advertising material that accompanied my bottle.<br />One line says' For we have taken traditional, triple distilled Irish Whiskey<br />and introduced it to the Casks which once housed the Baileys Spirit blend'.<br />This line is probably where the myth came from about painting cream on the<br />inside of barrel  ------------ no mention whatsoever of anything as heretical as<br />that !! Very detailed tasting notes from Jim Murray also accompanied it with<br />his final Comments :<span style="font-weight: bold"> ' This is a spankingly good whiskey which makes the mouth <br />water with its early Pot Still character. heaps of character, enlivened by the Spice <br />and softened by a gentle sweetness.In this form 'Baileys The Whiskey' has to be <br />something a genuine whiskey lover must take sertiously. I adore the complexity. <br />But most of all I love its rugged,unyielding Irishness.'<br /></span></div>

				<div class="content">Just found a reference to a 'Launch' of Bailey's irish Whiskey in Sean Boyd's book<br />published by Blackwater Press (2009) 'Behind the Horseshoe bar' Page 54 refers to Christina<br />Forest and John Ryan launched Bailey's Whiskey in the Horseshoe (Shelbourne Hotel)<br />in 1997 - on the fortieth birthday of the Horseshoe Bar. This small article gives another<br />reason for its demise --- said it was because 'people always got it mixed up with Bailey's <br />Cream. This must have been a 'soft' launch sans media as it is my firm belief that an <br />official launch never occurred.</div>

				<div class="content">It is Rare that is for sure. I've spoken to everyone I know in the Industry, some of the most knowledgable people knew almost nothing about it.<br />That said everyone was very curious about it. Jim Murrays tasting note is of particular interest really.<br /><br />An associate of mine put me in touch with the Baileys Archivist she said: <br /><br />They have no record of the number of bottle produced.<br />They source their Irish whiskey from a number of quality distilleries including the famous Old Bushmills Distillery, County Antrim.<br />The whiskey for Baileys was sourced from a number of different distilleries one of which may have been The Old Midleton Distillery, Co Cork. This distillery is no longer one of theirs.<br />In 1998 Baileys launch ‘Baileys The Whiskey’ which used the same blend supplied by Irish Distillers for the Baileys Original Irish Cream.<br /><br />The last time a bottle of it surfaced what price did it fetch?</div>

				<div class="content">In 1997, the innovation team at Grand Metropolitan’s spirits division International Distillers and Vintners were about to extend the franchise of the “Baileys” Irish cream liqueur brand. The idea was to turn Baileys – a cream base containing among other things Irish whiskey – into an Irish whiskey base containing cream, chocolate, vanilla etc. The concept was revealed “exclusively” in the “Irish Independent” newspaper on 12th November 1977. A follow-up piece on 12th March 1988 confirmed that the product – now named as “Baileys. The Whiskey” was to be tested in the Dublin market prior to a wider rollout in Ireland and the UK. Before it could go much further however, “Baileys. The Whiskey” ran into a major obstacle in the shape of the Scotch Whisky Association and the European regulations on spirits drinks. The production method used to create “Baileys. The Whiskey” involved finishing the spirit in casks that had been infused with the key flavouring elements from the “Baileys Cream Liqueur” product. This technique was marginal in terms of its adherence to the EU regulations and while in normal times, the management of IDV would have fought its case these were not normal times. IDV’s parent Grand Met had just merged with Guinness PLC to create Diageo in December 1997 and IDV Managing Director John McGrath was in the Chairman’s seat at the SWA. When it became apparent to the wider business that Baileys were engaged in a whisky project that would push the legal boundaries of the EU whisky definition, there were some rapid and terse discussions. The industry was still absorbing the formation of a formidable new lead player in the shape of Diageo and any row with the SWA over what the Association would regard as a non-compliant product would embarrass John McGrath and potentially tarnish his SWA Chairmanship. The decision was taken quickly and effectively. “Baileys. The Whiskey” would be withdrawn with immediate effect. News of the brand’s demise does not appear to have entered the public domain and in the continuing turmoil that marked the integration of the Guinness and Grand Met businesses within Diageo, the project was quickly consigned to history. It is not certain how many bottles ever made it into the Irish licensed trade but it is likely that this is one of only a handful of bottles still in existence. The distinctive bottle departed from the “Baileys Liqueur” pack although the front label retained a family look with a bronzed landscape. In gold beneath this label is a specially composed ode to the spirit.</div>
