				<div class="content">What's the longest aged Bushmills that was ever available? Is it the 1975? Why don't they release a 30 yr old? I'd love to try something like that. Maybe they think it doesn't age well beyond 21.</div>

				<div class="content">I think the general concensus .... and of course there will be exceptions ... but Irish Whiskey is usually at it's best between the 12-18 year old make. Take Old Comber or even the Tullamore Knappogues ... the whiskey holds up but just about.<br /><br />On the other hand Scotch seems to take a bit longer to mature to it's optimum eventhough their 10-12yo whisky is top notch too but not as complex as older versions. Then go the opposite way not many bourbons are matured past 12years with 7-8 years being fairly average and even quicker still Amurut from India with 4-6year olds coming across as much older whiskey than it's years. It probably is just down to climate and how quick or slow a spirit matures. Will be interesting how the Swedish stuff matures in the long run.</div>
