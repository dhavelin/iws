				<div class="content">Is this a new Power's or just a miss representation of the european bog standard? Although I see it is 43.2% which is a bit strange  <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" /> . Any body got any French it's on sale in LMDW.<br /><br />I want to try it. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.whisky.fr/power-s-6439.html" class="postlink">See here Also</a><br /><br /><img src="http://www.whisky.fr/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/290x420/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/3/m308A.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">I got a couple of bottles if this last year on the whiskey exchange - obviously that was before the exchange rate went nuts. Think they still have it though.<br /><br />Worth a try as far as I recall - slightly spicier take on regular NAS powers. Actually just spotted a bottle open at back of shelf. Will revert in due course.....</div>

				<div class="content">Ok quick comparison of this and a regular irish 40% NAS powers<br /><br />Not sure if my recall was entirely correct - tonight it seems a little more caramel heavy and sweeter, with the potstill toned down a bit. Also seems to be a little darker in colour....<br /><br />Both bottles half full and not sure how long they're open which might or might not be relevant. Anyway not so sure about this one tonight.<br /><br />Time for a powers signature. Curse you Iwc and your questions - I wasn't going to have any whiskey tonight.</div>

				<div class="content">It's non chilled filtered too so you can taste powers at it best. I haven't tried it but would like too. I seen a bottle on display in Midleton's academy house.</div>

				<div class="content">Just checked the bottle again and your absolutely right about the NCF. Can't taste it myself tonight though. That said I had a clear memory of it being a cut above the 40% version. Might just be me tonight. More research required I think. Anyway I'm almost sure it's on thewhiskyexchange still and possible on royal miles whiskies site too, thought with weak exchange rates la maison du whisky might be a better bet. Depending on your French!</div>

				<div class="content">This replaced the previous 40% gold label 6-12 months ago here in Minnesota. I didn't have the foresight to save one of the old bottles for a side by side tasting but I think it is an improvement. Very nice for the price.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm Drinking an old Power's from the early 80's at the minute and its remarkable how well they manage to keep the taste consistent. I Hope to get my hand on one of those bottles and do a Power's tasting. I was disappointed with the Power's 15 I bought last year. It  had damaged to the capsule and the whiskey was tarnished. I like to try another. I'd really like to see them release another and have it NCF too.</div>
