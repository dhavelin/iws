				<div class="content">I have a friend in Spain that I would like to share some 30ml samples of good Irish whiskey with but Anpost says shipping any liquids internationally is forbidden by law. <br /><br />Does anybody knows how to ship whiskey across the EU? Any ideas or alternatives to Anpost?</div>

				<div class="content">Correct AnPost do ban the mailing of liquids and actually specifically mention alcohol as a banned substance to send through the post.<br /><br />However I have always used AnPost for posting samples as they are easy to post and do not raise usually raise questions at the counter when posting.<br />Use small boxes as opposed to envelopes and pack well making sure they do not bang off each other.<br /><br />It's the posting of full bottles that I would not go though  AnPost as you have no cover if anything does go wrong.<br /><br />For full bottles I've used ecoparcel.eu a few times with out any issue and although it is not the fastest service probably the cheapest.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Folks,  <br />I have being trying to find a post which made a comment about the downside of selling rare bottles on international whiskey auctions. If I can remember it said something about generally not getting near the price quoted on auctioneer's valuation.  Has anyone had experience good or bad of this situation.<br />Regards,<br />Daisy</div>
