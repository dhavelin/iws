I mayyy have left a few bottles out because I had got them the previous week, haha..but a few have started to trickle in. Once the entire lot makes its way back to my house in the states, ill get a pic. These are what have made their way in so far.<br /><br />Pudge, I think thats a great idea. Ill have to come up with some reason to toast or share that is within regulations haha. Im sure I can find a few loops holes. There should always be loop holes when whiskey is involved.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Welcome Eli,<br />I think you will have a good homecoming party. Stay safe and I enjoy the whiskey. <br /><br />I remember my first introduction to Bourbon was by some US soldiers in Augsburg PX. Makers Mark left its mark. Good craic all the same. <br />David mentioned Army traditions with whiskey. I remember the lads stationed there were fond of a variety of whiskeys. Scotch was favoured but hopefully things are changing.<br /><br />You'll love the Irishman Cask Strength. Get tour hands on Writers Tears Cask strength if you can.</div>

				<div class="content">GWH,<br /><br />Glad to be here. I only have a month or two left, so hopefully ill be enjoying those sooner rather than later. My whiskey drinking started because of my brother. He is a bourbon nut. His bunker is quite the spectacle. Ive been dusty hunting with him for a few years. When he first started I tried to get into it as well. I enjoyed a few and still do but I ended up having a friend bring me back a bottle of Jameson Distillery Reserve from a trip she was on. She knew I was starting to get into bourbon and assumed, bourbon..Irish whiskey..same thing. After my first pour, I immediately gave up on bourbon and started trying as much Irish as I could. <br /><br />Over my almost 10 years in the Army, Ive noticed 2 things about Soldiers and whiskey. <br />1. The average Soldier claims to &quot;love whiskey&quot;, their favorite pours being either Jack Daniels, Makers, or Jameson.  <br />2. For the average Soldier, Johnny Walker Blue is the be-all and en-all when it comes to whiskey. <br /><br />I have tried to convince and encourage people to taste all whiskeys, learn as much as they can and find something they really enjoy...but most of the time they just want to get drunk  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> Maybe I can start my own tradition though. Start a whiskey club or something. <br /><br />Also, I just found out that Writer's Tears original is available in Canada (I live in Detroit so its an easy trip for me). I will making a trip over as soon as I get back to the states. I did not, however, see anything on the Cask strength being sold there. Do you by chance know if they released it in Canada or might have any plans to in the future? I keep hearing great things about them both (your recommendation included) and it would be great to aviod the international shipping if at all possible.</div>

This usually, but not always, means that once the existing stock is sold out, it will be gone for good.  It's the first time that WT has been carried in Ontario, so hopefully good sales (it is priced well) will mean it gets brought back in the future.  Here's a link to the current inventory across Ontario:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/inventory/searchResults.do?language=EN&amp;itemNumber=271106" class="postlink">http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/inventory/searchResults.do?language=EN&amp;itemNumber=271106</a><br /><br />If you cross at Detroit there are (currently) three Windsor stores that carry bottles.  Whatever store you decide to go to, I would STRONGLY suggest that you call the specific store to confirm that they have stock for sale (as well, if they do have stock, a good location should set aside bottles for you for pick-up at the customer service desk...especially if you explain that you're coming in from a long distance which, depending on the wait times at the border, you may be!).  Good luck with the acquisition when you get back!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /><br /><br />Not sure if the CS version is crossing the pond anytime soon, but I would definitely look to pick up a bottle if the price isn't too ridiculous, relative to the current bottling (i.e. anything over $75 - $80 would start to give me pause).<br /><br />If you're a Scotch fan, there are a handful of distilleries that have comparable pricing to what is carried in the US, in Ontario (Auchentoshan, Bowmore, Glenfarclas off the top of my head).  If you're a Glenfarclas fan, try to get the store where you get the Writer's Tears to transfer in a bottle of Glenfarclas 15 (I know the 15 is not available in the US, and it is likely the best offering in their line-up, making it a great value) for you to pick up at the same time.  There should be no charge for the transfer, if stock is available elsewhere, especially since you will be spending over $130 for the two bottles.</div>
