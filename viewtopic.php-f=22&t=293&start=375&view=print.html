				<div class="content">Hi Adrian, i bought my bottle down at the Midleton Distillery. Dident have a chance to go to Smithfield, but it schuld be ther to.<br />Left Dublin Airport  last Mo.(21,03,11) and the had a good stock of them. But truly i dident see it in any shop douring my tour from south to west. If you get a chance, get it from Duty Free. I paid a good bit more at the Distillery then it was at the Airport. (not because of the Tax)<br />It was a rip off!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /> <br /><br />Slainte</div>
