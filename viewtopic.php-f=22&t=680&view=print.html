				<div class="content">“I can see that some people might think it’s odd that I’ve got into acting, ’cos I always used to get terrible stage fright,” he says. <br />“It got to the point when I was getting through a whole bottle of whiskey during the course of a performance. Not any old whiskey, but Jameson’s Special Reserve! And then I’d be well into another bottle after the gig. I soon found out that that led you to a hospital bed.”<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article6989850.ece">http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/ ... 989850.ece</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">It struck me reading that (not for the first time) that good alcohol is wasted on musicians.<br />I don't understand why, if the purpose is to get mindlessly hammered, these people don't opt for a nice bottle of vodka or Paddy and save their cash.<br />It's like the rappers swigging vintage champagne and cognac in nightclubs. Do they taste it at all? Would they not be equally as happy with a few pints or a bourbon and cola?</div>

				<div class="content">we live in a world where people think they look better if they drink higher quality.  common sense lacks A LOT in the human race, lol.  and also, some people think that higher quality = less severe hangovers.  the only cure for a hangover for me is to not drink that much.  but ive said this before...i usually only have 1 good dram and then move on to bog standards.  peace of mind for me.</div>
