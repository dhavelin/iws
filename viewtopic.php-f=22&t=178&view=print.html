				<div class="content">All you Bushmills afficiandos out there may appreciate a trip to the Duke of York, Cathedral Quarter, Belfast. This bar has a very wide range of Bushmills (not sure how many but definitely double figures) including many single cask bottlings going back many years.<br /><br />It is also the only bar I know which sells Coleraine 34YO by the shot.<br /><br />Does anyone know any other?<br /><br />beeandvee88</div>

				<div class="content">To my knowledge, you've just named three of the earliest four single cask offerings from Bushmills in the modern era (the fourth was a second for Whiskies of the World), Mr BeeandVee.<br />I'd reckon all four of those would be rare as hen's teeth by now, if not their entire stocks consumed or now hiding in collections.<br />I've seen the Downtown Radio and Coke bottlings, but never tasted any of the above. If I were on a serious hunt to try them, likely I'd begin in the Duke of York, actually. He seems to have dozens of different Bushes behind the bar. As for buying a bottle, I wish you the very best of luck, and if you ever hear of two of any of them for sale, do let me know because I'd be keen to grab one of any of these bottlings too!</div>

				<div class="content">Yes - I had both the WWotW bottles at a time - but now drunk.<br /><br />I also believe that Bushmills bottled special bottles for (possibly) visitors to the distillery (going back to early 1990s  - part of a draw - I think and also for presentation to certain parties (e.g. Bushmills bar of the year or Off Licence of teh year - these may have been taken from a Single cask?? There used (again 15+ years ago) to be one of these 'special' bottles in a window in an off licence in Magherafelt, Co. Derry<br /><br />beeandvee88</div>

				<div class="content">Hey JC, if your talking to Willie Jack ask him if he's interested in an old <a href="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Bushmills/Bushmills1784TornLable.jpg" class="postlink">Bushmills Pure Malt</a>. <br /><br />I'm really in 2 minds about this one. Would love to crack it open but would let it go for a decent offer.<br /><br />My issue with opening these bottles is being very dissappointed if they are under par whiskies and would of been better off staying in a collection</div>

				<div class="content">I've got one of similar vintage, IWC. Thirties bottling, I think. My bottle states the proof level in Gay Lussac, and dates the founding of the distillery to 1784.<br />I'm inspired to make a wee diversion down to the Duke next Sunday maybe. Might bring a few quid along with me and see what he's asking for a shot of the Coleraine 34 yo.</div>

				<div class="content">Maybe someone on here could enlighten me about a bottle of Bushmills whiskey that I have and, if possible, let me know if it is a rare bottle. I was presented the bottle about in 1995 and I believe it already was of some age then although I have no idea how old. I have tried to do a bit of research on it but never came across one similar. <br /><br />It is a single malt single barrel whiskey and it is very dark in colour (much darken than any others Iâve seen). The label on the bottle is a dark green with gold lettering and there is a gold panel with some info on it. It says Cask Number: 11756, Bottle Number: 032 (this is handwritten), Strength: 58.2%vol, Volume: 750ml.<br /><br />The bottle came in a presentation box (mahogany-like and lined inside) which has a little brass plaque on it with the same label information engraved on to it.<br /><br />Iâm wondering if this is something that might raise any interest.<br /><br />Thanks for considering.</div>

				<div class="content">Basically a bottle like this I presume<br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Bushmills/BushCelticWhiskey11758.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The colour is amazing and very interesting ... Probably a sherry cask and same era as above <br /><br />This was Distilled in 1984 and bottled in 1996 making it a 12yo so yours is probably a 10-12 year old also. <br /><br />If you could post a picture it would be a great help.<br /><br />However I'm guessing around 150-200Euro depending on interest. It's a pity  really as a bottle like this should realise more but unfortunately the collectablity of Irish Whiskey has not developed in any way as close to Scotch single malts. Best of luck looking for a home for this</div>

June 1996 and is a 10 year old, 1 of 250 bottles.<br /><br />It is afaik a heavily sherried single malt.<br /><br />I'd agree with the previous estimate!!!<br /><br />PM me if you are thinking of selling, many thanks TWB</div>
