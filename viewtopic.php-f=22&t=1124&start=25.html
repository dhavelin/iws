			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>The reviewer says he met a sulphured cask. Not doubting his integrity or anything, but why would a distillery with probably the best cask management policy in the world (maybe) lead them to a sulphured cask? I might even have tasted this one. I suppose we all have different palates.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />It's taken me a whle to digest all that has been happening over the last few days. Between the launch and the on-line reaction it has taken me till now to settle a bit  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Anyway in relation to the 3 single casks that were on offer I will try and offer this insight on it. Firstly we ran a fair bit behind time due to various reasons mainly IDL trying to take care of close to 70 people in 5 different groups. So when we arrived at warehouse (3a I think) which is one of the old original warehouses we were well behind schedule. The 3 midleton Masters Barry Crocket, Billy Leighton &amp; David Quinn  were possibly going to talk about each cask individually but it ended up David Quinn doing a basic introduction to all 3 and then then telling every one to dig in. <br /><br />All samples were direct from cask and at cask strength.<br /><br />The first one I tasted was the 1994 MMP (Spirit Type) MD1 (Cask Type)<br /><br />MD1 stands for first fill Madeira and the MMP which I think stands for Medium Mod Pot but I actually missed the exact definition.<br /><br />I heard lots of people saying a light a floral whiskey but this description is slightly misleading. True this whiskey has a light floral charachter but it was not a light whiskey and such a description is more fitting to Cooley's wonderful Tyrconnell 10yo version. This was surprisingly quite a full whiskey with a big mouth feel and would remind you of a sherry type matured whiskey just with the Madeira taste influence just to give you an indication. Not sure if that is explaining it any better but it is just to let people know it was not a light whiskey in my mind.<br /><br />Next was 1996 LPM (Light Pot Midleton) and Cask B0 (Zero) Basically First Fill Bourbon Virgin oak. <br /><br />These are brand new fill Casks i.e. this wood never held anything previous to the Midleton spirit going in. This to me was a lighter whiskey and full of tonnes of sweetness and vanilla. Again I heard people compare it to Bourbon which technically would be correct but there was definitely a noticeable difference as for my money Bourbon is bigger on sweet but dark sugar type flavours as well as the Vanilla etc. So the B0 would be much more refined except on the finish which Lew from Malt Advocate really enjoyed but I found  quite woody and possibly one of the reasons that they use this very sparingly and probably could never release this on it's own. <br /><br />Lastly was the the 1995 MMP-4 Cask BS2 Again a Medium Mod Pot but the 4 means that it is a much heavier style of Mod Pot that the regular Mod Pot. BS2 is basically a Second Fill Sherry Butt. <br /><br />A few people mentioned the sulphur effect but after tasting and not getting it I tried thinking about it logically. Firstly why would a second fill cask be exhibiting a sulphured trait, obviously it is a distinct possibility especially if it was badly sulphured in the first place and also the cask itself was possibly sourced in the 80's, but did Jameson ever have a sulphur problem back then??? Further I've been lucky enough to have tasted several cask strength samples of the Sherry SPS and one thing I have noticed it that these are very big full on whiskeys and alot of people who would love Jameson 12yo &amp; Redbreast 12yo are very surprised about the taste profile of some of these single sherry cask samples. There is a meatiness to these whiskies that possibly border on sulphur but I didn't really get the sulphur that people were talking about, yes meaty but not so sure on the sulphur. So another question I have to ask, am I mistaking sulphur as meatiness or are others mistaking meatiness as sulphur. I have definitely tasted whiskeys with sulphur and it is not pleasant when it dominates in any sort of way. And as John M says would IDL actually put this out on display so people could report on the sulphur.<br /><br />What has to be remembered is that all these whiskeys will never dominant constituents of an IDL whiskey and are used only as building blocks or for round off. Curiously the BO's are not regularly used in Jameson Gold but not more than 15% of Jameson Golds make up wopuld be BO casks. The Madeira has never been used for anything to date and of course the heavy Sherry Mod Pot 4 would be used sparing too if it was being used at all.    <br /><br />Not sure if that throws any further light on the casks but I'm sure Lew Bryson of the Malt Whiskey Advocate was only writing as he saw it.</div>

Quite strange when you see it for the first time but the 15yo was always too similar to the 12yo so a good thing in my opinion. <br /><br />So the question is is it going to be a new 18yo or something of that ilk? ... and if so what is the colour going to be? ... I'm guessing navy and by the way I have no inside information on this just a guess.</div>

I think as IDL have more and more of these events and the SPS style becomes a bigger business people might be able to begin to understand what is going on in thesr whiskeys. I think it is very curious that this is possibly the heaviest pot still that any of these people may have had a chance to taste and that it may have been a new experience that they cannot easily relate to. What will be interesting is what can IDL do to educate people to this style.<br /><br />The new powers also uses a good bit of Mod Pot 4 and it has a very evident effect on the whiskey.</div>
