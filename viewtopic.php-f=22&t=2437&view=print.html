				<div class="content">I'm fairly new to appreciating whiskey.  Always frank standard Irish bar whiskey (paddy,  jameson,  powers) and never liked it without adding a mixer or hot water and sugar,  until my other half got me a bottle of lagavulin and I couldn't believe it was whiskey,  just so much flavor. <br /><br />Anyway,  long story short I've found jameson select reserve.  Fairly affordable but man is it beautiful.  It's almost sweet. It's the most different whiskey I've drank. <br /><br />It's very different from a lot of the usual favourites like red beast 12, Glennfiddich,  crested ten,  which are all much more &quot;whiskey tasting&quot;  (more fire,  flavours much more subtle) <br />As it's so almost sweet and very flavourful,  how do seasoned whiskey drinkers feel about it?</div>

				<div class="content">I love the Select Reserve. It was a great introduction. I always enjoyed the Jameson 12 but it's got pricey in the last few years. The Select Reserve is good value for the quality. <br /><br />If your treating yourself try the Powers John's Lane. <br /><br />I have a tendency to try lots of cask strength whiskeys so I'm immune to the alcohol burn at this stage but I know what you mean when you mention the burn from some of the others. <br /><br />I do like Crested 10 and Black Bush if your going with budget whiskeys. <br /><br />I noticed you mentioned Lagavulan. It's great stuff. I recently got a bottle of Smokehead. I think it's a budget Ardbeg. Lot of flavour too. It's young compared to the Lagavulan.</div>
