				<div class="content">Hi Luke,<br />At €350 per bottle they can keep it! <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /> That price for a 14yo @ 46% is highway robbery. I think I'll let them get their little IDL bonus out of the way on their own and I'll wait for the general release which will probably be commercially available in a couple of months anyway.<br />This may well go the same way as the Midleton single casks, with every one getting their own version (of the same thing) for sale?<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">Other than the new price point is there anything &quot;NEW&quot; about a 14yr Single Casks?  I don't want to be pedantic but that is more of a new single cask not new SPS?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" /></div>
