				<div class="content">I believe it's out in the next week or two. I know we can all make our own minds up etc. etc. but I can't be the only one who's a little bit curious about what he'll make or the new SPS range. <br /><br />For example, which will he rate higher... Powers JL or Midleton Legacy?<br /><br />What about Writers Tears cask strength? <br /><br />Will Ardbeg or a Buffalo Trace whiskey of some sort come out on top this year? (It'll hardly be anything else)?<br /><br />etc. etc.<br /><br />I've heard some people speculate he'll like the Powers JL - I love it but I have my doubts as to what he'll make of it.</div>

				<div class="content">Irish Blend of the Year - Jameson Rarest 2007 Vintage Reserve<br /><br />I wonder about this, surely the competition should be between drinks released within the year of review? Seems odd that a whiskey released in 2007 should be voted the best Irish blend of 2011 / 2012! Can't say I agree with the choice for best Irish whiskey, as for selecting the Sainsburys release as the best Irish Single Malt, well the less said the better.</div>

				<div class="content">As promised....<br /><br />(96.5) N24 Unmistakeable. Unique. Utopian. Irish pure pot still at its most embracing and magnificent. That bizarre bipolar character of rock hard grain so at home  in the company of silky, molten, honey. Some light, non-specific fruit - a bit like boiled sweets in a candy shop. But a vague menthol note too... T25 As Irish whiskey goes: perfection! The delivery can come only from Irish Pot Still - I have encountered it nowhere else. And it is a replay of the nose: soft, dissolve-on-the-palate honey and elsewhere strands of something much firmer - hardening more and more as it moves to the middle ground. F23.5 Wonderful fade: a distant medium roast Java, the Lubec marzipan which you just knew would be coming; a little caramel; some orangey notes... B24 This is a style of Irish Pot Still I have rarely seen outside the blending lab. I had many times thought of trying to find some of this and bottling it myself. No need now. I think I have just tasted Irish Whiskey of the Year and certainly one of the top five world whiskies of the year.</div>
