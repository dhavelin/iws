				<div class="content">I have been away from home for the last four weeks and also almost with out Internet. The covering of Hurling in the French newspapers are very low to say the least so I have not been reached by the results. I know that sometimes full length Hurling games show up on You Tube or other places on Internet. I wonder if someone could have a look for me for an internet address where I can watch the game. Of course I could search my self but a such search would most likely end up with showing the result as well witch would lower the entrainment a bit. If not a full length game maybe there is something like 15 min highlight?<br /><br />THere is nothing so good as a Hurling game to my Redbreast <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Wouldn't be right to let yesterday's final replay pass without commenting on the fantastic hurling that was played! Absolutely riveting game and I (as a 'neutral' supporter this time around!) enjoyed every minute of it. Well done to Clare and commiserations to Cork who gave them a very good run for their money!</div>
