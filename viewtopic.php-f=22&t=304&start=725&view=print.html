				<div class="content">Excellent comments from IWC... it is only with hindsight that you can understand the journey whiskey takes you on...<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>And this reminds me, it has struck me why Irish whiskey possibly gets a bit of a raw deal ... in instances it's really smooth, possibly too smooth for some palates and something which peat heads cant seem to get to grips with. I know myself as a confirmed peat head I often just want something to blast away the cobwebs like a Laphroaig. But I remember reading a passage from the wise and sagely Mr Michael Jackson that once a whiskey enthusiast gets over the fascination of the peated Islay's they should then explore the the finer points and nuances of non peated whisk(e)y and he specifically mentioned Irish and Lowland Scotch as prime examples of wonderful whiskeys that need to be explored for their subtle but multilayer-ed taste spectrum. So the next time you think a whiskey is a bit too smooth wait for a quite time and sit back and give it your full attention and see if you can get anything extra from it. Learn to enjoy some smooth time  </div></blockquote></div>

				<div class="content">Started with<br /><br />Tyrconnell 10yo AN finish exclusive to The Celtic Whiskey Shop. The more I drink this the more I see this as a little piece of genius. I think there is a need to congratulate Ally on a great selection of cask and a perfect marriage with the Tyrconnell Single Malt. I've always been suspect of strange wine finishes but this is class. Must do proper notes at some stage but all you'll get from me at the minute is class  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />   <br /><br /><br />Finishing with<br /><br />Jameson 12yo Distillery Reserve (Midleton) <br /><br />For me the perfect Jameson 12yo. The regular Jameson 12yo has always been a favourite but since I have opened this there seems to be a gulf between the regular and the Midleton Distillery reserve. In one way that's a shame as the regular 12 has been such a great stall-worth in the Jameson line up and possibly the best value Jameson in the whiskey to euro ratio stakes but the Midlton version (for me) is a clear step above. This bottling however should be treated like special limited series as you can't just pop out and buy another and further it is priced at a much higher premium too so because of this the regular 12 has nothing to prove. Panic attack over  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> .<br /><br />ENjoy which ever you have both are great  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Pete Smoke wrote:</cite>Glenlivet 16 Nadurra 1010K 54.9%. The expected quality, perhaps a spicier batch than previous.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I took a large and healthy sample and then finished this little gem. I did a couple H2Hs with other (previous) Nads' and i think the subtle changes are progressive, less fruit (banana) (and less %age) and more sharp barley and wood influence. Not for the better, imo. The changes are slight though, and for those looking for a bourbon matured CS malt this is still a leading contender, and a favourite.</div>

				<div class="content">They've produced a new plinth with the 4 SPS bottlings - Greenspot, Redbreast 12, Midleton Legacy, Powers Johns Lane - so I guess they're planning on keeping it going fo a while. I suppose it depends on how well they all sell and whether this seperation of Midleton / SPS as a seperate brand from Jameson really takes off.<br /><br />I've noticed that Redbreast, Green Sport and Midleton all previously referred to Jameson and/or Bow St somewhere on their labels. I think there's a subtle effort here to market Midleton as a completely seperate brand at this stage with emphasis on the <span style="font-style: italic">single pot still</span> angle as their answer to single malt. It makes sense when you think about it - most single malts, well Scotch ones anyway, are named after thier distillery.<br /><br />When you look at the new designs for Green spot, Powers John's lane and Redbreast it makes very clear that they're made in Midleton and also explains in much clearer terms than before what's unique about SPS whiskey. <br /><br />So again, I think the Powers Johns Lane will be ongoing.<br /><br />Oh and Barry Crockett said it would when I asked him at Whiskey Live. I probably should have put that bit first.</div>
