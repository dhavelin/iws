				<div class="content">I am originally from Midleton. My father was a Doctor in Midleton and was the Distillery Doctor. Each year he received whiskey from the Distillery which over the years built up to be a reasonable collection of some rare/unusual whiskeys. He passed away 3 years ago. <br />Recently, his family home was broken in to and all of the whiskey was stolen. I have some images representing some of the whiskey but not all. I would really appreciate if members of the society could keep an eye out for any unusual sellers of my fathers whiskey.<br />Much appreciated<br />T.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Tom, sorry to hear about the theft.<br /><br />If you could at least try to list the names of as many as possible it would possibly be more meaningful. Off course more pictures would be great too.<br /><br />The few you have pictures are all fairly common around our circles, bar possibly the Harpers bourbon which looks a few years old. Also the likes go the Johnny Walker and teachers will not be of much value even though they could be over 30 years old. <br /><br /><br />I'm sure we'll keep an eye out.<br /><br />Also contact Ally of the Celtic whiskey shop in Dublin as he could have been contacted in regard to these. He buys and re-sells old whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry to hear of this. <br />I'll keep an ear to the ground too. <br /><br />I'd also recommend contacting Micheal Wilder in the whiskey exchange as handle some of the Irish purchases. <br /><br />They are rare enough to attract attention. I noticed the Hewitts is a 70's bottle. <br /><br />Hopefully they'll be recovered.</div>

				<div class="content">so sorry to hear about your awful loss Tom. As said above, the Celtic Whiskey Shop are a main buyer in this country and if you give Ally a list of what was stollen, he might be able to compare it if he's approached.</div>
