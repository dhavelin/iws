				<div class="content">When did you make the order, they always took a fair few days to complete them out. <br /><br />However it may be the case that they are out of stock and not overly monitoring at the minute. I'm sure someone will get back to you eventually though.<br /><br />However you could try<br /><br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:gift.deliveries@pernod-ricard.com">gift.deliveries@pernod-ricard.com</a><!-- e --><br /><br />No sure if that is an out going mail address only as this is the mail address I got my confirmation of dispatch for my orders.</div>

				<div class="content">out of stock suits me well actually, reason i was mailing was to cancel the order. I didnt realize that shipping was almost 17 euro until i clicked ok on the order!<br /><br />Although its not showing as out of stock on the site.</div>

				<div class="content">I would reconsider if I were you. If you can still make the order it'd great value with the postage. I've been watching them in auctions in Britain and they were going for £80 or so. Last weekend one went for £250+ commission. <br />I think they sold for €65 each + postage. <br /><br />If you don't get one now you may not get again.</div>
