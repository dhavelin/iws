				<div class="content">The Black 43 is discontinued as far as I know. There is a 15 yr. old 'Trilogy' out<br />which as I recall has a black label. Otherwise it's stock that was held over as<br />I did not see it last week @ Tullamore Dew Heritage Centre.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd imagine that it is still discontinued. This quite regularly happens that old stock pops up. I was lucky enough to get some Redbreast blend from a shop in Galway when it was well discontinued for years yet they had it &quot;new2 in stock  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> .<br /><br />If you look at the bottle it is not the new style Tullamore bottle so if it was still being produced I'd imagine they would have updated the bottle. This was also available in 2 retail stores in Galway a few months back. Lovely stuff so grab a bargain a a future collectible quick  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
