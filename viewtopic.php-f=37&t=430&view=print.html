				<div class="content">Folks,<br />The Offaly Branch of IWAI (Inland Waterways Association of Irleand) in conjunction with the <br />Offaly Historical Society are hosting a talk on last year's Grand Crew project (see <a href="http://grandcrew.iwai.ie" class="postlink">http://grandcrew.iwai.ie</a>) covering the &quot;Why we did it, What we did, How we did it etc.)  The talk will cover much the same ground as presented at the society tasting on <a href="viewtopic.php-f=20&amp;t=264.html" class="postlink">1st October 2009</a>.  If you missed it, or if you're outside Dublin, then this might be an opportunity to see/hear all.  You'll also get an opportunity to taste the two expressions.<br /><br />The venue is the Historical Society, Bury Quay, Tullamore at 8pm, 1st March 2010.<br /><br />From <a href="http://www.iwai.ie/diary/index.php3?id=768" class="postlink">http://www.iwai.ie/diary/index.php3?id=768</a>:<br />&quot;This project was developed to mark the 50th anniversary of the Grand Canal’s closure to commercial traffic in 1959, to celebrate the achievements of the boatmen who worked the commercial boats and to promote the restoration of the Kilbeggan Line, the combined muscles of Cooley Distillery, Inland Waterways Association of Ireland (IWAI), Heritage Boat Association (HBA), 107B restoration barge project, Kilbeggan Harbour Amenity Group and the Irish Whiskey Society (IWS); shipped two whiskey casks by canal from Locke's Distillery in Kilbeggan to Dublin for the first time in more than 50 years.<br /><br />Michaels talk will cover all aspects of the project from the original whiskey selection in Cooley’s, Kilbeggan by the Irish Whiskey Society, the transportation of the Casks from the distillery via vintage truck, the travel along the Kilbeggan line by horse and cart, the transfer of the casks onto the 107B Barge which transported the cask to Dublin and on to a celebration with the former Canal Boatmen and the arrival of the casks in Dublin and the official welcome by Dublin's Lord Mayor on the 6th October.<br /><br />The talk will be interwoven with photos and video of the various stages and of course a tasting of the product itself, with both casks represented on the sampling table.&quot;<br /><br />Michael</div>

				<div class="content">Good to hear that.<br />Looks like we might also have Locke's Blend and Locke's 8yo Malt to compare with.<br />Those who are driving can of course still sniff!  Rubbing the whiskey into the hands and having a good sniff really seems to intensify the aromas.<br />Michael</div>

				<div class="content">A good night, I think.  <br />About 40 attendees - a mix of IWS, IWAI, History, People who partook of the events of 29/08/2009 (Kilbeggan Challenge) etc.  4 whiskeys sampled during the talk - Locke's Blend, Locke's 8yo Single Malt, Locke's &quot;Grand Crew&quot; cask 700 and cask 696.  Sadly, I didn't take any scores.<br />We also had a wee video at the end (first-time showing).<br /><br />Zoltan was also presenting tonight - I'll let him give the results of the Hungarian jury.<br />Michael</div>

				<div class="content">Sounds like you had a very good night there Zoltan. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Fair play for spreading the IWS news, etc. Was a poll done on the preferences for the first four whiskeys? Interesting about the Grand Crew poll - has anyone else found that they rated the 700 over the 696 <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> <br />Cheers,<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">i have not asked them about the other 4, but i think they liked the Lockes better<br /><br />700 was my favourite since the first nosing at Michaels house<br /><br />so i can say the Hungarians like 700, Irish like 696 better.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm so pleased both got bottled in the end.<br />They're both idiosyncratically different, yet clearly of the same family.<br />I can perfectly understand those who prefer the 700, as it's certainly more balanced. My oul lad and some of his cronies edged in favour of the 700 too.<br />But for me, the 696 is just so fascinating that I'm drawn back to it.</div>
