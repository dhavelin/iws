I checked the dates in McGuire: the malt duty was imposed in 1785 and finally removed in 1855. In 1801, legislative powers were transferred from Dublin to London. It's a very complicated story in McGuire and I just skimmed it but it looks like even after Union that the rules were not identical in Ireland and Scotland.<br /><br />Something else I just learned from the book: the use of unmalted grain was also banned by the act that introduced the malt duty. Again it's complicated, and distillers &quot;continued to use&quot; raw grain according to McGuire. That implies to me that unmalted grain was used before the malt duty was imposed. And it seems remarkable that the PPS style survived if it was illegal to make.<br /><br />I don't know... there is clearly more to the origins of the PPS style than a malt tax.</div>

				<div class="content">dave, i cant understand why a particular type of still is included in the law. In whiskey making i believe that only a pot still((not refracting types) is an absolute must in whiskey making in order to avoid stripping the flavour out of the product.<br /><br />Could it be that people were using  plain alcohol and doctoring it to resemble whiskeys? I have done just that with burbon and rye.

				<div class="author">by <strong>Mr Booze</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I am late to the party, but recently have been doing some experiments that may help you on your quest.<br /><br />First, that malting the barley will probably have a different flavor profile than adding amylase to unmalted barley.  The reason is that when barley malts it uses proteins to make the rootlet and acrospire which grows inside the barelycorn.  Beer brewers are particularly keen about this because more protein will make a cloudier beer.  However I can't say for sure if the distilling process will eliminate the proteins, so I don't know how much the flavor will change if at all.  I'm very curious about this because I am considering brewing beer that will use malted barley and unmalted grains.<br /><br />Second, that some people claim the water hardness matters but I haven't seen any real side by side analysis.  However, there are pizza makers out there who swear that the sort of water they use to make the dough gives the crust the uniqueness they seek.  Making dough is similar to making beer and whiskey so maybe it is so?  May also be poppycock.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York-style_pizza">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York-style_pizza</a><!-- m --><br /><br />&quot;The flavor of the crust has sometimes been attributed to the minerals present in the New York City water used to make the dough.[1] Some out-of-state pizza makers even transport the water cross-country for the sake of authenticity.&quot;<br /><br />Finally, to make characters with an accent on an American keyboard you hold down the Alt key and type in the numbers correlating the ASCII code.  For example to make é hold the Alt key and type the numbers 0 2 3 3 and the é will appear.  ó is 0243, ö is 0246 (for all you Mötorhead fans). <br /><br />I'd love to hear how this turns out.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey thanks for the input.. Definitely 100% malted barley. Your input  about the NY pizza is true. We also cry about the taste of tomatoes.<br /><br />Well somewhere in my chatter with david i mentioned that i found  the proper pre packaged salts and  minerals to imitate  dublin water.  So for the Irish style beverage it's the dublin salts and the kentucky and burton on trent beverages i will use  my  burton water salts. Naturally  both will be used wit distilled water that has had the PH corrected also<br /><br />Just a note  I'm goilg for a  hip replacemens ib 5 days so ill be healing for a  month or  more.<br />I will not neglect  my Irish style whiskey project<br /><br /> See yall soon<br />Scotty</div>
