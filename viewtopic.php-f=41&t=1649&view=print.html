				<div class="content">Hello Gents, I found this bottle of Jameson laying in an attic label down. The bottle is sealed with pull tab intact.  The bottle has &quot;FEDERAL LAW FORBIDS SALE OR RE-USE OF THIS BOTTLE&quot;  stamped  just above the label.  The label has &quot;To H.M. The King&quot;.  There is part of a N.Y.C. tax stamp still on the bottle.    Any information as to the age and value of this bottle would be appreciated.  Or should I pass it though my kidneys before watering any graves?</div>

				<div class="content">Not 100% sure on this one.<br /><br />However the condition is not the best and better examples have come up in the past.<br /><br />The bottle could suggest 1960's but the Label &amp; Capsule look older. Especially that pull tab. Maybe someone else has an opinion on it.<br /><br />However I'm not sure if getting a spot on age will affect the value of it.<br /><br />A good example from the 60's can be got for under €100 on Ebay. If older maybe in the €100-150 mark but cannot be certain.<br /><br />Of course you often see sellers looking for prices like $500-1000 dollars but they are pie in the sky prices so don't let that colour your expectations.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there I reckon this dates between no earlier than 1937 (Dublin Whiskey appears on label) &amp; pre 1950 (slightly squatter bottle by then) - 1948 Ireland became a republic, so I would date this 1937-1948, value given condition is probably around €150</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your quick response.  This bottle belonged to a Pearl Harbor survivor.  My guess is that he was hiding it from his wife, he was a deacon at his church and they were taught to abstain from all of the good stuff.</div>

				<div class="content">If you'd like to make a few dollars from this I would suggest hanging on to it for a while. Jameson is riding on a crest of a wave but the collectibility of it yet has to really kick in. Hang though a few years and we'll see then. <br /><br />Of course if you open it that wouldn't be the worst thing to do either ... Should be good and interesting.</div>
