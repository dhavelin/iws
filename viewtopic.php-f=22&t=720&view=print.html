				<div class="content">I have tried my first Glenfarclas 105, at Michael S's house tasting last year and loved it, and went back to Hungary and bought a bottle at the whisky shop there, who is the distributor<br /><br />this April i was finally got home a bit late because of volcano... for the first Hungarian whisky show and sit in to 2 Glenfarclas tasting, where the marketing executive Ian A. Mc William presented the whiskys<br /><br />At the first course we tasted 12, 15, 21, 30 years old and the 105, with my winner of the 15 years old<br /><br />At the second tasting (cask strength only <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> we had new spirit (67%), 12 years old refill bourbon (59.2%), 8 years old sherry cask (59%) the 105 again (60%), and a family cask 1969-2009  sherry cask #3188(55.6%), with my winner 105<br /><br />i really like them all, there is little peat in them (1-2 ppm) what you not get in the taste at all, sherry is dominant in all them, and an important role, they have no finish whiskys, they say &quot;make the whisky right the first time&quot;<br /><br />i have looked around here and you can not find a bottle in a shop, and there is no distributor for them, which i think it is a pretty, because it is a lovely whisky<br /><br />is there anyone else like Glenfarclas in Ireland?<br /><br />which one you like and why?<br /><br />and where are you getting your bottles from?</div>

				<div class="content">Leo was kind enough to treat me to a Glenfarclas last year, and I was very taken by it. Wonderfully sherried, the way I like it!<br />I have a Cadenhead bottling open at the moment, which oddly enough is unsherried. It's quite fascinating.<br />Any Glenfarclas I've picked up, I've got from outside Ireland, sadly.</div>
