Sure Irish whiskey is cheap, and to fake bottles, label and fill them might cost too much to be worthwhile? I've opened lots of Italian market bottles from 80s and 90s and never had a problem. <br /><br />There was an issue with scotch. They were faking bottles that didn't even exist and selling it on eBay and other auctions - &quot;rare&quot; scotch. I think it might have just been a couple of guys with multiple accounts, but I'm not sure. <br /><br />There could have been some Irish forgeries too, of course, for all I know. It just doesn't seem it would be profitable.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd totally agree about the Kilbeggan 18.   <br />Here's a though-is it as good as the Jameson 18 or is the Jameson 18 worth €40 more? <br /> <br />On the previous post about fakes. I remember reading some article in The Whiskey Magazine about forged Scottish bottles at auctions, I though is was Italian Irish until I read that post earlier.My memory is failing me.     I'll try find it again.</div>

				<div class="content">That was how they bottled Midleton pre merger but possibly did not stop using it till 1970. <br /><br />How long they used that label prior requires a bit of research.<br /><br />There was a 10year old version too and both were possibly replaced by the very first Midleton Reserve released in 1970.<br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Midleton/MidletonReserve.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Lovely bottle in excellent condition and a good collectable.</div>

Likewise, the recent bottling of Talisker 10YO has attracted criticism.<br /><br />All I'm saying is that if you see a solid vintage from smaller Diageo-run distilleries snap it up, you may not get the chance again:  <a href="http://www.royalmilewhiskies.com/product.asp?pf_id=0010000035186" class="postlink">http://www.royalmilewhiskies.com/product.asp?pf_id=0010000035186</a></div>
