So keeping the initial releases very limited means that they can build hype about the brand being exclusive etc.<br /><br />Haven't tried the Dingle myself, but from what others have said and given that their oldest whiskey can be no more than 5-6 years old, I can't imagine that it's a particularly nice whiskey to drink.<br /><br />Then again, they may just be disorganised and are debating whether to keep more whiskey to age further or whether to release it now!</div>
