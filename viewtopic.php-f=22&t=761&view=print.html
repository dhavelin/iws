				<div class="content">Have mentioned this before but Raymond Armstrong an affable Northern Irish man has an open invitation for people to join his <a href="http://www.bladnoch.co.uk/" class="postlink">Bladnoch web site &amp; forum</a>.<br /><br />Now I'm not advocating people to leave our lovely little forum but you are allowed to join others  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />Anyway the main benifit is to be able to avail of the amazing deals he has on his own independent bottlings of various distilleries as well as some lovely whisky from the Bladnoch distillery it's self.<br /><br />I cannot understate the great value to be had from these Bladnoch Forum bottlings, especially the older bottles and they are of great quality. The majority are bottled at cask strength.<br /><br />Currently he has <br /><br />Highland Park 12yo (1997) @ 50% £27.00 <br />Caol Ila 25yo (1984) @ 54.1% £45.00 (The 30yo is sold out)<br />Glen Ord 20yo (1990) @ 54.4% £37.50<br />Balblair 20yo (1990) 53.7% £37.50<br />Balblair 20yo (1990) 46% £33.00<br />Dufftown 27yo (1983) @ 53.6% £42.00<br />Glenburgie 26yo (1983) @ 53.7% £41.50<br />Longmorn 12yo (1997) @53.4% £38.00<br />Cambus Grain 24yo (1986) @ 52.7% £35.00<br />Linkwood 18yo (1991) @ 52.9% @ £35.00<br />Linkwood 26yo (1984) @ 53.2% @ £44.00<br />Glen Elgin 25yo (1984) @ 41.8% £36.00<br /><br />These are forum member prices so if your not a member you may not see these at first when your in the shop (but I'm not sure) <br /><br />Postage to Ireland is £15 for one bottle or between £25-27 for 2-6 bottles.<br /><br />The only quirk of this site is that you first have to become a member of the Forum and you can chose you User name and password. However you need a seperate user name and password for the shop. These are given to you by the Bladnoch team after your first purchase in the shop. <a href="http://www.bladnoch.co.uk/acatalog/Forum_Members.html" class="postlink">See here</a>  <br /><br /><br /><br />As I spend most of my precious spare time on this forum maybe people can post here as to what is the latest bottling that is available.</div>
