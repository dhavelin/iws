				<div class="content">I've tried he 70 and also feel it doesn't really hang together that well. It's drinkabel enough but I wouldn't get excited about it. Very interested to heat it's Midleton malt in the blend.<br /><br />David's question is quite interesting - does anyone know for certain where the malt in the single malt comes from?</div>

				<div class="content">I actually prefer the 70 over the single malt but yes I agree that the Rare Cask strength is a bit of a rip off. Great whisky but 125Euro for an no age statement cask strength whiskey is a bit rich. And a limited edition of 2000 does not exactly  make it super rare or premium in my opinion.</div>

A rich spicey sherry cask which I enjoyed immensely.<br /><br />I have returned to the Kilbeggan 15yo tonight ... I must admit te nose on this whiskey is lovely and actually reminds of a Bushmills malt for some reason even though it is a blend. The taste even though fairly good is no half as rewarding. ANd the finish is very dry n early too dry.<br /><br />I can see why this has got great reviews but not sure if it would appear in my top ten Irish Whiskies. And for â‚¬95 a bottle it's a high hurdle to clear.</div>

				<div class="content">Another thread that can often be found on whisk(e)y or bourbon discussion boards.<br />What are you drinking tonight? Where are you drinking it? Who with, or are you enjoying a few half-uns in your own company? Why are you drinking that particular drop?<br />Let us know!<br />I'll kick off. Tonight I fair demolished a wee dram of the Connemara cask strength, which was all the more enjoyable for doing so with my recently acquired in-depth knowledge of how Connemara is put together, thanks to Noel Sweeney's brilliant Connemara tasting that he did for us earlier this year.<br />I'm taking a break from the smoke with a Jameson Signature reserve, but it's still not really very impactful for me, I'm afraid.<br />So next up will be a second go at the new whiskey from The Hot Irishman lads, The Writers Tears. First time around it didn't bowl me over, but the packaging is impressive and both the nipper and the mrs both (separately) exclaimed &quot;That's the best name for a whiskey, EVER!&quot;, which it probably is.<br />Anyhow, enough about my drinking. Tell me, what are you having yourself?</div>

North Port 20yo from the &quot;Rare Malts&quot; selection - distilled 1979, bottled 10 years ago in October 1999, 61.2%vol  The only reason I mention it is that while not focusing at all on the whiskey, I got an incredible taste of pure cinnamon bark in the mouth.  Wonderful!<br />Other than this one-off burst of cinnamon, the whiskey is unremarkable and not worth seeking out.<br />Michael</div>
