				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />We will basically have our own stand at the event and are looking for members to man it for the day.<br /><br />The criteria is that you have to be a fully paid up member of the Irish Whiskey Society, you are attending the Whiskey Live and are willing to explain to people stopping at our stand what we are all about. Just to be clear, all members including committee members will be paying for entry into the event, so unfortunately no free entry for your efforts  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /> .<br /><br />We will have little flyers done up and have a pre-prepared fact sheet so you don't have to make it up on the spot. We hope to do this in shifts of 1 hour and have 2 people per shift. So basically we are only asking for 1 hour from any volunteer. I would imagine the last 2 hours may be quieter that possibly the first 3 so if you want to take a breath from the whiskey please feel free to put you name down and let us know what your preferred hour would be or if you are flexible.<br /><br />So far<br /><br /><br />2pm-3.00pm Stephen Young<br /><br />3pm-4.00pm Leo Phelan<br /><br />4pm-5.00pm <br /><br />5pm-6.00pm Adrian Phelan<br /><br />6pm-6.30pm Adrian Phelan<br /><br />6.30pm-7.00pm Martin Bolsinger</div>

Ye both can do the same hour if ye like and then between you both ye can wander off and back as ye like as I'll be there for the full hour anyway.<br /><br />Don't forget to wear your IWS shirt (if you have one). <br /><br />As a general thought it would be good for all members who have an IWS polo shirt to wear it. Not from a point to advertise the society but because you may get special treatment at the stands  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay so far the schedule of person manning stand.<br /><br />2pm-3.00pm Stephen Young<br /><br />3pm-4.00pm Leo Phelan<br /><br />4pm-5.00pm<br /><br />5pm-6.00pm Adrian Phelan &amp; COG <br /><br />6pm-6.30pm Adrian Phelan<br /><br />6.30pm-7.00pm Martin Bolsinger</div>

				<div class="content">Well done to all who covered our stand at the show on Saturday. <br />Very nice setup and hopefully Gary got his TV back home safe and sound! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />The poloshirts worked a treat as well, because I seemed to spend most of my time explaining who we were and where people could get more information about the IWS!!<br />Here's to an even better WhiskeyLive 2012! <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes big hand for all who jumped in. Turned out that there was plenty of Green shirts around and I think it was well covered all through the day even if some people did not know how to sign someone up ... thanks Martin you were my saviour  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> .<br /><br />Here is what the stand looked like<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">
