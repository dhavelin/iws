And on examining the pics I think it has been bottled at 46% which is excellent.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure but I'm led to believe that it is a limited run of 2000 bottle so people will need to get going on this.<br /><br />I like the hemp style packaging too ...<br /><br />have a drool over this  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Ah now Christmas has nothing on this. This is better than a second coming. We had the awesome 21 year old in 2013, great but pricy enough to exclude many. This is the same price as the regular in a supermarket but is limited and exclusive. <br /><br />I mentioned to some people that the singlepotstill.com site had noting new for months and then out of the blue the launch this baby for the members. They must be taking a leaf out of the societys book and give their members exclusive bottlings. I'm looking forward to more.</div>
