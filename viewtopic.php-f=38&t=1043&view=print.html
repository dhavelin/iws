				<div class="content">Is the Society able, or willing to give a talk on whisk(e)y in a club and how would you want to organise it?<br />I am a member in Malahide Yacht Club who hold regular talks on a Wednesday evening and this would be a super subject.<br />Friday's would also be a possibility.<br /><br />Alan Davidson</div>

				<div class="content">I think that is a very real possibility Alan but it is something you'd need to discuss with some of the committee members at the next tasting. It basically is down to peoples willingness and availability to do such a talk as it takes the committee quite a bit of effort as it is to get the monthly tasting together. However it is something that they would look very favourably at as we want to increase peoples awareness of the whole category of whiskey as opposed to your usual down the pub. Fair play for suggesting it as we also we need people to be proactive in such things and just by airing the question shows just that.    <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I've done quite a bit of public speaking, mainly on historical subjects. If you come up with a &quot;standardized&quot; presentation, approved by the Society, I would love to speak on it on this side of the Atlantic.</div>
