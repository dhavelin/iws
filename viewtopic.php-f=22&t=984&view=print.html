				<div class="content">I was highly disappointed to read the whisky guide in the latest Observer food monthly magazine.<br /><br />Here it is: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/12/christmas-best-whisky-guide">http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/ ... isky-guide</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In brief, the writer reckons that no Irish whiskey ought to be considered one of the ten best drams for Christmas. Furthermore, he actually recommends some very dubious drams altogether, making me suspect that the criteria was perhaps influenced by the advertising department (Sainsbury's Single Malt and a Bailie Nicol blended Scotch made the top ten, believe it or not.)  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />But it is the errors that annoy me most: in the printed article, Caol Isla 12 year old <span style="font-weight: bold">unpeated</span> single malt was described as 'a complex mix of shortbread, <span style="font-weight: bold">smoke</span> and spice'.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  This has been dropped from the online article in favour of a Linkwood.<br />Compass Box's Hedonism is described as 'a pioneering whisky' - because presumably no one ever blended grain whiskies before now.<br />The one non-Scotch included is the Nikka Yoichi 10 year old, which is outrageously described thus: &quot;Like English sparkling wine, Japanese whisky has come a long way in the last few decades.&quot;  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  As far as I'm aware, only one English sparkling wine  has ever won any sort of award whatsoever.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  And the genre didn't even exist as recently as two decades ago. Japanese whisky, by contrast has a lineage of nearly a century and has been very highly regarded for decades, winning many spirits awards all over the globe.<br />Worst of all, according to the author, whisky is a spirit that 'only really comes into its own in the dead of Winter.'  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />This sort of trash in a mainstream newspaper is quite upsetting to me. One yearns for the days of Michael Jackson, who was all of Fleet Street's go-to guy on matters beer and whisky. <br /><br />If it's advertorial, they should admit so. Rather than hide their flagrant errors online, they should instead own up and correct them. This is shoddy journalism and shoddy editing. And it ill serves the reader. I feel really sorry for any Observer reader who might go out and buy almost any of these whiskies based on this article. With only two exceptions that I can detect, I suspect they will be let down and will not return quickly to whisky again. But perhaps that's what the author intends, since they believe that whisky can only be properly enjoyed in the depths of winter.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /></div>

				<div class="content">Jim,<br /><br />Not a great guide, perhaps, but I'm rather fond of Bailie Nicol Jarvie so wouldn't have too many problems with its inclusion.  The absence of Irish, US and indeed Canadian bottles is rather glaring.  David Williams is a wine writer and I think the article betrays that.<br /><br />All these things are subjective, of course, but The Independent (London) did a &quot;Scotch top 10&quot; about two years ago which was probably more on the money (and also included Bailie Nicol Jarvie!) but it was chosen by Charles MacLean, who is a well known whisky writer:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/the-ten-best-scotch-whiskies-1488408.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style ... 88408.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There is an article on Irish whiskey just up on the Guardian website which is not bad (I've cross posted it elsewhere).<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/mar/16/irish-whiskey-st-patricks-day">http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/ ... tricks-day</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Observer published a very good supplement on whisk(e)y in 1994 to mark the 500th anniversary of the &quot;Friar John Cor&quot; reference.  It included articles from Jim Murray and Michael Jackson.  I had it for years but lost it.  It may be in the Guardian/Observer archive but I haven't gone looking.  JM used to write fairly regularly in the Sunday Telegraph but not for a while.<br /><br />Liam</div>
