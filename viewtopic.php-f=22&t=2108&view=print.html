				<div class="content">Hey all, <br /><br />does anyone know any pubs in Cork city that bonded whiskey from the old Cork city distilleries (any of them)-- similarly, if there's any paraphernalia connected to North Mall, Watercourse, etc I'd be very interested as I'll be heading down that way with Ove to take a few photographs of what's left from the city's distilling years. Similarly, anyone know if any of the distillery buildings are extant besides the North Mall distillery-turned-bottling-plant? Brian Townsend seems to have tracked down a scrap of the Green/Blackpool distillery lingering around a housing estate, but that was in 1997 so I'm not sure that it's still there. Thanks!</div>

Unfortunately they don't make it any more. <br />I found 3 bottles after Christmas. Good stuff. Hopefully they'll start making it again. Small batch Gins are catching on.</div>
