				<div class="content">It's a good article to let people know a little about Irish whiskey. It's biased towards IDL as they organised it by the look of things. <br />There's a token mention of Walsh and Dingle but I'm assuming that's because Bernard is the Irish Whiskey Association chairman &amp; Dingle for tourism. <br />The history is according to Midleton too.<br /><br />It's good to see Fionnán's book get a mention although I thought it was going to be a review but I bet they didn't even read it. <br /><br />It's an advertorial simple as that. I wish it was more independent and in depth but hopefully readers will find it interesting enough to explore Irish Whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">Just to note ,that my comment  &quot;you pay the piper and call the tune&quot; refers to the  report which has appeared in print in all media over the last few days and which was commissioned by Wild Geese Whiskey. They are  clearly still smarting from the termination of their supply contract by Beam and seem to think that they have a natural right to be supplied with product.  It must have been bruising to have their case thrown out by the EU, but reading the findings especially para15,I don't see that they ever had a case. read here...... <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/dec_docs/40083/40083_85_7.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitru ... 3_85_7.pdf</a><!-- m -->  <br />One line in the  report ......&quot;There are a number of significant barriers to entry in Irish whiskey distilling, including the mandatory three-year maturation period before the product can be sold&quot;   are they suggesting that  something less than 3 years old should be called Whiskey?</div>

				<div class="content">Wild geese certainly have a good PR agency working for them reviving this report that first saw the light of day back in November. The report should be seen in context and read alongside the E.U. commission findings that I referred to in an earlier post. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/dec_docs/40083/40083_85_7.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitru ... 3_85_7.pdf</a><!-- m -->    . I certainly commend the new distilleries and admire their courage in starting enterprises with such a long pay off time . I do not have a problem with them sourcing product to gain brand recognition .However I do have a problem with dodgy provenance and fantasy labeling. A case in point being Kinahans LL &quot; A forgotten Dublin Whiskey&quot; which gives its address as 6/9 Trinity street Dublin, the Hot Press team must wonder how the call centre located  opposite their offices morphed into a distillery in the last year , even the parent company, London Alcohol Co's address is a mailing service!<br />Peter Mulryan's excellent blog refers to the dubious labeling of some brands and puts the case far better than I could.............<br />&quot;On the down side there are more misleading spirits than ever out there – products saying they are from one place, yet are made somewhere else; distilleries claiming to be in places they are not; even whiskeys claiming to come from distilleries that simply don’t exist. These cowboys (and cow girls) are playing with all our futures. Provenance is quite possibly our strongest hand, fake Provenance starts a relationship with the consumer that is based on a lie. You can sell just about anything once, but our industry can only survive on repeat business. At the core of that pact is honesty. Honesty in what we make, honesty in where it is made and honesty in how we package and sell.<br /><br />There are plenty (too many) examples out there of misleading labeling, but let me pick just one so blatant it made my eyes water:<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Peter Mulryan is so right in what he says. I completely agree with<br />his sentiments. As an industry which is so important to the Nation<br />I believe that Central Govt. in conjunction with the Irish Whiskey<br />Association has to be ruthless in the extreme to prevent the industry<br />being contaminated by a few. As a nation we already have many shining <br />examples from the Celtic Tiger era in other areas. The 'made in Waterford'<br />is a shining example of a tangible that can be investigated!!</div>

It's €29/30 in supermarkets and that's too much for it. A 3 year old blend that's nothing special is worth less than €20 in reality. The Pogues name add the 50% I guess. <br /><br />I'd like to be the one who sold it all the same. €75 is excellent. It's takes 2 to tango, so there another out there who went to €73. If they're reading this, I'm sure if they send out a plea for assistance to getting a bottle someone here will help for a nominal fee. I can't for personal reasons but I'm sure someone will.</div>
