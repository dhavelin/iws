I'm a room temperature man too.<br /><br />I tend to think of it like beer. The worse it is the colder it need to be to drink it. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  I don't think I need to cite examples.</div>

				<div class="content">Don't like them to be honest and would of thought they were a bit of a gimmick only for the fact they are still around after a few years so possibly some are buying them. I usually only use ice in heavy bourbons on a sunny afternoon in the garden after a BBQ accompanied by a cigar when I like the addition of the extra (melted) water. I found when using those rocks I tend to get that tooth cringe feeling from them like some people get from nails on the chalk board any time they slide down to the glass when drinking. Further when your at the end of your drink they can smack you in the mouth <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  and whiskey also adheres to them so your losing a tiny amount of whiskey every time you use them and finally I think they look alien in a glass of whiskey  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> .<br /><br />There are cheaper ways anyway, go to the beach and pick up some free stones boil, soak and wash (dishwasher maybe) them a good few times to get the salt out. Another way is just freeze your glass or get glass marbles and freeze those ... same effect.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Stephen,<br />like a great many things in life it is personal taste whether or not to chill whiskey. I however would not ! Cocktails are a different matter however but real ice would be the only choice to consider then. Also don't you feel they look grossly unattractive ? They will never grace my glassware !! Or is that disgrace  <br />Rachel.</div>

				<div class="content">I was gifted these and tend to use them a couple of times during each summer. There are hot days where I crave a chilled bourbon, but I find that even a little watering down that comes from ice ruins most bourbons for me. So these come in handy.</div>

				<div class="content">Have to agree with the &quot;room temp&quot;  drinking of whiskey. Have been told that ice kills alcohol, so another reason to not put it in.<br />Have had 10 YO Bushmills that had been chilled to nearly freezing, different without any additional water.<br />And yes, the rocks do look horendous.</div>

I could see it working a bit for bourbon alright but I tend not to drink that too often ...<br /><br />I don't intend getting a set, they'd unbalance the feel of the glass in my hand and more than likely would probably damage the glass</div>
