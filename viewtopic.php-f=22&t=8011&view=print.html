				<div class="content">Hi Guys,<br /><br />I'm new to this forum also new to premium whiskey<br /><br />my first real tasting of  whiskey was jameson  black barrel, and i really like it since then been looking for more whiskeys i might like <br />been reading up about 'Midleton'' and if i should buy a bottle or not. well i did buy one in the end a Midelton very rare 2016. And oh boy its so nice i could drink it all day long.  and that's where the problem is i will end up drinking the whole bottle within no time. <br /><br />My question is what other brands are out there that maybe come close to midelton for not such a high price per bottle. ( is there such a thing)<br /><br />i'm not really into bitter/harsh taste i have a bit of a sweet tooth also i like smooth whiskeys  so looking for advice on other brands out there that may keep my expensive taste down.<br /><br />hope this was not to confusing<br /><br />regards</div>

				<div class="content">As always my go-to answers for those starting out is <br />A. Don't buy a cheap whiskey.<br />B. Buy a bottle of Redbreast.<br />I am no aficionado but these are just my thoughts. Enjoy.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_salut.gif" alt=":salut:" title="Salut" /></div>
