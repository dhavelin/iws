I think I might also have seen a 1L bottle but I'm not certain. It was just called Old Irish Whiskey but it had a 12 on the label. The &quot;red label&quot; is just to distinguish it from all the other 12yos. I don't hold out much hope of another one at this stage, but I  do remember that it was a lovely whiskey.</div>
