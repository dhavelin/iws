				<div class="content">I saw this in an article about the current electricians' strike that has been affecting large companies like Irish Distillers:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Midleton plant employs about 100 people and produces about 50 million bottles of whiskey per year.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Just thought that was an interesting data point, though it's not the usual industry metric (which would be 9-litre case equivalents). I recall that IDL is shooting to sell 3m cases of Jameson per year, which would be about 36m bottles, I suppose. The other 14m bottles must then be Tullamore Dew, Powers and Paddy. Does that sound right? I wonder if they are counting the grain spirit they make for Bushmills.</div>

				<div class="content">I forget where I heard it but the last report I heard was that the Midleton output was circa 19 mla's but that probably is out dated due to their agressive targets which seem to grow every year . Don't know how you can accurately calculate this though in 40% 70cl bottles. This is totally unconfirmed of course.</div>

But 19mla = 2,111,111 9-Litre case equivalents.  So that figure must be out of date, or do we know if output figures differentiate between theoretical max. grain production vs. malt/pure pot still production??</div>

				<div class="content">Just to let you know that I think when they use the term MLA (Million Liters of Alcohol) it is not what is bottled but what is produced off the stills. i.e. before it is reduced and put in cask. Colm Egan said something along those lines but In missed it. Or possibly what goes into to cask. SO there maybe a greater scope there.</div>
