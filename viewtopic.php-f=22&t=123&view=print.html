				<div class="content">Okay, paper was really tight this week and the Slane interview got slashed to bits. Apologies to anyone who bought it hoping for 2 pages about whiskey!<br />I spoke to Henry Mountcharles, who writes a column for our daily sister paper, and he told me the following:<br />This has been in his mind to do for years, because 'you can't download spirits' and because his son Alex used to work for IDL so they know the industry a bit.<br />The aim is not only to capitalise on the Slane name in the US, but to go after the Irish-American market - the Jamesons market.<br />The whiskey is a blend (wouldn't tell me the age, but thought to be 7 to 9 yo), made by Cooley and to be distributed by Capstone throughout 10 East coast states. It launches in New York on July 1st, but will be for sale earlier at Slane in the grounds during the Oasis concert.<br />It'll retail in the US at around 25 to 30$ a bottle, going head to head with the cheaper Irish whiskeys. Capstone want a premium Slane whiskey further down the line, so planning is already underway on that, and there's talk also of a Slane castle microbrew beer.<br />The branding and marketing will go on the back of the rock angle - the slogan is 'Slane Rocks!' and there is a tie-in with Red Bull to launch a whiskey and red bull cocktail called the 'jumpstart'.<br />According to Henry, one (unnamed) NYC based spirit critic tasted it blind and rated it higher than Jameson 12 yo, which is perhaps a little fanciful, I don't know.<br />So we're talking big run, big distribution, decent price point.</div>

				<h3>Slane Castle Irish Whiskey</h3>

				<div class="author">by <strong>TheWhiskeyBro</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hi just got my hands on the Slane Castle Irish Whiskey (Finest Premium Blend)<br /><br />Currently only a limited amount of pre-release bottles available in the CelticWhiskeyShop priced at €29.99<br /><br />To be officially launched on the 1 July 2009 in New York, and previewed in the VIP area at Slane.<br /><br />However the CWS is expected to stock this going forward (afaik).<br /><br />This is a blended Irish Whiskey, 40% abv, no age statement (batch L9073) aimed primarily at the US market.<br /><br />On first view it seems to be quite dark compared to other blends so it possibly contains a higher caramel content,<br />at this price point it is also likely to have quite a high grain content. Targeted at newer/younger whiskey drinkers.<br /><br />Will open it tonight and post some preliminary impressions and basic tasting notes over the weekend.<br /><br />Anyway always exciting and welcome to see a new product on the shelves  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
