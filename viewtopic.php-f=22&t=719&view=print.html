				<div class="content">I'm currently doing some research on Redbreast, like JC I also have a bottle similar to the one you've shown. Jim is correct in saying that the label on your bottle was still in use up until 1972.<br /><br />However my own research into the various Redbreast bottling's suggests that your bottle probably dates from 1963 to 1964. <br /><br />I'd be very interested in checking out the markings on the base of the bottle you might find something like IGB118-2 LXIV... let us know and it might help!!!<br /><br />As regards value, a bottle similar to this in perfect condition in todays market would be worth around €200-€250,<br />however in poor condition and without the seal and even with the cork apparently intact, I'm afraid it is of little value to collectors. If the contents are genuine some enthusiasts may be prepared to offer upwards of €50 euro for the bottle to try the contents. However if you are a whiskey drinker yourself I'd recommend you open and enjoy the taste and style of an Irish Pot Still Whiskey in the 1960s.</div>
