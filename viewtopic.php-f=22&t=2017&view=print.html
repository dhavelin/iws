The €35million state of the art distillery, which opens in 2014, will bring whiskey production back to the town of Tullamore exactly 60 years since the original distillery closed in 1954.<br /> <br />The ceremony will be conducted by Minister Simon Coveney with William Grant &amp; Sons’ Chief Executive, Stella David.</div>

But I have heard that it may also be available in Tullamore Dew Visitor centre at some stage but don't quote me on it ... also I would not be surprised if Ally got some in but other than that I say the options will be very limited.<br /><br />Seemingly the blend has been finished in sherry casks and is very well married in my opinion and does not feel like a finish but more like sherry matured used in the blend which is great. Very drinkable and compared to what else is on the market in that vein not bad value at €50.<br /><br />Thanks for the thumbs up too ... however just to let you know I am not updating it any longer due to time constrains from work and family, but hopefully it will still provide some use for even if it is well out of date at this stage.</div>

In that, it's similar to the Black 43, which had pot still finished in sherry for 1 year.<br /><br />I like the new Phoenix very much.<br /><br />I had my first taste of the 12yo sherry finish single malt recently. It wasn't under lab conditions but I enjoyed it. I'm not the biggest fan of sherry finishes so it was a pleasant surprise. I'd have to sit down with it properly to confirm that though.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the clarification David. I don't pay as much attention as I used to so was not sure. <br /><br />I tried the 12yo single malt also and was not as impressed as I was with the Phoenix. The 12yo Malt was actually cheaper but I went with the Phoenix.<br /><br />Any idea of whiskey ages in that?</div>
