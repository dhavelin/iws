				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />I'm Alan Anderson of <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.whiskycomedian.com">http://www.whiskycomedian.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I am bringing my comedy show Whisky For Dafties to the Galway Comedy Festival 25-27 October. I'm looking to do a couple of other gigs around these dates.<br /><br />Can you please recommend some good whisky / whiskey bars with function rooms in between Belfast and Galway where I can stop off and do perform show.<br /><br />Many thanks Alan<br /><br />This is the flyer for my recent Edinburgh Fringe show - it sold out most nights.<br /><br /><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7bc1mfUxS1qhhvh9o1_500.gif" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Dublin is probably your only option ... However mixing your show with a whiskey venue may prove difficult on 2 fronts. <br /><br />1. Most whiskey bars are not really set up for live gigs. Unless you are going for intimate. <br /><br />2. There is an ashamedly small legion of whiskey heads in Ireland so your audience  may be hard to find. <br /><br />where are you playing in Galway by the way?<br /><br /><br />Edit ... Now that I think of it ... Check out the Irish whiskey trail for possible locations.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the feedback so far. Doing a gig for the society sounds like it might be fun, however the show is a comedy show more than a formal tasting and as such is aimed at a youngish market or those with little or no whisk(e)y knowledge who would like to know more. I have a feeling you guys will have a bigger knowledge base than me. <br /><br />That said, many Scottish distillers and brand managers have been very supportive of my gigs by giving me lots of rare stock and more importantly their time and knowledge. Jamie Milne from Glenfiddich, Jan Beckers from Douglas Laing and Ian Logan from Glenlivet in particular. Michael Morris from Cooley (now at Belfast Distillery) is also a big fan.<br /><br />Galway gigs are at the Roisin Dubh pub.  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.roisindubh.net">http://www.roisindubh.net</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'm also doing a gig Hudson Bar in Belfast either on the way to Galway or the way home. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://hudsonbelfast.com">http://hudsonbelfast.com</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Six malt whiskies to be tasted, many laughs to be had.

Just to let you know our usual room only caters for around 40. <br /><br />I think also if you were to do somewhere else it would probably need to be Dublin which is probably just as handy a route from Belfast to Galway as Any as cross county from Belfast to Galway is a bit of a trip and if your doing it by public transport then it will probably mean at least a couple of buses to organise.</div>
