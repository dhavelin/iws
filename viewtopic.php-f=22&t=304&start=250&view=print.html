				<div class="content">Did a stock take last week after clearing 3 bottles (don't worry they were very empty) and the count was 89  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  So just to even everything up I opened a  New bottling of Blackbush tonight.<br /><br />After a lap QC you could be forgiven for thinking (if you listen to a scotch malt enthusiast anyway) that it would not stand up. Well I have news  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />The nose is quite evident... lighter than I've remember but more malty and lighter fruits but not neccessairly less evident ...<br /><br />I have to conceed that the mouth feel is much lighter .. possibly watery even at the start but not weak ... after the intitial lightness the flavours reveal themselves even more and there is a great spice finish which is really excellent and it drys out and it quite long. I must have one of these tomorrow on it's tod to make sure it still is a top buy.</div>

I'm enjoying one right now!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br />The consistency, quality and value is superb.

				<div class="content">Tonight I'm doing a head to head of 4 Midlton 12 yr olds - Powers, Redbreast, Jameson and a Jameson &quot;Distillers Selection&quot; with a cream label.<br /><br />I thought the Redbreast would be the clear winner but to my surprise it's the standard 12yo Jameson. Out of the 4 it's got the clearest pot still and is more spicy than the others which all seem a little flatter. I'm wondering though whether it's someting to do with the fact that the other 3 have been open for a while, while this one wasa freshly opened tonight. They're all about 3/4 full and I've never noticed a change before.</div>

				<div class="content">Started with a large Redbreast 12yo and what a great drop, had a quick nip of the 15 in the middle just to compare and  yes the 15 is still a long leap up but the Rb 12 is a top notch whiskey. Now on Laphroaig 15yo which is possibly one of the lightest Laphs but the Redbreast is in now way is over powered by this islay which is a nice favourite of mine also.

I always thought that the nose was amazing but the tastw was possibly a bit light. Maybe my taste buds were too used to stronger whiskey's but tonight it seems that the flavours have revealed themselves for the first time. The strange thing is I have a blocked nose and not getting the nose or finish as well as I should but I've detailed these before. <br /><br />Taste:  Toffee and Coffee, dry gin &amp; spice and ginger ale.<br /><br />Quite yummy actually ... maybe it is down to the fact that I'm not drinking much these days.
