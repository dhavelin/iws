				<div class="content">I came across a site 12 -18 months ago and it was a virtual replica of the Wild Geese site with the only difference that it was called The Wild Geese Irish Soldiers &amp; Heroes and the labeling of the exact same whiskey reflected that also. I was curious as to whether they we already thinking about a label change from their newly launched line up. I have no idea how I found it in the first place as it did not show up on google searches for Wild Geese. I save it however and would go back to it every so often just to see if it was still there. I also contacted their head office in relation to this but never got a reply back. <br /><br />However I have now come across it again but this time with a google search and it seems it has been launched as the North American site version of <a href="http://twgisah.com/TheWildGeese.html" class="postlink">Wild Geese</a>.<br /><br />So key an eye out you guys over in the US and Canada</div>

				<div class="content">Wild Geese was the only Irish whiskey to be found in Cambodia when I was there recently.<br />It does seem to reach markets that others, apart from perhaps Jameson, haven't even considered.<br />I presume the name change was to help explain who the Wild Geese were to those of us without a doctorate in Irish history.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br /><br />   I did a little searching on the net this morning and found a couple of places here in the U.S. that carry <br />&quot;The Wild Geese Irish Soldiers &amp; Heros Irish Whiskey&quot;.  If I'm not mistaken, this Whiskey is a COOLEY<br />product.  It would appear that the &quot;RARE&quot; expression of this Irish Whiskey is most liked.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.drinkupny.com">http://www.drinkupny.com</a><!-- m --> has it on sale for $49.00 a 750ml.  If &quot;The Wild Geese Irish Soldiers &amp; Hero's&quot; Irish Whiskey ever makes it way to New England, I'll give it a try!  Thanks for the &quot;heads up&quot;.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br />The Wild Geese Irish Soldiers &amp; Heroes is, as you correctly thought, 'The Wild Geese Irish Whiskey' but has been launched with a slightly different name in the U.S. Please visit The Wild Geese's new Facebook page to find out what The Wild Geese is up to:  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thewildgeese.isah" class="postlink">http://www.facebook.com/thewildgeese.isah</a>   This is the Worldwide page and linked to it you will also find The Wild Geese Irish Soldiers &amp; Heroes page based in the US. <br /><br />The reason for the name change in North America is that Pernod Ricard have sought, in over 50 actions around the world, to argue that Wild Turkey* (a bourbon) and Wild Geese (an Irish whiskey) are similar and that their average customer would get confused between a Turkey and a Goose. <br /><br />Unfortunately, and uniquely, the US Courts agreed with them. No other jurisdiction has even come close to finding Pernod Ricard on the same grounds and we have been successful in defending our right to bring the Wild Geese to our customers worldwide, despite the huge difference in size of company and resources. <br /><br /> The question has been asked whether we think that Pernod Ricard's actions are linked to the fact that they own Jameson and that they are using this as a means of keeping us out of the market? Obviously we can't comment on that but would leave it to the readers of this blog to draw their own conclusions.<br /><br />I hope this answers your question and if you have any further queries I'd be very happy to help!<br /><br />(*Pernod Ricard have very recently sold Wild Turkey to Campari)</div>

				<div class="content">Yes thanks for posting ... a very interesting turn of events and thanks for sharing.<br /><br />I would reckon it is more corporate Pernod - Ricard (US) pushing this rather than say IDL.<br /><br />A pity really but I suppose it's easy to get a squat square goose and a tall round turkey mixed up on the shelf  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">What are peoples' thoughts about this bottle?  It has made its way to Ontario in recent months, and I am curious.  As a price comparison in Ontario:<br /><br />- Islay Mist 17 is $2 more<br />- Bunnahabhain 12 @ 46.3% is the same price<br />- Springbank 10 is $4 more<br />- Connemara Turf Mor is $11 more<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/details.do?language=EN&amp;itemNumber=339887" class="postlink">http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/details.do?language=EN&amp;itemNumber=339887</a><br /><br />Thank you!!</div>

I wasn't sure.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Thank you for the feedback, my $$$ shall go elsewhere (eventually to Turf Mor and Connemara CS, which are on my top 10 'to get from the LCBO' list) as my preferred profile is something with more bold notes/aromas.</div>
