				<div class="content">Can people who are attending on Thursday make a list of what their ideas are on how the society should work and bring them along on the night.<br /><br />Also can every one bring a pen if possible. It would be handy if people jot down their thoughts as other air theirs. Basically it would be nice to use this like a brain storming session. The more ideas we have the clearer we will know what the majority want. Feel free to be critical as if we don't know what you don't like we can't deal with it. All musings can be handed either named or anonymously.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Adrian</div>

				<h3>Review of IWS meeting 26th March 2009</h3>

				<div class="content">Well a lot of good debate last night and I honestly feel we made good progress too.<br /><br />It was great to have a decent discussion and even though this can get a bit boring it really was required to get stuff moving and get clarity for what is required. The meeting seemed very positive and there were good points and counter points being made all night. However this is just the start and we still have challenges ahead so keep all the comments coming in and hopefully we can get the society up and running fairly soon and give ourselves more time to concentrate on whiskey  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">In a strange sort of way, the old Chinese curse ' may you live in interesting times' might apply here. There is certainly alot of 'interesting' stuff going on at the moment in terms of society protocols, constitutions, bank details, etc, etc and much of this, though absolutely necessary for the formation of any proper institution, could well be regarded as a curse! <br /><br />Bear with it all, help develop it to its potential and maybe even try to enjoy it! It will all stand us in good stead in the long run  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />When we get the formalities out of the way, we'll be able to operate in a more time efficient manner, the momentum built up to date will snowball allowing us to get more done and pretty soon we'll be able to devout more and more time within each meeting to learning, nosing ,tasting and appreciating the finer aspects of the whiskeys that are given the honour of being chosen for a society review.<br /><br />Thanks to all who have put the effort in thus far, it was good to see everyone again and I'm looking forward to the next chapter  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Sl√°inte,<br />John.</div>
