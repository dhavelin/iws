However I found it very enjoyable and tasty. Very different to any bushmills sherry influenced whiskey and much lighter making it a great easy drinking dram.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree it is unfamiliar as a Bush. I found an almond top note that was almost feinty on the palate that I didn't like at all.<br />It also tasted really grainy to me. I got the sugary sweetness you refer to. I have to say, for me this was a disappointing release for their (bogus) 400th anniversary. I've a few bottles in the house, but I'm in no hurry to get through them. I'd rather crack open a Black Bush, I think.<br />But fair play to them, it was an interesting experiment. However, as far as playing with malts go, I think Glenmorangie's been much more successful with their chocolate malt stunt - Signet, is it? I tried that in Glasgow last year and was really impressed.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm interested to read the comments about it not having a familiar Bushmills character. While being quite different from the malts I could see a lot of commonality with the Black Bush. To me it's a significant step up from BB, which I love by the way, a kind of a BB with some extra muscle.<br /><br />Does that make any sense?<br /><br />Has anyone tried it against the older version of the 1608? I did a while back but can't remember the outcome. Must revisit.</div>

				<div class="content">I have a bottle of each open and to be quite honest I have never been a big fan of the original 1608 and for me the new 1608 is far better.<br /><br />Probably a lot to do with it being bottled at 46% which gives it that extra bit of edge over the original.</div>
