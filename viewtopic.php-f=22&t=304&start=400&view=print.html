				<div class="content">Last night I opened up one of my precious Bushmills Sherry Single casks. <br /><br />Distilled 1989 Bottled 2005 53.7% NCF<br /><br />Just sat back and enjoyed it with out too much disecting.<br /><br />Lovely velvety sherry, like sticking your nose into a bag of rasins  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  with a touch of dry wood very nice indeed. <br /><br />WIll be sad to see these particular ones go ... these were the ones that had no front label so you could get your name printed on the label and then stuck on, kind of Orangy tan colour). Got them in Dublin Air Port travel retail in 2005 for 70Euro each if I remember correctly but steadily got more expensive but I suppose the 90Euro CWS charged for their single cask was not too far off the makeespecially compared to single casks now. And David Quinn who is now with Midleton was the man behind these beauties. <br /><br />I cannot understand why these never really caught on in the wider whisky buying public while the hype behind Japanese and even Indian whiskies get very favourable mentions these days. Ahh well in one way it is not a bad thing as it keeps them at reasoable prices in the Auction markets  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
