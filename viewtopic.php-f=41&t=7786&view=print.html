				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />I have managed to get my grubby mitts on a bottle of Midleton Very Rare 1984, one with a special story behind it.<br /><br />It is bottle no. 00071, and is one of the first 100 MVR ever produced. It seems that back in 1984 Jack Lynch was Taoiseach and he came to Midleton for the launch of the new 'Midleton Very Rare' special Irish Whiskey. There were members of the press there for the event, and some local publicans etc, plus a photographer. The first 100 bottles were given out that day to the invitees, and the photographer kept his all these years, and this is his bottle.<br /><br />It is in pretty good condition, given that it is 32 years old. Please see photos below. This bottle did not come with a sleeve or with a cert or invite - as it was one of the first off the line maybe they hadn't got around to that yet?! The photographer (who is now 83 years old!) assured me today that it is just as he got it, all those years ago.<br /><br />Anyway, I am putting it out there to see if anyone is interested in it, if so please PM me.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Jack Lynch I am sure was there but as a member of board of IDL<br />which I believe he was on at the time. He ceased being the<br />Taoiseach in 1979 following the Haughey 'heave'. In fact he was<br />no longer a T.D. I believe.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi John,<br /><br />Thanks for the reply there, good for you on your Irish history - I can't remember a lot of what I did in school all those years ago! Probably Jack Lynch was indeed there as you say, but in his capacity as an IDL director (and a 'former' Taoiseach). I may have misunderstood Eddie when he said 'Jack Lynch the Taoiseach was there for the launch'.<br /><br />Either way, the bottle is from the 1st 100 Midleton Very Rare ever issued, as issued on that day.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Ian</div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately, the bottle number is not an indication of the order of production. It depends on the process and how the bottles move and in what order. The bottle was labelled after it was filled. I could easily be one of the 1st or one of the last filled.</div>

				<div class="content">However, it is a nice bottle given the low bottle number of the 1st VR year.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Hugo,<br /><br />I did say in my note that it was one of the first 100 bottles of MVR 'ever issued', I did not say 'ever produced' or 'ever bottled'. As you say, there is no way of knowing what happened behind the scenes in Midleton in terms of which individual bottles were actually filled first on the production line, even what barrel was opened first (if more than one barrel was involved) etc etc.<br /><br />In fairness, I think all we can go by is the number on the label?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Ian</div>

				<div class="content">Ian,<br /><br />The title of the thread is Midleton Very Rare 1984, one of first 100 &quot;produced&quot;<br /><br />Either way, as I pointed out it is nice to have a low number. To add value, it really needs to be number 10 or less.</div>

				<div class="content">OK, I stand corrected! I did not see that I used the word 'produced' in the title of the post, I should have been more consistent and used the word 'issued' all through the post. Tell you what, before I place my next post on this site I am going to bear in mind the scrutiny it is going to get...<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the PMs, I am going to take this one off-line and follow up with those interested in it.<br /><br />Happy Christmas to all on this site, hope you all get the chance to sample a few nice whiskeys (or whiskys, whatever you favour yourself) over the break. I'll be having a couple of Jameson 12 year olds and maybe a nip or two of Powers Three Swallow, all going well!<br /><br />Regards,<br />Ian</div>
