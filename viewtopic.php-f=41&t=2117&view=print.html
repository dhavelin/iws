				<div class="content">When bottled in 1993 there were originally 396 bottles ---- I got one at the time direct from<br />an IDL rep. costing £316 Irish at the time. Have never seen it in a shop apart from CWS in Dublin.<br />I am unsure whether one has ever turned up on 'Whiskyauction'. Nowadays the price has gone quite<br />high that said still better to have in the portfolio than some old Anglo shares  <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> At present I do not <br />know of anyone with a spare one to offload.</div>

				<div class="content">The Coleraine is probably the most collectable irish whiskey I've ever seen and I've only ever seen a few go in regular auction houses and one in McTears and they always fetch top dollar.<br /><br />I have a feeling you'll be lucky to get one privately and I'd imagine still north or 2 grand  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> .<br /><br />What had CWS it up at?</div>

It was on the independent at the time. The price has increased all in the CWS but he had it for €2500 last year as far as I can remember. I'm sure if you approached him with an offer he would consider it. You said you collect whiskeys too. You'd never know, he may do a past exchange for something you don't want. I've found them very good to deal with over the years.</div>

But once you put 15%-17% buyers premium plus vat you can add nearly another €250 to it.<br /><br />So circa €1800 still not a cheap way to get one.<br /><br />I've still to see one available privately.<br /><br />So getting one for under €1500 may take a while but bide your time and be patient. All things come to those who wait. <br /><br />Best of luck in your quest.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
