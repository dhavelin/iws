				<div class="content">Well we've done one for Midleton. I think Bushmills gets a hard time here sometimes, as they really seem to have pulled they're horns in since Diageo. Still I can remember a time when we gave out (possibly on another (magazine related) forum) about Midleton lack of single casks etc. compared to bushmills.<br /><br />I personally would like to give them the benefit of the doubt - they probably are holding back stock, focusing on key blends and hoping to seriously grow sales. But that's what IDL did with Jameson for many many years and I think without the security and muscle that comes from that we might not have seen what I think is possibly the finest and widest range of pot still whiskeys ever seen, especially from a single distillery.<br /><br />So assuming Bushmills start selling more and more white and black bush and become able to follow suit what would we like to see from Bushmills?<br /><br />Personallt I'd love to see:<br /><br />The 12yo with some Rum Cask malt again - this is one of my all time favourites from Bushmills.<br /><br />The regular 10yo become a reguler 12yo - I think this would add a bit more depth.<br /><br />And a 25yo???<br /><br />And now that I think of it a young / NAS malt would be interesting. (I know this might appear slightly contradictory to my comment on the 10 but i don't think so really - I think the 10 is neither one thing nor the other - it's quite a nice whiskey but I think a little older and a little younger would be more interesting.)<br /><br />Single sherry casks and lots of 'em - always loved these from Bushmills!<br /><br />And the occasional single rum cask - the CWS had some a few years back - really unusual and interesting take on Bushmill. Still have one unopened one - some day!!!</div>

Actually, even more than a new expression or finish, what i'd like to see from Bushmills is an end to this 40% ABV across the board nonsense. Even the very costly Bushmills 21 is bottled at 40%. It doesnt need to be cask strength but its clear as daylight that 40% across the entire lineup is maximum efficiency thinking (especially as its 43% down in south africa to adjust to different laws) and I'd like to see some BM malts bottled around 44-46% etc with maybe a little more for the 21 to give that wonderful madeira texture a little alcohol texture.<br /><br />If i remember correctly, the 1608 special release was bottled at 46% so i'm hoping this kind of thinking spreads into the standard line up</div>

				<div class="content">hey Adrian, yeah, i was working for Diageo during that marketing push and apparently its been tremendously successful for the bushmills sales in the states. Its always strange to hear so little from them in ireland when, over in california at least, we were always basically given blank cheques to pour as much as we liked of whatever we liked. I was never short of bottles of 16, 21, or 1608 to do with as i saw fit. Specifically, the Since Way Back line is meant to push the blend as a competitor to jemmie while there's a parallel attempt to differentiate the single malt line as a seperate entity at whisky fairs and the like and present it as a series. My end of the work was mostly in the later but i know Diageo have been pouring money into advertising over in the states like there was no tomorrow. that being said, before i left, my boss told me the diageo bushmills budget has been recently cut back a little from what it was during some massive Diageo reorganization this year. that being said, it still seems to be doing fine.</div>

				<div class="content">No plans for any new releases.<br /><br />I was speaking to Daryl a couple of weeks back and there are no plans for new bottlings and he said it would be highly unlikely. I havent visited since they added the 9th still and there is now a 10th still and have planning permission  for, i think 6/7 new warehouses.<br /><br />Interesting was the logic that they could build a distillery within the distillery, so i assume they may look to make their own grain down the line.</div>

I mentioned before that the gave me 6 bottles of regular just to have it on display curing the opera festival in October. I gave most away over Christmas for sponsorship etc. I inquired about other Diageo Spirits such as the classic malts or other Bushmills and i'm still waiting to see if i can buy direct of them.<br />It really seems they have no interest in the Irish market.</div>

				<div class="content">i read the review above and i quote<br />&quot;Bushmills is one of the only distilleries in the world that produces its whiskeys completely under one roof. The “grain to glass” facility malts, distills, matures, blends and bottles at Ireland’s oldest working distillery.&quot;<br /><br />I think there may be a few misleading facts here. Fionnán (working experience with Diageo + general whiskey knowledge) may set the record straight here. Does Bushmill's produce all its own whiskey?<br /><br />As for the oldest Distillery well, I still think it would be a great idea to have a 21 year old SPS for their 250 birthday. <br /><br />While I'm Bush bashing here, Isn't  it a bit tacky to have those gold medal on the label when the product didn't get any.</div>
