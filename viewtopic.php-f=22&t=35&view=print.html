				<h3>O'Briens in the Beacon, Sandyford, Dublin 18</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/iws/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Fri Mar 20, 2009 9:02 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">This is O'Briens flagship store and certainly worth a visit if your in the area. Has a very good selection of Irish and Scotch whiskies. They have a good range of premium whiskies for that 'corporate' purchase. They stock the Duncan Taylor The NC2 Range (non coloured, non chill filtered) of independent bottlings covering a variety of scottish distilleries. Also has the Ardbeg Double Barrell Gun Case, worth a trip just to view this ultra-luxury end edition of 2x 1974 Ardbeg single cask bottlings complete in leather gun case for  something like â‚¬13,000? <br /><br />Perfect destination for a wine tasting from the three automatic dispensing carousels where you can tasteover 30 wines before buying.<br /><br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.obrienswine.ie">www.obrienswine.ie</a><!-- w --></div>

				<h3>Redmond's, Ranelagh, Dublin 6</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/iws/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Fri Apr 03, 2009 10:30 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Redmond's, Ranelagh, Dublin 6</span></span><br /><br />Posh southside suburb, but with fairly funky residents due to popularity with students, perhaps.<br /><br />Anyhow, unlike many other posh southside suburbs, this one has a half-decent off-licence which takes whiskey seriously. Their prices bear comparison with the rest of the Republic of course (ie, they're for the most part eye-wateringly pricey compared with the rest of the planet) but there isn't the 'southside tax' I often find in other alcohol retailers south of the Liffey.<br /><br />Great selection, including a few rarities. Comprehensive range of Irish, and a decent roster of Scotches too. Even the odd dram from further afield.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to visit, but if you were in the neighbourhood, it's well worth dropping in for a look at what they've got. And you might even find that incredibly rare entity on Dublin's southside - an actual bargain.<br /><br /><br />Originally Posted by JC Skinner</div>

				<h3>JJ Fox, 119 Grafton St. Dublin.</h3>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">JJ Fox, 119 Grafton St. Dublin 2.</span></span><br /><br />Well worth a visit. If not for their recently expanded range of whiskeys; then for the cigars at least! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />They have a nice selection of Irish and Scotch whiskeys including a number of single cask Bushmills orginally bottled for la Maison du Whisky.<br /><br />It is located at the bottom of Grafton Street (opposite Trinity College), the Staff are friendly and I'm told that they regularly have tastings and related events.<br /><br />John.</div>
