				<div class="content">I think the main thing, in terms of atmosphere, is not to have loud music (unless you have a band) and don't have things like slot machines or the like. A good selection of Irish whiskey, of course. And stout.</div>

				<div class="content">What The Local in Minneapolis did was very clever: create a refreshing &quot;signature drink&quot; (just Jameson, ginger ale, lime, ice in their case) and get everyone to drink it. Really made a feature out of the Irish whiskey and the Irish pub theme.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi katekost, welcome. <br />Allot would depend on where your opening the pub. <br />If you are in Ohrid, then its more tourist Irish pub.       Copy and paste Paddywackery, with a food theme. I say this because it's all tourist and seasonal,very little local trade because it's pricey.              In bigger cities like Skopje or Bitola(excuse spelling,using phone,and cant search) you'll rely more on local trade i'd feel and a speciality drinks would always work. A cocktail section is a good idea, although not really Irish, you'll still need to pay rent. I've never been to Skopje  but i'm sure it's the same a Bitola with one single street getting all the attention. It's a beautiful country and will soon be discovered as a ideal holiday location. I would love to get back there.  <br />It would be hard to get Irish trad music but i'm sure local talent is good. It's all about the atmosphere. I wish you well and when you get off the ground i'll try visit. <br />Of course a good whiskey menu is a must.</div>
