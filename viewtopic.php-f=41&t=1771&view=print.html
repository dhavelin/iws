When they sent me more pics it became clear that it was in better shape than the shot on the web site made it look.  Good seal, and enough of the lable left to make it obvious.  I don't know when I shall open it -- some day though.  I was going to add a pic, but I need to shrink it.  Later...</div>

It seems a wine retailer with a half decent selection of whiskys took it upon himself to value it at £100,000 stg. It got massive media attention but was never going to sell for that money. Another in better condition popped up shortly after and was put into auction and did not even hit it's reserve which was a few thousand. About a year ago one went at auction for under £800 (I think) before fees. And of course the one in Whisky Exchange which was advertised for circa £900-1000. <br /><br />It is always the case though a bottle pops up creates interest then a few more suddenly appear and the price slums drastically.</div>

				<div class="content">Hard to even say was it worth 5,000 but prob. near the mark. The advertising for the auction and the<br />fact that internet bids can now come in live give  would nowadays really help to achieve that price otherwise<br />it was up to who was there on the day , the reserve set and a person's pocket. I think (but stand to be corrected) <br />the record at an Auction is still around £38,00 for a Scotch some years ago.</div>
