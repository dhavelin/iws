				<div class="content">Myself and the missus went to Kilbeggan Distillery recently and saw the casks laid down for Obama and a few others while there. It fermented the idea that we would love to put a family cask down specifically for our 9 month old son when he reaches 18 years of age. Obviously this is a dream and the probability is even if the Distillery does it we will probably not be able to afford it given the cost of bonding/storing the cask on top of purchasing it.<br /><br />Any of you learned gentlemen (and women) know if it is possible here in Ireland and what would be involved if it is?</div>

				<div class="content">You could ask them to fill a cask for you at Kilbeggan. It might cost around €1,000 to €1,500. I think 18 yrs might be a long time in a quarter cask, though.</div>

				<div class="content">As John said above and that Price should also include costs of storage for a few years so if they are available for sale they will let you know how long. Cooley Quarter casks are now standard measures and will be between 90 &amp; 120 liters, hence the guestimate of €1000 -1500, and are actually closer to half a cask in size but quarter cask is the term used for small casks. Storage will be included probably for 6 to 8 years (I forget exactly) then you pay for further storage costs by the year but that is not overly expensive. However you have to bare in mind Duty, Vat and Bottling costs at the end of all that. So it's all depending on how much in the cask at bottling it will still be a sizeable sum and probably at least €1500 again. <br /><br />Once you get your literage you can work it out.<br /><br />It is (amount of Litres - circa 2% evapouration per annum + Duty) + Bottling costs and Vat on top of all that.<br /><br />Not even sure if they sell full casks at all these days but a full bourbon cask is around 220L and the cost of a 10year old cask averages out at about 10,000 if buying it fully matured.</div>

				<div class="content">@JohnM I did ask whilst on the tour and the guide said they weren't doing casks for individuals but I will drop a line to Cooley directly to see. Yep on reflection 18 years in a Quarter Cask would be a bit long, may look at 8 years getting it bottled and then storing it until the nipper hits 18 <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />@IrishWhiskeyChaser Those costs are in line with what I would have estimated so that is not a major fear for us. So I guess an email to someone in Cooley is in order to see if this is possible or not. A full cask is out of the question totally from the cost point of view and the consumption point of view LOL.</div>

				<div class="content">You could ask the Celtic Whiskey Shop. They are the agents for Cooley whiskey in Ireland so that might be why Cooley are reluctant to deal with a customer directly.</div>
