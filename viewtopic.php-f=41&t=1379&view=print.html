				<div class="content">I have a small quandary....<br /><br />what do you all do with your empty bottles? I have a handful of empty bottles that I am somewhat torn over. While are goodness has been long drained I don't want to throw out the bottles, but they are just taking up space. If it was a bottle of run of the mill Jameson it would be straight in the recycle with it. However, while not in any way rare or exclusive, the would be...interesting?<br /><br />They are things like a 16 year old bowmore from 2007 (labelled 1991) and 2008 (labelled 1992), a bottle of bunnahabhain darach ur, a yamazaki 12 year old, a lagavullin distillers edition, a talisker distillers edition and a laphroaig 15 year old. <br /><br />so, my question is this, what do you all do, horde like a lunatic or mercilessly dump.<br /><br />I am leaning towards dumping so if anyone wants anything listed above for a dusty collection of memories of fine whiskey shout and you can have it.<br /><br />C.</div>

They refill expensive bottles of wine with something or another and then sell it as the real thing to their unsuspecting noveau riche patrons for full price. I can only imagine they would do the same with whiskey empties given the chance. Check out the price for high end empty bottles on eBay it's shocking.</div>

Might have just been one prolific seller under a number of different names.</div>

				<div class="content">I've only ever held on to one bottle and that was a Hibiki 17yo which I removed the label and now filled with a sample of Midleton. The rest I bin (Recycle bin), I'd be shot other wise ... over the years I have binned 100's of non standard bottles.<br /><br />Of the ones you mentioned the physical bottles themselves are still fairly bog standard bottles so I reckon it's the labels your more attached to.<br /><br />Maybe you could try something like this ... Something I toyed with but just did not have enough interest in it to do. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.label-a-peel.com/" class="postlink">Label A-Peel</a><br /><br />I think there are others on the market too so do a web search and you could do up a scrapbook type thing.<br /><br />Or simply steep them in warm water until they slide off and then dry them.</div>

				<div class="content">I peel of the labels of the bottle and dry them. Afterwards i laminate the label and stick it in a album. <br /><br />I do that for a good while now, and i think it is a nice memory.</div>
