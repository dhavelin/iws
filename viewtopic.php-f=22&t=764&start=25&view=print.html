				<div class="content">3 years on.....<br />Have anybody who were going to ask somebody about yeast/cask influence on taste, got any wiser? This is a fascinating topic and I hope for some interest.<br />Yeastwise my feeling is that the type of yeast used, and the length of the fermentation is important in the development of esters and aldehydes in the newmake. Also the making of the cut will have an impact, but with triple distillation I don't know how much.<br />I think Mammon is the ruler in the industry, efficiency and speed are more important than flavour and quality.</div>

				<div class="content">Great second revival for the topic. <br /><br />In the years since this started I've tried many different older Whiskeys. That musty taste is more prominent in the Dublin Whiskeys from my experience. Older Paddys didn't have it to the same extent as Jamesons. <br /><br />I've noticed it in varying degrees with Redbreasts from 60-70's. <br /><br />It led me to another idea on it. I think there's a combination of things happen. The watering down from cask strength to bottle strength would introduce certain minerals etc. I'm assuming nowadays this is much more efficient. <br />That musty note could be caused by the interaction of the water and changes in composition and decomposition over time. <br /><br />It varies from bottle to bottle and over time from the bottles I've tasted. Could certain aldahides/minerals/lactones/esters/congeners in the whiskey be also affected by storage condition and light interaction with these? <br /><br />I've more of a &quot;database&quot; now and will definitely contact Distillers to get to the bottom of this. More research is needed.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'm after finding about 70-80mls of old Green Spot. It's has been lying in a dry lit cabinet for about 18 months. <br /><br />The strange thing about it is the musty notes reference into this tread are more evident with the oxidation, although it's still faint. The liquorice notes are more pronounced too. There has to be a connection.</div>
