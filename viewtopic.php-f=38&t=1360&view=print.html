But i do recall the vodka tasting like alcohol with no  descriptive flavor/USA spelling  lol.  Yet the poitin Had a recognisable flavour. I would say it was a  bit more enjoyable than plain vodka.<br /><br />I regret that i did not pay atention to the gaelic spelling when i made the label.<br /> I think that David had given it to me ahile back. I would have put it on the label but there was too much information for me to absorb..<br /><br /><br />We were also thinking of saying that it was aged NEAR heavily charred  burbon barrels. But i didnt want the item to be a laughing stock as  i took the project quite seriously.<br /><br />Well the Irish style whiskey is next after i do a few modifications to my cooker and boiler. The 100% malted barley is waiting.<br /><br />I think you remember that this poitin thing started out as  my attempt to do irish whiskey. With the input from  this website, i realised what i was actually doing and changed the goal of the project. <br /><br />I will get it right next time</div>
