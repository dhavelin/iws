				<div class="content">Greetings,<br /><br />I found a store selling the Jameson 12 year with the 1780 designation.  I understand that the packaging for Jameson no longer has this designation.  Would this bottle be worth buying as a collector's item?  Or is it the same Jameson 12 as is sold everywhere?  I believe it was selling for 33 US dollars, plus tax.  Thank you for your advice.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5307/5630197174_c59f973775.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">I think it is worth buying, especially at that price. These have variable prices at auction but they should gain as time goes on. I have seen them go for over â‚¬60 but also in the 30s.c[code][/code]</div>

				<div class="content">Definitely worth picking up and tasting side by side with the present 12 year old Jameson Special Reserve, it may have a bit more of a sherry characteristic than the present 12yo. As regards value you may make a little, but as a former regular bottling won't likely appreciate too much if at all.<br /><br />Let us know how you get on...</div>
