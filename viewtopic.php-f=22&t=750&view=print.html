				<div class="content">Anyone have any thoughts on this. As posted in another thread I've got rather a lot of open ones - some of these will never be touched again - any suggestions? I could give them away, I could swap them, I could blend them (up to a point), or maybe hold a big tasting of everything I don't want and only invite people I don't like. <br /><br />Maybe the society should invest in a big cask we could all pour our unwanted whiskey into.</div>

				<div class="content">See there's another thing. I seem to have acquired standard bottles of Teachers, Bells and Famous Grouse - I know they'll never be opened - maybe I should give them away as presents or something. Though Zoltan's idea isn't bad. I could also water them down and sell them to teenagers! ONLY JOKING. I APOLOGISE RIGHT AWAY. TEENAGE DRINKING IS NOT FUNNY.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>DavidH wrote:</cite>I think we need a Cooking with Whiskey thread.</div></blockquote><br /><br />That is something alright, but you tend to only use small quantities, and it's going to be hard to beet IWC's recipe.<br /><br />That said, I can think of a few times I've used an unwanted whiskey in food. If you're making pate you can throw in a good healthy dollop. Likewise if you're having a 70's cooking night you can make marie rose sauce a lot more interesting with a good dash of malt whisk(e)y of some sort. And there's the good ole bbq sauce recipes which usually involve whiskey of some sort.<br /><br />Things not to try (from experience):<br /><br />Soak smoked salmon in a peated whisky. Not good.<br /><br />Soak cured ham in malt whisky. Not good at all at all - you end up with rubbery no taste ham. And don't try and retrieve the situation by then drinking the whisky you used for the soaking!</div>

				<div class="content">What about a whiskey swap shop?<br /><br />I now have the premises to host something like this, all that needs to be done is to come up with a system to value the bottles and their quantities.<br /><br />You could simply drop of some bottles and if another member comes in a few days later with their bottles and sees something they like they then swap to the correct value, im will to come up with a system that suits everyone.</div>

				<div class="content">Sounds reasonable to me. But then again I've only given the idea about 15secs thought. Would you be allowed to serve whiskeys you hadn't opened yourself? I mean from a health and safety etc. perspective.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />    Ummmm, please explain &quot;opened bottles your NOT going to drink&quot;.  This does not compute.  I'm sooooo confused!<br />I can tell you this much, if I buy a bottle of (whatever) and spend good money, you can be sure that I will drink every damn last drop (love it or not) !  IainB, could you please explain why you would not open a bottle of Teacher HLC or The Famous Grouse ?  I own both (well, The Famous Grouse Gold Reserve) and TEACHERS HLC.  Considering it's budget pricing, I think they are good bargain drams.  A Teaspoon of Spring water in the TEACHERS helps it nicely.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">i have an Arran sherry cask, i had a few dram, but for god sake, if you beat me with a stick, i still not drink that again, it was about 60-70 euros, <br />but i also know there is lads who is mad for it, so i be happy to swap that or even give it away for free, because it is not for my taste<br />and as i always say: your sh.t could be someone else's happiness</div>

I don't plan on throwing them away but in reality they'r ejust going to sit there.<br /><br />Likewise the unopened ones. I've no probelm with Teachers etc. but they're so far down the list of whiskies I want to open that I just don't see it happening. And I didn't even spend money - they were all given to me a various stages. If you're ever in Wicklow you can have them!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi IainB,<br /><br />  Wow!  I see YOUR point.  70 bottles is a LOT of bottles.  I'm just too poor to have so many bottles opened at one time.  I have perhaps six to eight opened bottles.  Heck, if I was in Wicklow, I'd take you up on your kind offer.  Thanks IainB.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>
