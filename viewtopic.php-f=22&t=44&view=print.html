				<div class="content">Spotted a couple of articles in breakingnews.ie &amp; finfacts<br /><br /><br />Up to 9,000 jobs will be lost from pubs and off-licences this year because of plummeting alcohol sales, the drinks industry claimed today.<br /><br />Trade representatives said last year was their worst in a quarter of a century because of the economic slump and increased cross-border shopping.<br /><br />read the full report <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><a href="http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/eyaumhidmhau/" class="postlink">here</a></span><br /><br />another report states 2008 has been the worst performing year for the drinks industry in Ireland<br /><br />read full report <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><a href="http://www.finfacts.com/irishfinancenews/article_1016262.shtml" class="postlink">here</a> </span><br /><br /><br />What annoys me is that everybody cries for the Government to do something ..... what about lobbying the drinks industry to drop their prices all through retail, wholesale and the Manufacturing Industry. For instance it is obvious that  the price of the Pint is hugely inflated in comparison to off-licence prices. However Whiskey is priced very high in Ireland even before VAT &amp; Duty are added .... just a quick look at regular whiskey up the north or prices in the US and some European countries for the likes of Irishman Cask Strength, Jameson Gold, 18yo and Rarest can attest to that and this appears to be set by the Manufactures pricing.</div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately the country is drinking itself into oblivion despite the high price of alcohol. I think that's one reason for the high price of alcohol. A shame for responsible drinkers. <br /><br />And while it might be true that 9,000 jobs will go, I wouldn't believe the figures published by the industry. It's in their interest to say they need a helping hand. Like yer man Dunne who wants to build those towers in Ballsbridge... he says he'll create 5,000 jobs, but nobody knows where he got those figures. And if it was the case, he'd be taking those jobs from different areas of the city. <br /><br />I don't really know what I'm talking about.</div>

				<div class="content">It's the same everywhere. Diageo are shedding jobs.<br /><br />I really hope the prices come down, though. Or at least stop going up the way they are.</div>
