Because the 2nd release - code L10218/48 is not quite the same. The 2nd lacks the richness and complexity and has that hint of 'baby sick' ( this isn't bad in itself ) which is absent from the 1st. Don't get me wrong, the 2nd is still a fine whisky - just not the award winner that the 1st is. I posted this before but to show the differences the 1st release is the one on the right.<br /> <br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5166/5271932561_5c8a844477.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

I just love Cooley malt and it's just that that i want in my glass. Interesting to note that the light and fruity Cooley doesn't take to added colour, as i always suspected it wouldn't.<br /> <br /><br />Redbreast 15. A great nose, i could nose this all day long. Thanks again John. There is an exotic fruit on the palate, passionfruit, or is it guava?<br /> <br /><br />Old Comber 7 pps. Wow, different. A confusing nose consisting of unripe fruits such as apple and banana bound together with a sweet vanilla. A 'weak bourbon' nose. Turpentine and menthol on the palate, soft though, mixed with other soft volatiles. A full bottle would be required to suss this one out properly. An experience.</div>

				<div class="content">Bowmore 25yo ... a typical Bowmore but much more umph than I would have expected from a malt this age which is good, kind of reminds me of how great a HP 25yo is, and of course this Bowmore is more complex than a younger Bow with much bigger flavour profile, great dept and a long finish.  <br /><br />Class ... <br /><br />... these should be walking out of CWS at the price Ally has them at (Bargain  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  ).</div>

				<div class="content">Really like the McCarthy's. We had it at our American tasting last summer, an interesting change of pace from the bourbons. As I recall, it's VERY smokey, quite young, and made with Scottish malt, but its quality certainly belies its age.<br />I'm at the other end of the spectrum myself tonight. Glenfarclas 21 yo - a true sherry monster. Sweet, delicious and mouth coating.</div>

				<div class="content">Revisited Bowmore 25yo which @ 43% actually feels like possibly 46%.<br /><br />Plenty of sweetness here but not straight sweetness because as well as toffee their is also burnt sugar and chocolate liqueur flaovours. This probably only needs another 10-15 years to make it perfect, hence the 9/10 mark  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Now on to a Tyrconnell 17years and 6 months old  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> This is at cask strength and really stands up to the Bowmore 25 ... I know one is cask strength the other isn't but even so who says Irish can't stand up to Scotch ... I know I'm repeating myself here but I feel I have to to dispell the myths generated by both sides of the Irish/Scotch debate. Anyway way this is typical Tyrconnell but just bigger  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Plenty of the usual fruit but the extra abv seems to only bulk the whiskey up in viscosity rather than over the top alcohol power. Possibly a bigger spice bust too. This is a beautifully balanced malt and virtually a palate clenser. Quite yummy. Another 9/10 bacically for the fact that this is not an any time dram as I need to be in the mood to have such a fruity sweet dram. However one thisng is sure Cooley malt is aging very well  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
