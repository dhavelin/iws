				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />    I am a HUGH fan of the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship).  Here in the States, there is a weekly TV show titled The Ultimate Fighter.  Do they air either the UFC fights or The Ultimate Fighter TV series in Ireland ?  <br />I know there recently was a LIVE UFC event from Ireland.  I believe it was a successful event.<br />There is a BIG fight coming up on the 29th. of May.  Rampage Jackson vs. Rashad Evans.   I will not watch the <br />&quot;pay per view&quot; event as it is just too expensive.  I'll just have to wait until it air's free.

				<div class="content">Hi John,<br /><br />   Thanks for responding to my post.  I guess the UFC isn't too popular in Ireland lol.  I do like Boxing but, I haven't seen too many fights since it went to &quot;pay per view&quot; many years ago.  I grew up watching some AWESOME <br />(free) fights on TV in the 70's, 80's especially.  Thanks for the link you provided.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Tom aka SixCats!</div>

ESPN shows all the major UFC events live.  so yes, ill be watching rampage v evans this weekend.  and as for TUF, it has changed in the last few years.  when i first moved over here, it was on Bravo a few days behind american.  these days it is shown on setanta sports.  i do not pay for that channel anymore, but i can access them online via yidio's website.  this season so far is pretty bad, haha.  <br /><br />MMA in ireland is starting to really grow.  and its already very big in the UK.  hell, rampage now trains with the wolf's lair in liverpool with bisping.  i went to the black box theater in galway last year to watch some MMA.  it was ireland vs. the UK.  good times, cheap beer and 10 feet away from the cage.  gives you a whole new perspective on the fighting.</div>

MMA  can seem boring at first, but you need to learn all the moves and you can appreciate it a lot more.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey brettie, <br />You raised an important point there in your post and I think it goes to the heart of the issue. I am a big boxing fan and I boxed from an early age as did my Dad (though he was FAR more successful <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) When I watch it I get a lot more than I get from the MMA or UFC principally because I believe boxing is more regulated. I have a hard time trying to work out exactly what the rules are in the other two codes! Fair enough, certain moves are outlawed, but beyond that it is impossible to figure out what warrants a warning, dismissal, etc. So it looks more like a free-for- all. Even with the MMA, you get SO many different codes entering that it must be impossible to 'advance' the sport because everyone is performing from different backgrounds, unlike boxing.</div>

				<div class="content">also, the UFC is very regulated.  it just takes time to fully understand whats going on.  a fighter has never died in UFC and most fights are stopped quickly by the ref as to ensure no more unnecessary damage.  boxing can be a lot more dangerous because guys can be knocked out on their feet and still get beat in the head for 10 rounds.</div>

UFC over the weekend...saw a guy get kneed in the solar plexis.  went down like a sack of bricks....awesome to see such a powerful strike.  almost as good as bas rutten's liver shots, haha<br /><br />its weird since i have been watching MMA so long.  the last time i watched a boxing match, that seemed more barbaric to me.  just nonstop punches to the head at full force...seemed so over the top to me.  in MMA, most guys can't take that much damage before getting knocked out.  nor will most of them stand and take it because of the lighter weight gloves.</div>
