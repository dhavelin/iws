				<div class="content">The Yoichi 10 did indeed get drunk a couple of weeks ago.  A nice flavour profile, but a bit too 'spirity' for my preference.  That may be a product of the mini-bottle format, which I have found to have more inconsistent results than their big bottle counterparts.  THe Parker's Heritage bourbon should finally see its conclusion today, in honour of a friend's birthday.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, Makers is one of my go to US whiskers. If you ever see a Black seal version on whiskyauction go for it. They don't make it any more but it used to be a very limited release and is top notch.<br /><br />Just killed the last of my Flora and Fauna 16yo Mortlach. Great example of a sherried Whisky from this distillery.</div>

				<div class="content">Haven't been in a while (almost 4 months!!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> ), but in that time I have finished off a Parker's Heritage Collection 4th ed. (10 yo wheated) bourbon, a freebie bottle of Bowmore 12, and alas, a Glenfarclas 15.  The 'farclas is one of my absolute favourites.  I noticed that my cabinet is almost entirely bereft of sherry casked whiskies (an unopened Laga 16, a Sonnalta PX that is down to its last quarter...and that just might be it (Talisker 18?)!).  <br /><br />On the chopping block over the next couple of months are the aforementioned Sonnalta PX (very reluctantly...I may just decant into a smaller bottle and string it out longer), a Bowmore Tempest Batch 2, a Clynelish 18 yo from Signatory, and a Booker's Bourbon.<br /><br />Whisk(e)y budget rather limited this year, but my focus will be at least a couple from Auchentoshan Three Wood, Aberlour A'bunadh, Glenfiddich 15 DE, or a re-stock of the Glenfarclas 15.  A couple of cheaper bottles could include a Bushmills Black Bush and/or Te Bheag.</div>

				<div class="content">Instead of the ones that I mentioned in my previous post in this thread, I ended up finishing a bottle of Rittenhouse Rye, 100 proof, Bottled in Bond, on Saturday night.  A very nice bottle of rye that had a lot going on, including a peanut brittle note that I have picked up in a couple of ryes in recent months.  The previously noted Clynelish 18 will be the next to go, likely this week.  The Sonnalta PX did indeed get emptied into a 180ml mini bottle that previously held Yoichi 10 yo.</div>

				<div class="content">Indeed, my first &quot;fully documented&quot; (thank you Signatory labeling) indie bottle purchase saw its end last night after about 18 months.  The Signatory UCF Collection Clynelish 18 (18/12/92-18/5/11, bourbon hogsheads #17272/73, bottle 265 of 771) was not an active cask, but was a very enjoyable, lighter profile, offering.  Some nice honey and wax, along with grassy and some peppery notes.<br /><br />I have noticed that the final pours of most of my bottles (since they last 18+ months, typically) benefit from a small amount of water being added.  Either in removing off notes, or in opening up a profile that had started to shut down.</div>

				<div class="content">.... a single Cask of Bushmills Distillers Reserve.<br /><br />Bottled for LMDW. Distilled in 1985 and I'm guessing it was a 12-15 year old.<br /><br />Full strength at 56.5%.<br /><br />Probably a sherru=y cask and really tasty. At cask strength this is a full but drinkable whiskey. Macallan eat you heart out no prisoners held here.<br /><br />Powererfuol yet approachable and very enjoyable. <br /><br />I wish the there were more Irish single cash sherry monsters. I suppose I'll have to make do with Tullamore Phoeniex to partially fill the gap.<br /><br />Again wonderfully rich whiskey with a decent sherry quality.</div>
