				<div class="content">It came from the Old Cork Distillery. I seen some labels in the Midleton distillery. There was a couple of bottles on whiskyauction.com recently. <br /><br />It's certainly rare but the doesn't mean it's good. It's interesting stuff all the same. I'd guess its a pot still/grain blend. <br /><br />Will it appear on your menu? Is there others out there that your looking for?</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>patricksparis wrote:</cite>i doubt ill open that one, if its not supposed to be that good, theres no point. im still looking for any whiskey i havent sourced yet</div></blockquote><br /><br />It's always worth opening. I don't know if it good or bad. Price isn't a reflection of that. I remember a Hennessy na-Geanna whiskey selling for â‚¬500+. That was a plain malt but rare and therefore expensive. <br /><br />The VAT house in Dublin had some rare whiskeys on them. The whiskey wasn't necessarily great but few have the chance of tasting really old whiskeys and would pay for them. <br /><br />Hewitts is another example. It was a cheap blend years ago but now it gone expensive. It's another one worth tracking down. I liked the stuff. I wish they'd kept it instead of Dunphys.</div>
