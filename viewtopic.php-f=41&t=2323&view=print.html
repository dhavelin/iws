				<div class="content">Cork Distilleries bottle --- I know things were recycled but a 'jubilee' whiskey I would<br />expect even back then to be bottled by a distiller themselves -- would they have<br />released it to a bonder ??????? Both seals are similar but the forum one posted looks <br />very new !! Personally I wouldn't buy it and have passed on similar items in the past.</div>

				<div class="content">I see on the Whisky Exchange site they state fromt he 50's.<br /><br />I've seen a few of these pop up the odd time before, one of which was imaculate and wrapped in cleophane. From what I remember it had a similar cap but I could not be sure. But these bottlings if I remember from research and conversations with various people could even be from the 60's or 70's so maybe not as old as they look. <br />Would love to try an authentic one as it would be interesting to taste a 20yo Jameson from then. <br />However it is not a Distillery bottle as the Label states Woodford, Bourne &amp; Co ltd which indicates an independent bottling<br /><br />Woodford, Bourne &amp; Co. were grocers and wine merchants from Cork city so maybe the grapes on the seal are not the great streatch you may think.<br />They became known as Woodford, Bourne &amp; Co. In 1869 so could 1969 be the Jubliee in question. Total suposition on my behalf but something to ponder.<br /><br />In the 1980s, the shop was converted to a fast food outlet named 'Mandy's' and the premises was taken over by MacDonald's in the mid-1980s. So this would indicate they were in operation till the 70's.<br /><br />Also another interesting fact on this is that the Old Casks of Kilbeggan returned to the Distillery (for a price and un drinkable  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> ) were also recovered from a renovation of a building in cork for a McDonnalds. Could this be one and the same premises???<br /><br />No idea but  not a fantastical assumption.</div>

				<div class="content">There is a good quality book available on this company published c.15 yrs. ago<br />which would have def. info. Wine warehouse auction was held in early '90's as <br />they also had another location as I recall.They bottled an hotel house wine in<br />the '70's/'80's called 'Mirabeau'. 'Jubilee' as a word is not commonly used. It <br />is from another time. The big 'Jubilee' was Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in <br />1887 so this name could have been in use as a brand for a 20 yr. old whiskey by <br />Woodford Bourne since then --- again just a guess. The label as far as I am concerned <br />is of a different vintage to the plastic covering. That label is very old in style in my<br />opinion --- any printer on the forum that knows styles / typesetting etc.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />That is indeed the same bottle I posted on this site 5 years ago. It was bottle of whiskey I received from my aunt as a raffle prize and as I felt it was a little unusual I posted it here to find out a little more about it and to see its value. At the time I was told it was worth anywhere between £250 - £500. It was indeed a genuine bottle of whiskey that she had received as a gift in the 1970's. I decided to eventually sell it at Adams today with a guide of €200 - €400 and it made €320 on the day.<br /><br />Neady</div>
