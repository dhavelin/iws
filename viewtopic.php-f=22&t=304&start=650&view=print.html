				<div class="content">Yes sulphur can be a bit of a pain.<br /><br />Some of the worst sulphured Whiskies I've had have been IB Glenrothes however conversely some of my favourites have been OB Glenrothes ... there is often a light sulphuring in these but along with some liquorice flavours I actually think it adds to to the flavour profile. Sulphur can really ruin a good whiskey but a little is not an issue for me.</div>

				<div class="content">Simply because blends are their thing. Little effort goes into the malt market. They are fortunate to have some decent distilleries, and now and again they do a decent bottling. I read that even some of their expensive Manager's Choice bottlings could be from better casks, why the problem with finding the better casks? I don't think they have enough people on the job. But i should state that i'm fussy, i think Talisker 10 and Lagavulin 16 ( Diageo's big guns ) are not good enough and are going down hill, an opinion shared by many forumites on other forums.<br /> <br />But anyway, it will be interesting to see how Diageo Bushmills will fare against the spirit they inherited with the distillery, particularly regarding the wood policy.</div>

They are all excellent so far, for 3 yo they are up with the very best. Lacking wood complexity currently, as you would expect, but by age 10 this will be coming along nicely. It will be interesting as they cannot dump unwanted spirit into a blend, all of it will be single malt.<br /> <br /><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4105/5080387564_94c735ef28_z.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
