				<div class="content">I have tasted this new whiskey. I am happy to say that Concannon Whiskey is very nice!  The Petite Sirah has given the whiskey a light berry finish that is amazing.<br /><br />I know for some people a wine finished whiskey is not their cup of tea.  This is one that works very well.  It will be in the US first but keep an eye out for this one.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for that, sounds very interesting. Usually few finishes do it for me but I do like to try them.<br /><br />What I find is that sometimes is a finish does not seem to marry as well as a fully matured cask. In saying that the Tyrconnell Maderia is one of the best finishes going of any whiskey or whisky.<br /><br />Further the likes of the Tyrconnell Sherry finish that was bottled for the Whisky live was an excellent example of a sherry finished whiskey. The extra year seemed to have really improved on the regular 10yo which for me is a bit disjointed. However that is just my taste and the 10 is liked by many. <br /><br />Wine casks used to raise an eyebrow and be a bit contentious but that sort of thinking is a few years old now and some of these have proved good so why not ... Ally's Anima Negra Tyrconnell is another example of a lovely whiskey.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying this if I can get my hands on a bottle.</div>

I hope the society can magic up a bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm lucky enough to own 2 bottles   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ... (Big thanks to Dutch &amp; Rich  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> ).<br /><br />Had some last night, the underlying blend reminds me of a typical Kilbeggan style blend (Sweet grain with a plasticine note that I always seem to get but others don't  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  )  but there seems to be a decent presence of the Tyrconnell trait there too (malt &amp; pear) which helps to lift it beyond a bog standard Kilbeggan. This initially would not overly endear me to buy this as I can't say I'm a huge fan of the Kilbeggan style. <br /><br />However the wine finish (Petit Shiraz) pleasantly surprises and lifts this way above a bog standard Kilbeggan blend. Soft gentle fruits add a gentle fruity sweetness to the nose and nearly a ros√© like trait to the taste that make this much more enjoyable than the base blend. The whiskey is an easy drinker on the sweet side but well worth the price point and I'd nearly go as far to say a bargain.</div>
