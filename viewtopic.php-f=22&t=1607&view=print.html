				<div class="content">My understanding is that this bottle has been, or soon will be, subjected to a rather significant price increase in Europe.  Is this the case?  If so, how much of an increase has been applied?  I've seen the bottle change from Can$46 to $49 over the past 5-6 months here in Ontario and was wondering if this is just the start of a trend...<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any feedback!   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">This used to be the same price as Jameson 12yo for a long time. Then it went a couple euro dearer. So up until a fwe years back we had Jameson 12yo for €34.99 &amp; Redbreast €37.99. Then it was hiked up to €44 but that was over 2 years ago if I am correct. I have not heard of anything since. The RB 12yo cask strength is much higher at €72.99 which is quite expensive.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Fionnán wrote:</cite>for what its worth, in the states its been pretty consistently around 45-50 US dollars</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, I have found the LCBO prices on most Irish whiskies to be on par with the same offerings available in the US (depending of course on the store and state).  This is pleasantly unusual as a 'good' LCBO price on a bottle also offered in the US is usually a 35-50% markup from the US price, assuming that current US/Canadian $ exchange is essentially on par.  Irish whiskies, Morrison Bowmore, and Glenfarclas seem to be exceptions to this rule.</div>

				<div class="content">Sometime in the past month or so (I believe) the LCBO (the government operated liquor monopoly in Ontario) kicked up the price on this bottle from the $49 first mentioned in this thread to now $55.  Basically a 20% mark-up in about nine months (it was $46 last Christmas).  Hopefully, this is the end of the increases for the foreseeable future.  To be fair to IDL, the pricing changes are often at the whim of the LCBO as they set the shelf price, and the wholesaler/distributor picks up the extra profit...it's a bass ackward situation here.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> <br /><br />The Jameson 12 comes in at $50, so the difference in price is now similar to what IWC mentioned earlier in this thread.  I don't know how (if at all) the J12 has changed over the same time period.</div>
