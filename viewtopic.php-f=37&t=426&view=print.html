				<div class="content">I'm more curious about their whiskeys than their bourbons, although I won't complain if I  get to try some new bourbons that aren't sold here.<br />But really the microdistilling thing has taken off in the States more than anywhere, and I'd be very in favour of promoting the artisan.<br />There are small distilleries making whiskey from Oregon to New York and in many other states too. Not easy to source here, of course. But we've got time to track them down.</div>

				<div class="content">Any aged rye would be a treat, but OP does seem to get a tremendously good press.<br />Despite myself, I'd be intrigued to try their recreations of early American whiskeys too. I know it's only marketing guff, but they're still intriguing experiments, and there is a little validity to the claims they make.<br />I hear good things about Stranahan's in Colorado too. Located next to a microbrewery I think. They've won some awards recently.<br />Along similar lines, Tuthilltown in New York do a range of whiskeys, including a couple of ryes and four grain bourbon. One of the ryes is allegedly a recreation of the whiskey used in the original Manhattan cocktail. More guff, of course, but they're an artisan operation and the products, though young, are very interesting.<br />I have a bottle of <span style="font-weight: bold">McCarthy's Oregon Single Malt</span>, which I picked up at its only European retail outlet, McCarthy's in Amsterdam last Autumn, which the society can have if they want for this tasting. I tasted it in Holland and it's like a very young, feisty, fiery Islay. Tons of smoke, which normally I'm not that impressed by. But it was good stuff.<br />I've had a couple of corn whiskeys in the past, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend the experience except as a learning one. <br />And I never appreciated the cloying vanillan quality that comes from the Lincoln County Process in Tennessee whiskey, but that's just me.<br />Bourbons easily warrant a night all to themselves, perhaps. But it all comes down to what we can source and what people would like to try.</div>

				<div class="content">in terms of bourbon, i've always been a fan of bulleit bourbon and woodford reserve if the society is interested in either. Tuthiltown whiskeys are sold here readily enough but they're pretty outrageously priced for the quality</div>

				<div class="content">That's the bind with young distilleries or indeed old, small distilleries sometimes.<br />They have to get product to market early to bring in revenue. Certainly, I've seen even new spirit being sold by start up distilleries in Europe for eyebrow-raising sums of cash.<br />But do tell us more. Have you ever tried any of the Tuthilltowns? What were they like in your experience?</div>

				<div class="content">I really like their manhattan rye whiskey. like you said yourself, corn whisky's a curious experience but its pretty greasy stuff. they also have a whisky marked as a single malt but i have no idea how they make it as they dont use pot stills in the first place, they use these strange ex-calvados type stills that still work in batches.</div>

				<div class="content">Calvados stills? That's a bit exotic alright. I never knew that.<br />I had a bottle of Mellow Corn once that tasted like a mouthful of whiskey-flavoured oil. Platte Valley was better, I thought.<br />In terms of different grains, rye would the the big American one for me. But I'd be really curious to try Berheim's wheat whiskey too.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi folks,<br /><br />I'm the organiser.  Sorry I've been tardy about posting on the tasting.<br /><br />A lot of people in Ireland aren't familiar with US whiskey, so I was going to include a couple of mainstream whiskies (both these are spelt &quot;whisky&quot;, funnily enough), which I can provide:<br /><br />Maker's Mark Red Seal<br />George Dickel No 12 (brown label rather than black)<br /><br />The suggestions below were all great.  I was going to go for a rye and was thinking of Rip Van Winkle, but if IainB has the Rittenhouse that would be good too.<br /><br />I've never tried the Old Portero and would love to have a go if someone has a bottle.  I'd also love to try the McCarthy which jcskinner and IainB have both kindly offered.<br /><br />That means we need one or two more out of Blanton's, Eagle Rare and Elijah Craig from whiskeybro and IainB.<br /><br />As a wrap up at the end, I was thinking of some US whiskey cocktails - I've made Whiskey Sours but would like to try Mint Juleps or Manhattans or a Bronx.  Would that offend any purists?  I could use the Dickel or Maker's Mark for that , which which allow me to drop one of those for another more specialist bottle.  Would we have to clear any cocktail making with the hotel?<br /><br />Any views on the above?  It would be useful to meet those of you who have offered bottles, say in the week or so before the tasting, so I/we could do some notes before hand.<br /><br />So, in summary my proposal is ...<br /><br />1 Dickel<br />2 Maker's Mark (either 1 or 2  might be used for cocktails)<br />3 Rittenhouse<br />4 McCarthy<br />5 Old Portero (if available)<br />6 One or two from Blanton's/Eagle Rare/Elijah Craig <br />and cocktails to finish<br /><br />Looking forward to comments!<br /><br />Regards,<br />L</div>

				<div class="content">Regarding cocktails, I am certainly curious to know what a Whiskey Sour or Manhattan, say, tastes like. I'd suggest keeping the logistics as simple as possible with pre-measured quantities, for example, and perhaps not bothering with anything that needs to be muddled.

It still wouldn't come with a commentary on popularity, variations, history etc, though.<br /><br />If the presenter wants to illustrate a point about how whiskey is typically enjoyed in the US then I think it's quite educational and a fun twist on the usual format.<br /><br />I don't mind either way.

				<div class="content">Im around on the 24th so could assist with the cocktails essentially you could make up a whisky sour and hand it out in under 5 mins, the Julep takes a little longer, but instead of the muddling, infusing the mint into the whisky the day before, the only problem is the crushed ice required.<br /><br />Id suggest making a whisky sour at home its is easy, just take a lemon and cut it into wedges.<br />Shake about 3 or 4 wedges with 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 measure of whisky with cubes of ice and serve over ice in tumbler, now you can go down the egg white road to add foam to the drink, but health and safety issues these days!</div>
