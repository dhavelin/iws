				<div class="content">Dublin Airport's new Terminal 2 is going to have a high end Irish whiskey store.<br /><br />If you were asked to recommend ONE Irish Whiskey they should stock, what would it be?<br /><br />I know there are other more complex and elaborate whiskeys around, but for me, it would be The Irishman 70, as I love the potstill character, balanced with a single malt finish - quintessential Irish whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">Who is behind the shop? Do you know the size of it, or any other details?<br /><br />An unmissable wall of Irish whiskey out at the airport would do great things for the profile of the spirit. People often comment on the Celtic Whiskey Shop window display in Dawson Street. The airport would have much higher footfall than that street.<br /><br />Of course the shop needs to have all the Irish whiskeys, with someone on hand to make recommendations. It could create buzz around these parts with its own exclusive single casks.</div>

				<div class="content">I like the guys think a large selection is better than say any one whiskey being prominent.<br /><br />Irishman 70 is a worthy whiskey all right but so are many others ...<br /><br />Redbreast 15yo another cracking whiskey<br /><br />And Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve eventhough expensive is a wonderful whiskey.<br /><br />Writers Tears is another <br /><br />... but I think Davids idea of a wall of whiskey is interesting.<br /><br />I often fine that in travel retail shops, that sell whiskey, that they dont have a great concentration and never really have good displays.<br /><br />What it needs to do is have the biggest selection of Irish Whiskey they can and basically built a name of a place to go for Irish Whiskey and for that they could look for exclusive bottlings from the vatious Irish Distilleries .... a serious collection of Scotch will not do it any harm either.</div>
