				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />I noticed these two listings here at the LCBO.  Can anybody shed some light on these bottles for me?  Thanks in advance!!<br /><br />McFadden Spirit Drink (odd name...and strangely, but to their credit as I don't think they are required to mention it, it seems that &quot;caramel colorant&quot; is shown directly on the label)<br /><a href="http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?ITEM_NAME=west+cork&amp;ITEM_NUMBER=&amp;language=EN" class="postlink">http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?ITEM_NAME=west+cork&amp;ITEM_NUMBER=&amp;language=EN</a><br /><br />Also from the same distillery (seemingly) is West Cork Original Irish Whiskey.  It is not officially listed yet, but being advertised, so I can't include a link.  The photo I see shows a 700 mL bottle at 40% abv.  It trumpets a 'dual wood process', seemingly referring to bourbon and Irish oak.  It is marked as 'coming soon' with no listing price showing.  The McFadden is selling for $50, same as Jameson Select Reserve...as further reference, Black Bush is $38 and Redbreast 12 is $62.</div>

Worth a try anyway. I've had a small taste of Lough Hyne and Kennedy and liked them well enough to want to give it a proper sampling.</div>

Thanks for noting the other discussion thread...I was originally only looking at the West Cork Original, but then the McFadden popped up as well on the LCBO website.  I will likely be steering clear of both for the foreseeable future.  I'd rather go with Bushmills BB and Redbreast 12 any day of the week.</div>

At $50 a bottle it's not a patch on the Black Bush. <br /><br />The Rebdreast at $62 seems good value. It's over â‚¬60 in most places here.</div>

				<div class="content">The BB and RB12 will be repeat buys, along with Writer's Tears @ $52, at some point.  Ideally, I would love to get to Binny's to get Bushmills 21 (US $120) and Powers John's Lane 12 (US $65), though I have no idea when that will actually occur.</div>
