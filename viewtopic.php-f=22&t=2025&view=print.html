				<div class="content">Sorry my last post was a bit short - this didn't really come onto my radar. What is the vent supposed to be - is it the Midleton VR 2013, the new plant, or a new line up the the event is ostensibly about?<br /><br /> I see there's a retirement party for Barry Crockett the day before - is this connected.<br /><br />Anyway I guess whatever's about we'll probably get some clarity of some of the releases we've been expecting....<br /><br />Paddy 7yo SPS?<br />Powers JL signature?<br />Redbreast 21? <br /><br />Did I miss anything?</div>

For example the announcement on the Paddy 7yo SPS, complete surprise and unexpected.<br /><br />The events page is normally for society events only, even the liquid irish blog has no information as presumably the event is not open to the general public.<br /><br />Regards TWB</div>

The Midleton launch is invite-only (I didn't get one either, though I'd like to write about it, obviously).<br /><br />Actually, I do list IWS member-only events. That's because I list all the other IWS events so it might be misleading to omit one or two during the year. I don't want to steer anyone wrong.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi IWC, we'll have to agree to disagree. I believe Luke was right to post it in the Society section - afterall, we now know that the Irish Whiskey Society President will be officially representing the Society at the event (whatever exactly the event is going to consist of nobody seems to know). If that isn't Society news I don't know what is, so it should be moved back to the Society section, imho.</div>

If your familiar with the twitter thing I'd recommend you check there. <br />I've managed to set up something that sends me a text message when a new tweet is made. Allot easier to understand for a country chap like myself. <br />I recommend putting you phone on silent at night too 6:49 4/9/13 what a ungodly hour. I'm rural but I don't milk cows!</div>

				<div class="content">Lot going on there all day. The new Paddy packaging on show alright @<br />one display but saw no Paddy 7yr. old launch anywhere. Not saying that it didn't<br />occur in some other part of Heritage Centre only that it wasn't apparent. Really<br />a celebration of the huge developments that have taken place over the last year.<br />What was the old Military infirmary ( pre 1825 ) is now the ' Irish Whiskey Academy '.<br />The attention to detail and the workmanship on the project is quite spectacular.</div>

				<div class="content">Just to clarify guys,we use a fairly simple rule of thumb. Anything organized by the society or directly related to the Society goes in the society forum. However We don't regard a scenario of selected members being invited to various PR events as society forum criteria.<br /><br />I.e. we had a member attend an Irishmam relaunch in the T2 in Dublin Airport lately too.<br /><br />However I agree that members should be made aware of all events the the Society is represented at and I would expect that any such invites should be made public to all members as it keeps members activitities open and above board.<br /><br />Further no All-pol-gies required, it's not a big deal. I just like to keep things neat  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Keep up the in interaction guys its what keeps the forum going and god I don't look in here much lately.</div>

				<div class="content">In my opinion, where an elected Committee member attends any whiskey-related event in their capacity as a Committee member it should be noted somewhere on the website (I would imagine the Society section would be most appropriate). For transparency purposes if not simply as a courtesy to the members they represent. That should be true of any benefit conferred on an elected member by a drinks company. Again, just my opinion, maybe others disagree.</div>

				<div class="content">It would also be useful to mention that committee members were here or there to help entice new members on to the committee. Everyone knows that being on a committee involves work but sometimes, in the line of duty, being on the IWS committee means a peek behind the scenes, or a meeting with someone in the biz. I'd recommend anyone into their whiskey to consider a spell on the committee, for the industry insight.</div>
