				<div class="content">Hi Joe, <br /><br />These days your best bet is using forums like ours and you can do so here as long as prices and negotiations are not discussed openly on this forum. <br />It's alright for look for ballpark values of bottles as this is quite subjective but not ok to make or recieve any direct offers.<br /><br />However you can also contact Specialist retailers like The Celtic Whiskey Shop on Dawson st in Dublin or The Whisky Exchange in London to see if they would be interested.<br /><br />There are also some specialist auctions for whiskey too but your main issue would be getting your bottle to the aution.<br /><br />McTears in Scotland<br />Whiskyauction.com (Germany)<br />Whiskeyauction.co.uk (UK)<br /><br />Feel free to post a list</div>
