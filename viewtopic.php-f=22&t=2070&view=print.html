				<div class="content">Thanks for bringing this up Luke. I've been ranting to reps about this. The price went up a few month ago. The budget only added €2. I mentioned before about buying Redbreast for €35 on sale in Supervalu a few years back. Now it nearly double the price. <br /><br />I would normally treat myself and some friends to a few bottles but now I find myself looking for better value. I'm sure lots of others are the same. <br /><br />You can buy a great Japanese/Scotch of equal age or quality for far less. Luke mentioned a good value Glendronach the other day. The Yamazaki 18 for €115 is an interesting example. The Jameson 18 is €125/130. <br /><br />I feel Irish whiskey fans are been priced out. This can't be good for the industry. I wonder have the prices affected sales in shops like CWS. <br /><br />I'm working in the industry too and know we'll suffer because of the increases. <br /><br />I really fear the are killing the goose that lays the golden egg. They should look at the property bubble alright and think of the bust.</div>

				<div class="content">The Redbreast 15 is equally eye watering.<br /><br />Rebreast 12 is £28 here in Sainburys and has been for the past lot of months. The 15 can be had for £75. Midleton VR is £97. I can't believe the prices you boys South of the border are forced to pay.</div>
