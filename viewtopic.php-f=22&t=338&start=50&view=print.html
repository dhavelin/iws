Just goes to show how reliable the grape vine is. <br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>I remember they &quot;found&quot; some more around 2008.

L5 on your redbreast is 2005 currently it should be L0 for 2010.<br /><br />These really only became standard in the very late 90's so unless there is a change to a 2 digit year there is possible confusion from decade to decade but the way packaging goes these days you should be able to guess which decade and the digit clarifies the actual year.<br /><br />The rest is batch code which I think can be company specific and can actually date the bottle to a time and batch run for quality issue identification. But this code is not obviously apparent as to what is what.</div>

Which leaves 3071, perhaps the code for the bottling line.</div>
