				<div class="content">Selling my collection…..<br /><br />originally posted in Feb but still a lot left...if anyone's looking for some pressies before Christmas....<br /><br />Hi!<br /><br />First time poster so go easy on me!<br /><br />Well I started collecting Irish Whiskey a few years ago. Well, I'm now pregnant with my first child (yay!) and obviously am not consuming alcohol at the moment. With that in mind I looked at my collection (&quot;collection&quot; may be an exaggeration!) the other day and realised that I don't miss it and right now I feel I will never return to alcohol consumption again…….I say this now in sincerity, I may of course regret this further down the line! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So, I'm looking to sell my &quot;collection&quot;…..it mainly consists of IDL Whiskeys, but I have some Bushmills expressions too. I have more than one of pretty much all of the following if anyone is interested:<br />Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy<br />Midleton Very Rare 2012<br />Redbreast 15 Year Old<br />Redbreast 12 Year Old<br />Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength Batch 1<br />Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength Batch 2<br />Green Spot<br />Yellow Spot<br />Powers Signature Release (US only expression I think, though not 100% certain on that)<br />Powers Johns Lane<br />Bushmills 10 Year Old<br />Bushmills 16 Year Old<br />Bushmills 21 Year Old Madeira Finish<br /><br />On most of the above I have the 750ml versions as I lived in the US until recently so there's extra value there lol.<br /><br />And now the really good stuff:<br />Jameson Vintage Reserve 2007 <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://shop.jamesonwhiskey.com/collecti">http://shop.jamesonwhiskey.com/collecti</a><!-- m --> ... ge-reserve Beautiful packaging if you haven't seen them before.<br />Jameson &quot;Thanks a Million&quot; Bottle - never for sale to general public, I paid a small fortune for this…:( Apparently only 1500 made.<br /><br />I'm selling all of them slightly below cost if anyone is interested (though I'm not looking to be fleeced!)? Might make for slightly cheaper presents…..<br /><br />The two Jamesons at the end however I won't part with cheaply however.<br /><br />Drop me a line if you're interested.<br />MissMoo</div>

				<div class="content">Hi MissMoo,<br /><br />Congratulations on you pregnancy. <br /><br />I'm asking a few questions for other readers. <br /><br />Wher are you based? <br /><br />I'm assuming the the Jameson RVR has the black case as opposed to the timber one! The link took to long to open.<br /><br />Will you be selling as a single lot or separately? <br /><br />It's a nice starter collection. <br /><br />Best wishes.</div>
