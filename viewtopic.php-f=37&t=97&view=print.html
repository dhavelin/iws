				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />Just a quick word of thanks to the Committee for organising the blind tasting on some of the standard Irish expressions. It certainly opened my eyes! It was very well organised, presented and the accompanying detail in terms of the composition and history of the whiskeys was very welcome also.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one!<br /><br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">A real shocker there I must say.  I've always thought Kilbeggan to be a quite mild session whiskey if sometimes too much like a scotch blend.  And Greenore in no.2!!!  Way too light I would have thought to be ranked.  Very interesting and great that it can be done.</div>

				<div class="content">That is the great reason to have these tasting as we can get too used to whiskey that is slightly a step above and it is then easy to dismiss regular whiskeys ... it is only when you taste these against each other that you get a true idea of how each fits into place agianst each other rather than comparing them against higher quality whiskeys which we are all guilt of. <br /><br />On a side note ... this is where people don't understand Jim Murray ... He scores whiskeys in their categorys.<br /><br />A 95 pointer single malt is not neccessairly the same as a 95 pointer blend. We will probably still not agree with him but  it is a something just to keep in mind.</div>

				<div class="content">I was surprised how poor the basic Bush and Jemmy actually are, not having dabbled with either for some time.<br />The session was a real eye opener for many of those present, and was very educational, thanks to Leo's splendid and informative introductions to the whiskeys, which were all served blind.<br />Perhaps the Greenore scored so well because it hangs together nicely. Sure it's bland, but it's meant to be. It does what it says it will do, and would serve anyone well on the rocks on a nice summer's day like today.<br />Fair play to Powers. Still a great whiskey and people's palates confirmed that.</div>
