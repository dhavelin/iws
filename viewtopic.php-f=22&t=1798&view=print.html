Obviously the Dingle Distillery are well on track at this stage however The Dingle Brewing Company look a long way from distilling as they don't even have pot stills in yet. They do the have a space set aside for them though <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />. They are niftily going to transfer the current brew set up (wash backs etc) for the distilling operation. They have a much bigger brewing operation in an industrial estate so don't really require the brew facility in the old Creamery building any longer. Will have to keep a close eye on them.</div>

				<div class="content">I too was hoping to warm up the stills this year but there are a few issues to resolve first  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Looking forward to new whiskeys and hopefully they will cause a domino effect in the industry. We could soon be hosting lots more tastings. It's all good new. <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
