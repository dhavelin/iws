				<div class="content">The committee have the pleasure in announcing that the last official tasting of the year will be a premium tasting which will take place on the 25th November in Brooks Hotel.<br /><br />We can already confirm it will be available to members at the normal €10 price as a thank you for your support in 2009, so it will be definitely one not to miss. <br /><br />Non-members, newbies and guests can participate at a very reasonable €20 on this occasion.<br /><br />Forum members are encouraged to suggest bottles that they would like the opportunity to taste at this event.<br /><br />We have set aside a larger than normal budget for this one. So we want to stretch that as far as possible to deliver a memorable night. The suggested format is 3 Irish and 3 Scotch (flexible)<br /><br />Ideas and suggestions please.</div>

				<div class="content">Well approximately double the normal budget, I'm trying to get the best whiskey possible for around €80 -€100 average, so we can go slightly over on one bottle if we get something interesting for slightly less!</div>

				<div class="content">I can also offer a bottle of the Bushmills rum cask or Bushmills single bourbon cask 14 yo (bottled a few years back, not the one Ally currently is selling.)<br />I also have a spare Midleton VR 2007 without a box which could suit being opened, as it's not collectable in its current state. You could have my Greenore 15 yo too. I've never opened it, and when I did get to taste it, I found I liked the 8 yo better!<br />There is that 60s Redbreast too, but we might want to hold that back for a chronological Redbreast tasting or a pps tasting at some point.</div>

				<div class="content">I have had a Lamerlaw that was very good. I think, potentially, you can make good whisky almost anywhere in the world. I don't think there's any terrior when it comes to whisky. You can grow barley nearly anywhere. Already, within the established whisky-producing nations, there is a wide variety of climates.</div>

				<div class="content">Technically, you could.<br />I'm just not convinced that the know-how and traditional expertise in whiskey distillation exists in great amounts outside the five countries I named. But I'm open to being persuaded by evidence to the contrary!<br />Anyhow, it's maybe a debate for another thread. I'll stop spamming this one and leave it for its intended purpose - for people to discuss what premium drams they'd like to sample in November.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Luke, <br /><br />your generous offer is much appreciated,<br /><br />The committee has already agreed the November tasting will be Irish only, and as we already have 2 special Bushmills bottles lined up for this tasting,  we will pass on this for now.<br /><br />We hope to have a PPS only tasting in 2010.<br /><br />The CWS single cask will be a 14 year old pure pot still bourbon cask, similar to the Greenspot 12 year old single cask. It's characteristics are closer to a greenspot than the sherried redbreast 12/15.<br /><br />I will keep note of your other offers and might approach you in 2010 for one of the other tastings (FOC or otherwise)<br /><br />Thanks again</div>
