				<div class="content">I don't know if anyone else out there is into films, but the British director Ken Loach has just won the Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival for a movie called The Angel's Share.<br /><br />It's about a Scottish criminal doing community service who is brought on a distillary tour. They find out he has an excellent nose, and he finds out about the angel's share. There's a cask of extremely rare malt going up for auction for one million, he decides to increase the angel's share and sell on a few bottles to a crooked collector. Here's a link to a review from the whiskey advocate blog:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.whiskyadvocateblog.com/2012/05/25/review-the-angels-share-the-movie-that-is/" class="postlink">http://www.whiskyadvocateblog.com/2012/05/25/review-the-angels-share-the-movie-that-is/</a><br /><br />It's showing in the IFI cinema in Temple Bar (Eustace Street) from the 1st to the 21st of June, if anyone is interested.</div>
