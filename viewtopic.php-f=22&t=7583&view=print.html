				<div class="content">Has anyone seen or tried this? Looks incredible from the pictures, a little too incredible. Could it get that red just from a sherry cask? I do like sherry aged whiskies though and would love to give it a try.  Only ones I see for sale are in Ireland or Germany.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, I've been eying this up also. I'm guessing by the really red colour that it is natural as they hardly would consider colouring it that way if it was added colour ? <br /><br />Would They ??? <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" /></div>

				<div class="content">Sounds good. Could ship from Ireland, where it doubles+ the cost. Germany has much better shipping rates but the shops that ship to the USA don't have it. Germany-only shops all seem to have it. Daily Drams, please pick this up!</div>

				<div class="content">Got an email from Binnys, probably the largest importer in Chicago, and they were told by Walsh that there was zero allotment for the US of A. Cask strength is coming though, which is nice...</div>
