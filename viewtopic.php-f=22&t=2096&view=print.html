Anyone who orders a good irish whiskey give them a pre-printed tasting notes sheet and a pencil. Most won't fill it out but those that do will see it as a good schtick and you can compile the overall tasting notes from their responses. <br /><br />If you really want to go all out, you could create a taste compass or board, with two axes - light&amp;fragrant / heavy &amp; spicy on one axis, then sweet &amp; floral / savory and rich on the other. Then you can put stickers or chalk marks for each whiskey and customers who buy the whiskey can ask that it be moved across. Each whiskey will thus have a customer chosen place in one of four quadrants. Powers John Lane would be (IMO) top right corner in the heavy&amp;spicy / savory and rich quadrant, while greenore 8 would be in the bottom left light&amp;fragrant / sweet &amp; floral. <br /><br />Here is the Diageo tasting map for scottish whiskey:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.google.ie/search?q=whiskey+flavour+map&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;imgil=lJ_9E5SrkMNs5M%253A%253Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fencrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcSwxqQFm56wp3JZgbrio0ldJe95-yLyt1BqzfRLRtxK153jsOxYZQ%253B608%253B609%253BFzuNSBCpWc7SFM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.malts.com%25252Findex.php%25252Fen_gb%25252FChoosing-Whisky%25252FA-World-of-Flavour%25252FThe-Single-Malt-Whisky-Flavour-Map&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=30XNUpmtCqKJ7Aa924HoDQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q9QEwAA&amp;biw=1092&amp;bih=532#facrc=_&amp;imgrc=lJ_9E5SrkMNs5M%3A%3BFzuNSBCpWc7SFM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.malts.com%252Fvar%252Fplain_site%252Fstorage%252Fimages%252Fchoosing-whisky%252Fa-world-of-flavour%252Fthe-single-malt-whisky-flavour-map%252Fa-guide-to-flavours%252F1337-27-eng-GB%252FA-Guide-to-Flavours.png%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.malts.com%252Findex.php%252Fen_gb%252FChoosing-Whisky%252FA-World-of-Flavour%252FThe-Single-Malt-Whisky-Flavour-Map%3B608%3B609">https://www.google.ie/search?q=whiskey+ ...

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>patricksparis wrote:</cite>im waiting on one delivery, then i will post the menu, i havent done tasting notes yet either</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />An idea maybe would be to take 30 or so whiskeys that will be fairly regular on the shelf and do a detailed menu on those. And then you can have a general comment of saying please feel free to peruse the rest of our many other rare and limited whiskeys at the whiskey bar.<br /><br />Therefore when you empty a bottle that is hard to replace then at least you don't have the headache of updating or crossing it off the menu.  <br /><br />Other ideas are to arrange your whiskeys by cost rather than brand (eventhough by brand may look aesthetically better) to make selection for punters less daunting. So have a 5Euro section 7.50, 10, 15, 20 etc and have them clearly delinated for ease of purchase. This will make choices for the buyer much less intimidating as many people would be embarrassed asking for prices of whiskey after whiskey before making their choice.<br /><br />Just ideas as I'm sure you know your bar a clientele far better than I do</div>
