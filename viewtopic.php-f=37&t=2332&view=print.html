				<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br />The Whiskey Bar of The Year Awards closes this Friday and was wondering if any one out there might consider us for a nomination. <br /><br />We are new to the Society and I'm not sure if its' politically correct' to even ask but we would really love to get a few votes or even a mention. <br /><br />The bar is Garavan's Bar in Galway and it would be fantastic just even get a mention as we have been expanding our range quite a bit over the last few years and we currently have approximately 120 Whiskeys and growing. <br /><br />I hope I haven't broken any rules of the Society/ Forum. <br /><br />Thanks again for considering. <br /><br />Paul. <br />Cheers.</div>

				<div class="content">Best of luck Paul.<br /><br />We should also thank Dick Macks in Dingle for helping with the now Society tasting down there. Perhaps we could start one with you too. That would have 2 provinces covered.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks so much for your reply, hopefully we might get a mention somewhere in the competition.<br /><br />I mentioned this to a few customers from time to time about a society and to be honest there was not much of a response. The feeling I got was people certainly liked trying new whiskeys but felt that they might be out of there league when it came to a society meeting. I might try a few whiskey appreciators again and see how it goes.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />Best wishes.<br /><br />Paul.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Patricksparis,<br />There was a section for Ulster / Munster / Leinster and Connaught and one section for International.<br /><br />I think the voting may have closed at this stage, the deadline was the 12th of September, but rest assured you have one vote as I voted for you in the International Category.<br /><br />Best of luck.<br /><br /><br />Paul.</div>

Some society members came to it but most were locals. Most tastings I've went to over the years were attended by enthusiasts. I love trying different ones and its great going to tasting because it easier to try a sample rather than buying a bottle. <br /><br />I know there are a group a lads in Clare who regularly try out different whiskeys and yet they are not affiliated with a society. I don't know what pub they go to but I'll have to look it up when I'm in Clare next.<br /><br />I done a tasting in <a href="http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/events/2014/2014-03-07" class="postlink">Wexford</a> in March at it was attended by locals too. Only a couple of those who attended would have any experience with whiskey.  <br /><br />Dick Macks has a great selection now, the tastings allowed them to get some exposure and I know the manager Finn said people come in because of  different whiskeys. <br /><br />I know there will be a couple of tastings outside of Cork &amp; Dublin over the next while.</div>
