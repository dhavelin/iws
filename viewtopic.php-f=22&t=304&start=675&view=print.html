I can't fault it - delicious.<br /><br />Connemara Cask Strength 57.9%. A slight varnish on the palate at first, but fades with the second sip. I had this bottling before, love it.</div>

				<div class="content">I've had a bottle of Tullamore Dew at home for a few years but always moved it aside for something more &quot;fashionable&quot; until last night where I said ok buddy let's see how raw your going to leave my throat. To my amazement I must say that apart from a spicy burst on initial taste that there was little of the coarseness that I was expecting. According to the 2011 Whiskey bible the recent bottlings are smoother but this is at least 6 years old - interesting!?<br />Back to the dram itself, I really thought that this was a fantastic whiskey that had plenty of pot still character in it much like Powers but maybe the finish wasn't as good as Powers but still I am looking forward to taking it out again tonight and I recommend it heartily to anyone like myself how thought they were to cool to &quot;Dew&quot;.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd tried a sample previously, this is my first full bottle. It's gets better with each session, i don't know if that's the whisky breathing or my taste buds response to the whisky becoming more appreciative, but i'm looking forward to the next session. I'm a bit lazy with the note taking these days, but if i take any i'll post them up.</div>

				<div class="content">A classic, the standard Jameson. Spine tingling barley and grain with that hard edge. Moments of complexity, but an uneventful ( short ) finish. A great pub whisky though - one of the best.<br /><br /><br />Jamesons Gold Reserve. A step up on the standard. More complex and oakier. Oddly full of coffee straight after the standard.<br /><br /><br />Connemara Single Cask 4332 46%. Put into cask 4.9.92 and bottled 25.6.08. Typical Connamara with fruit and peat, quite Ardbegish. Imo.<br /><br /><br />Connemara Cask Strength 57.9%. Quite a serious initial hit, i always get that varnish note at first, a pleasant one. Good stuff.</div>
