				<div class="content">I'm sure I am not the only friend of Laphroaig on here....<br /><br />but figured i would post up the info from the april mailing.<br /><br />there was also something about new t-shirts, Laphroaig Cheese and a new museum, but below I have just put in the good stuff......<br /><br /><br />    *  *  *<br /><br />Laphroaig 18 year old<br /><br />This is a fantastic new expression that is replacing our venerable 15 Year Old. It is not without shedding a tear or two that I wave goodbye to our multi award winning &quot;15&quot;. I have been to our warehouse in Glasgow and retrieved the last 65 bottles. For the collectors amongst you I have made 30 available for &quot;Friends&quot; on a first come first served basis.<br /><br />But frankly the new &quot;18&quot; has a flavour to behold. Not only has it enjoyed the extra 3years sleep, we have bottled it at the higher strength of 48% ABV and thus avoided the chill filtering process. It is absolutely delicious and I hope to have some of the first bottling available for you in a month or two.<br /><br />Triple Wood<br /><br />As you can imagine I have had many requests for this new expression. I am afraid that the first bottling was designated for duty free in the one litre size. However the second bottling will occur in late summer and I will make Triple Wood available for you just as soon as I can.<br /><br />Single Batch 10 year old cask strength<br /><br />Those who saw my Christmas broadcast will have heard about the change. Rather than trying to match each batch that is bottled we are going to let each bottling &quot;live&quot;  as an individual in its own right. This is I think the more natural way as each batch is effectively bottled straight from the barrel. This means each bottling will vary but that is all part of single malts. Edition No1 will be bottled shortly and again I hope to make some available to you.<br /><br />Sláinte,<br /><br />John Campbell</div>

				<div class="content">Okay got my grubby hands on the 18yo after long last. Thanks to the WhiskeyBro who sourced me one from Ally and delivered it to the door  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Anyway was really looking forward to it and opened it on arrival  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />I had no expectation on this and decided to read very little about so as not to create any prejudices in mind before tasting  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Well it did not disappoint either but not what I was expecting, don't really know what I was expecting actually.<br /><br />It had much more bite than I expected for an 18yo Islay. The 15yo &amp; 30yo had made me think a smoothing out of the iodine &amp; smoke with age. However the 18 (and possibly due to the 48%) seemed more intense than the 15yo which is a really smoothie to me. <br /><br />Nose: A good waft of smoke and plenty iodine, sea air, dried seaweed etc all layered with vanilla and chocolate toffees<br />Taste: a sweet yet acrid iodine, pure almond essence and plenty of toffee sweetness<br />Finish: did not note the finish  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> <br /><br />Really need to have another go at this but I really like it. However I cannot say it is any better or worse than the 15yo as I really like the 15yo too. For me these are 2 very different whiskies for different moods. And another Laphroaig I have to add to my ever expanding must haves  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">As I mentioned to [shouted at] you the other night, I think Laphroiag 18 YO is an absolute cracker!<br /><br />Good to hear you got a taste at last!<br /><br />L.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I forgot to add - the finish (to my jaded palate) is suprisingly smooth with a little phenolic &quot;spike&quot; at the end.</div>
