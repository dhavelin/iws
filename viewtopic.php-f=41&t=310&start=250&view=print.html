				<div class="content">As someone who buys whiskey for a personal collection and for future consumption, if love to try some of these old whiskies. I'd certainly pay as much as I would for a top quality contemporary bottle, even if they are fairly standard bottles from yesteryear. <br /><br />I wouldn't be able to justify spending more than €100 on one though, yet they are trying to sell them for €300-500 a piece (based on 8 bottles for €2,700 to €4000).<br /><br />I wonder do all these old bottles just end up on the shelves of pubs and such?</div>

So where ever it ends that is the price. You can be lucky or you can see mad prices.<br /><br />However never take any one auction as a true reflection of a price but a probably an average of several auctions is more reflective.</div>

				<div class="content">If you get multiple bottles is spreads the cost of postage. If you were getting say the Paddy, a Tullamore and Tyrconnell say. The cost was €34 I think. Postage is €23 and handling is €9. That comes to €66. It may still be cheaper that the shops but it's not value. <br /><br />I usually factor this in before I bid. I usually get a few bottles because if you get one it's €19+ €3 handling. I managed to get some nice older bottles and a few cheap one. I would have saved myself €50+ and got a few rare ones.<br /><br />Other auctions charge commission, sometimes 16% and VAT on top and this can drive the costs up.  If you need to get them posted than the cost is often not worth it. <br />I try take it in account at all auctions. It's worth while making a list before and give yourself a max price. It's sticking to this that's the problem.</div>

Around €150/160 I'm guessing. Cheap for the buyer. It's a pity that there wasn't more Irish whiskeys.</div>
