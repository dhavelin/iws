I will make my best efforts to drop in, though we will likely only be in the country for one week so time may be limited.  I will keep in touch about this as our plans start to take shape.</div>

				<div class="content">I was trying to find out if there was ever more than one batch per year. Say a B2/13 or something. I've never seen one. <br /><br />Here's the batches so far<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">B1/11</span> 57.7%<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">B1/12</span> 58.6%<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">B1/13</span> 59.9%<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">B1/14</span> 58.2%<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">B1/15</span> 57.4%<br /><br />I was going to plot the graph but thats a bit sad. <br /><br />I haven't tried the 14 yet but hopefully soon. They're a nice treat every year if your not into Midletons or prefer the change.</div>

				<div class="content">Jurgen's Whisky Huis in Belgium has a 13. I didn't see any 14's but I'm was using the phone so it's limited. The price is reasonable too. I don't know what postage would be but I'm sure if your getting more than one it'll work out cheaper. <br /><br />If you find a 14 keep me posted too.</div>
