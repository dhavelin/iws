				<div class="content">I been doing some research into Andrew Jameson's Distillery in Wexford. I believe it's called the Fairfield Distillery but need better proof. I know from The Lost Distilleries Of Ireland by Brian Townsend that it's still was licensed and contained 200 gallons.<br /><br />I will soon be uploading photos of the general area and some ruins around the area.<br />If anyone has knowledge of the distillery it would be most appreciated. <br />The local river was the Urrin which flow into the Slaney just south of Enniscorthy.<br />One intriguing landmark near by is a lovely bridge called the Venona Bridge,the name alone must have a story.<br />I add more as soon as i can get accurate information.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm attaching an old ordnance survey map of the area near Enniscorthy.<br /><br />The B&amp;W image shows Monard House in the top left of the photo, it is now Monard Spa.<br /><br />On the bottom right there is a castle called Daphney Castle, this was Andrew Jamesons' home. Sadly it fell into disrepair and had to be demolished some years ago.</div>

				<div class="content">Finding information  on the Fairfield distillery is quite difficult ,but I have recently stumbled upon a mention in &quot;Chemistry, Theoretical, Practical, and Analytical: As Applied and Relating to the Arts and Manufactures, Volume 1&quot; by Sheridan Muspratt, Glasgow 1860 ... Page 113  in the section called Alcohol - Potato Spirit. ...last paragraph ....

				<div class="content">Nice find Charley. I wondered was there much distilling being done with potatoes. I'd assume it was marketed as a vodka like spirit and not aged in casks. Although it would have been transported in casks. I'm curious about this now. <br /><br />I wonder was this around the time Fairfield distillery was closed up. It's hard to get any information on it considering the family involved.</div>

				<div class="content">My own feeling is that Jameson probably lost interest in the venture after the divorce from his wife Catherine and then was caught up in his own new marriage .  His daughter Helen married A Davis founder of S&amp; AG Davis flour mills ,the distillery had passed to Davis family who converted it into a flour mill. As the site was operating as a flour mill by mid 1830's it did not last long as a distillery for any great length of time after the divorce.  The last mention that I have seen in print , is in &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot;  Samual Lewis 1837. There is mention of the flour mill in Bassetts Wexford Co Guide and Directory of 1885.an ad on page 295 and a resume of the business on page 295 .<br />The reason for the distillation of potatoes is a bit of a mystery. Fr Matthews campaigns are usually given as a reason <br />for the closure of the distillery, although as he did not get into his stride until 1838 ,this cannot be the case. Perhaps he was trying to diversify by turning Fairfield into a 19th century Ceimici Teo !</div>

				<div class="content">Regarding the Fairfield distillery there is still a portion of the original building to be seen , although this is not apparent when viewed from the main road as the modern factory building obscures the lines .<br />Looking at the old Ordinance Survey map we can see a L shaped store at the rear of the site . This is the building that still survives.. photos and map follow.</div>

See the comment in the attached extract from &quot;Travels in Ireland &quot; by  Johann Georg Kohl  1844. At that date only one distillery was operating i.e Bishopswater. New Ross having closed in 1844 and Enniscorthy in 1840 . However he makes the intriguing remark that there were once 7 distilleries in Wexford, which means that we have one to find!<div class="inline-attachment">
