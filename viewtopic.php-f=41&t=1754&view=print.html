				<div class="content">Hi there everyone<br />Dad has been clearing out some dusty old bottles following a conversation with one of his old friends regarding the value of some of dads old whiskies. One in particular was presented to him 31years ago in Larne during a Round Table Celebration dinner as guest speaker. Apparently it was drawn from one of the last casks at Comber. It says on the bottle Old Comber 30 years old, dad thinks the distillery closed many years ago, I was wondering if any one has any background information on this whiskey and whether we should open it and enjoy or perhaps give it value? its box is in very good condition unopened perhaps a little dusty. kindest regards Emma</div>

				<div class="content">If it's the standards Old Comber 30, it would be around â‚¬300 and up, I think. It was more than one cask, but from the last casks of the distillery. Originally for sale for 30 quid, or thereabouts. It's quite a nice whiskey and worth tasting for the experience, but you can get better whiskeys for much cheaper. <br /><br />A picture would tell us a lot.</div>
