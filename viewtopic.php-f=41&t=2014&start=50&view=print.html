				<div class="content">There's an empty bottle of Dunvilles on adverts.ie for €800. It claims to be 1908-1914 but would need more examination to be sure. The mad thing is that someone has offered €75 for it. I wonder what I could dig out that I could cash in on.</div>

				<div class="content">Picked this up recently.  It's metal and about 45x60cm.  No real great idea on age but it has plenty of rust.  It does say by royal appointment- not the more typical &quot;by appointment to...&quot;. The seal doesn't have as much detail as the old labels.  I'm thinking the slot in front was a place for coupons, flyers, or a calendar.  One more interesting tidbit - It was shipped from India - not sure how it made its way there.<br /><br />If anyone has any insight feel free to share.  Thanks!</div>

The old maps in Midleton <br />that showed areas of distribution quite literally (pre 1922) showed<br />the whole Empire as being the market. Very interesting item.</div>

Never came across Irish Whiskey from<br />A bonder etc. Coming in a similar type vessel. The top one is a jug of a type used up till the 1980's to bottle 'potcheen'<br />Which was done by Woodford Bourne here in Cork. I've a feeling that they could be the product of the Irish pub phenomenon <br />of the 1990's onward. In the end there was'nt enough bric a brac to go around to ship out to the various places where pubs we're opening and as a result they had to improvise and make up new stuff. Definitely have seen other stuff that arose in this way. As some pubs close up or get themed into the next new big craze then the old accessories end up on e-bay etc.<br /><br />If you cannot physically handle/examine the item then the dictum of 'caveat emptor' definitely applies .</div>

				<div class="content">I'm inclined to agree with you too Raven. It looks like a mix of Jameson &amp; Corrys. It looks a Woodford &amp; Bourne Poitin and there's a similar Poitin bottle to the second one as well. <br /><br />We could be completely wrong of course too.</div>
