				<div class="content">Just did a blind tasting of 3 different batches - 2005, 2009 and 2012.<br />It's often been said that none of the later ones match up to the first 2005 bottlings but there's been so much new SPS lately to muddy the water I thought I go back and do it blind to see if my preferences hold up without preconceptions.<br /><br />Interestingly (well to me) the least favourite and the only one I positively identified was the 2009. I find the old potstill mustiness has a slightly bitter tang on this one. <br /><br />The other two were quite different from this and from each other but I couldn't pick a favourite or tell which was which. One had a slight touch more of the old mustiness, while the other was more related to the current RB 12 yr old - older and softer. Anyway the former was the 2005, the latter the 2012.<br /><br />I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has done this and what the result were.</div>
