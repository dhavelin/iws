				<div class="content">The problem with bottles like these is that we have no way of knowing where the whiskey is from. <br /><br />These spurious bottlings were 2 a penny back in the day and really very hard to verify unless you have solid information.<br /><br />So I just ignore such bottlings unless I know where they were distilled.<br /><br />It does seem to say pot still on the bottle though which may be worth researching but still a blend so don't think it is worth the asking money. Would be lovely to have as a curio though.<br /><br />The Old Irish Gold I provided for the Presidents Tasting in November was an unattributed 15yo Pot Still bottled in the 70's and actually turned out to be a disappointment. So if I had paid $400 dollars I would have been a bit miffed.  <br /><br />.</div>

				<div class="content">Both eBay and Paypal should cover it. It's a real pain to have to try and get a refund from a seller that is reluctant to give it to you. You only have a limited time to alert eBay. The worry i have here is that the seller has time to take your money and close their account with Paypal and eBay. Because they are not an established seller they don't have to worry about their reputation.<br /> It's easy to set up an email account/ Paypal account if you have numerous credit cards and start a new eBay account without too many questions.<br /><br />I'll keep an eye on it to see what happens. I would love to have one in my collection all the same.</div>

Anytime ive ever had a problem on ebay I have been able to get my money back if item didnt arrive or winner never bought it (though there is a timeframe as mentioned above).
