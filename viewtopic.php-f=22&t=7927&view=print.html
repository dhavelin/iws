				<div class="content">Well the fact it has green glass may well mean it is not as old as you may think so not very very old <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> .<br /><br />These labels were in use up to the 60's and the fact it is from a pub would explain the old stained look. Tobacco smoke etc<br /><br />However very hard to gauge by the picture you have submitted as we'd need to see the whole bottle.<br /><br />It does look bigger than a normal bottle though which could add value but may just be the picture. <br /><br />Does it still have the contents? An empty bottle will not be worth much unfortunately.</div>

				<div class="content">Mnuke33 - Hello there!<br /><br />A few months ago you posted here about an older bottle of Jameson found in an old pub,<br />and I see that you did not receive much in the way of answers to your questions on this...<br /><br />I was very interested in researching this for you... Do you still have this bottle, and could I <br />ask you to add a few clear photos of the Cap &amp; content levels ?!? (The best photos will need<br />to be taken with the bottle in a standing position, and with a bit of back-light behind the <br />dark glass...Perhaps if the photo could be taken from a window sill?)<br /><br />From my preliminary research into your bottle, I do believe this was produced before the <br />1930s based on the style of the neck label... (Pre-1930's bottles bear a neck label showing<br />3 large stars, and no &quot;JJ&amp;S&quot; in the center of the neck label). <br /><br />The inclusion of the &quot;boxed&quot; Serial # (4812) leads me to also believe that this was produced <br />after WWI, and sometime in the 1920's...There are very few examples of labels bearing these <br />'boxed' Serial #s, but all of them are found on bottles that were filled by local retailers with <br />labels from provided them by JJ&amp;S. (<span style="font-style: italic">Note that none of these bottles were filled by JJ&amp;S or <br />the Bow Street distillery.</span>)<br /><br />Or the examples I have on file, Serial # 1001 was identified by an auction house as being from <br />1919, and Serial # 14731 is the highest recorded serial number I have on file... As to date, I've<br />found no known examples of this 'local bottling label' that can be identified to 1930 or later.<br /><br />I will look forward to hearing from you, and helping you with researching your bottle!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Walter C Hurst</div>
