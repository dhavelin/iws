				<div class="content">Hi Z,<br /><br />Just to let you know that your taking absentee bids you need to take a start bid and a top bid from every one. This is to actually to get your start bid and then in the auction on the night any persons there can bid but still may be up against an absentee bid.<br /><br />I would also suggest do it in €5 bids or you might scare people away.<br /><br />It would work like this.<br /><br />Say you get 3 absentee bids from Curly, Larry &amp; Moe.<br /><br />Curly bids 30-40Euro, Larry 20 - 50 and Moe 70-100<br /><br />Larry would technically start the bidding at 20Euro but Curly's 30-40bid are basically out bid straight away by Larry and it would be at €45 <br />then Moe's bid comes into effect but as his start bid is 70 it goes straight to 70 and knocks out Larry.<br /><br />However at this stage the biding stops and have a 70Euro start bid for the live auction so Larry still has 30euro to play with and a max bid of €100.  <br /><br />So if you only get 2 further 5euro bids in the live auction that will only bring Moes bid to €85 so the wining bid by the absentee bidder is €85 and not €100. <br /><br />Anyway I'm sure it will all be a bit of fun.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now in saying that I think this is an excellent cause and I would like to donate a bottle to the auction also.<br /><br />If people are interested in an absentee bid I'll throw in a very collectable ...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Erin Go Bragh Single Malt 6YO</span><br /><br />Should be worth a €100 min of anybody's money.</div>

If it's just to kick off the bidding...</div></blockquote><br /><br />That is an online auction phenomenon where all bids start at the bottom. But in general auctions people do use start bids. Also a regular auctioneer very rarely starts at 0. And he usually tries to start at the lower estimate and works down from there until there is a bid or the lot is withdrawn due to lack of interest.<br /><br />For instance in car auctions people don't put in a start bid of a €5 as it serves no purpose. But if the car had an auction guide of say €10,000 you find many people (not all) put in start bids of 10-20% less than the reserve if they are really interested in the object. This is to cover the scenario that (1.) if the car does not reach it's reserve price they get to enter a decent bid &amp; (2.) the car may still be sold by auctioneer at his discretion at sometimes up to 20% under the reserve. <br /><br />So if you put in a start bid of 50% under and nobody else bided against you then the lot would be with drawn even though you may have had an upper limit over the guide price. Not sure if that is clear or not ....<br /><br />However I suppose in the case of whiskey though your point is more correct ... silly me ... getting a bit overly complex on a simple situation  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" />  It's mainly used for high value goods.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know much about auctions so I was curious. I can see that a start bid has to come from somewhere, and if there is just one absentee bidder for a lot then it could be tricky to get above the reserve, even if the bidder is willing to pay that much.<br /><br />I felt sorry for Moe in your example though. He should have paid €55 but you charged him €70. If he was present at the auction he would have paid €55 so it seems unfair. That's why I wondered why he would have submitted such a high start bid.</div>

With luck, he'll be at the auction on Thursday.<br /><br />Here's a link to the event on Facebook, by the way.
