				<div class="content">That's a 70/80's Redbreast 12. They contains whiskey from the old Jameson Distillery in Dublin. We cracked a couple open this time last year at our Redbreast tasting. They weren't a patch on the older one or the current ones but they were drank on the night. <br /><br />As for value, they are rare and this means they are worth considerably more than the current ones. I know they retail about €350+ but I'm assuming your not a shop. <br />Yours are in mint condition and I'd say its worth €250 minimum anyway. You could get more. If you tried the Celtic Whiskey Shop I'm sure they'd give €200 min for it. I'd personally say try and get more.</div>
