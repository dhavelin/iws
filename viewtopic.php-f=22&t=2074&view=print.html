				<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br /><br />My boyfriend started to collect whiskey but he is still quite 'green' collector. I would love to give him classes about whiskey as a Christmas present.<br />Does anyone know if there are such classes in Dublin?<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi and welcome. <br /><br />As a member of the Irish Whiskey Society, you get a discount at the monthly tastings. <br /><br />I've been going for the past couple of years and find them very informative. There are great whiskeys to try. We often get try sample ones that are not available yet. <br /><br />There are other tastings in the city too. Most notable is the Celtic Whiskey Shop one. I believe they are in Against the Grain pub on Wexford street. Check with the shop, as I think they are per booked.</div>

				<div class="content">not to flog ourselves over the internet but, as willie above says, the IWS tastings are as good as any 'official' class if not much better because the tastings are run by the membership for their own benefit. When a member gives advice, they're not trying to push a product (always a plus in my book) and he'd be surrounded by real enthusiasts, many of whom, (myself included) would be happy to answer all his questions and generally talk about whiskey until the sun rises. Otherwise, Against the Grain do tastings with the Celtic Whiskey Shop as do WJ Kavanaghs pub and their sister pub Mulligan Grocer. Hope that helps. <br /><br /><br />p.s. If you do send him our way, just let us know his name and when he's coming and I'll personally make sure he has a good time and that all his questions get answered</div>

				<div class="content">As mentioned by Fionán one of the big pluses of the society is the knowledge of the members which far out strips any retail outlet with few exceptions like the Celtic Whiskey Shop.<br /><br />Even if you don't buy him a €50 membership just point him in our direction and you both can come along some night just for a look/see as non members.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you guys for informative answers! <br /><br />I just have couple of questions:<br /><br />1. How does the membership work?<br />2. Is there a fee he would need to pay?<br />3. What are the benefits of joining the society?<br />4. Is it ok to join if he doesn't really know much about whiskeys?</div>

				<div class="content">1) membership is 50 euros annually, active until the anniversary of whenever you last paid. All subsequent society tastings (last thursday of every month except december) are 15 euros for members and 25 euros for non-members (so again, if you dont want to take out a full membership, feel free to come along to a tasting any time at the non-members rate)<br />2) see above.<br />3) aside from the discount on tastings which pays for itself after the first five, membership entitles you to come to all the special events (the christmas party (this year's is on december 12th), various distillery tours, tastings outside dublin, whatever other fun things various members come up with) as well as for the annual AGM presidents tasting, which is a budgetless members-only tasting of ungodly whiskeys. Members tend to get discounts at various other whiskey events not run by us (whisky live etc) and members are eligible to purchase society bottlings of whiskeys that dont exist commercially (a large part of the money that goes back into the system through the tasting tickets goes to purchasing specially selected casks of whiskey that we as a society find particularly outstanding. These are then bottled when ready and made available to members.)<br />4) absolutely!</div>

I wonder will there be something this year?</div>
