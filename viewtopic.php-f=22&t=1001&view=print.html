				<div class="content">I was reading over some previous topics and came across this one.<br />Has anyone any for 2012 since were 1/3 the way trough it.<br /><br />I'm hoping for a Yellow Spot,<br />perhaps a new one from Irishman.<br />A new 15 year old from IDL probably the rebirth of the Jameson 15 SPS.<br /><br />I hope Beam/Cooley make an statement whiskey if you know what i mean, something to announce that they have arrived. it's probably to soon but an 10/12 year old Kilbeggan at an affordable price rather than the 15/18 of late.<br /><br />Dingle should be churning out soon, i know they have spirit out there but is it Cooley(which may be drying up soon too)<br /><br />Bushmills are in hiding from what I see. Hopefully their hatching some new stuff. I hate to think their R&amp;D guys could only come up with that honey/whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">Are we still waiting for <span style="font-weight: bold">Batch 0002 of the Kilbeggan Distillery Reserve Malt</span> ? That would hopefully be an improvement on the Batch 0001. <br /><br />Maybe another cracking Whisky Live single cask like last years Tyrconnell 11yo Sherry finish. What a whiskey that was.<br /><br />How about a single cask Greenore this time ... cask strength too  <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> <br /><br />Bushmills ???? 	<img src="http://www.whiskybembel.de/sch/27.gif" alt="Image" /> Nuff said <br /><br /><br />IDL is probably the place to look again this year ...<br /><br />As you say Willie another Spot of some sort ... A Yellow/Red/Blue spot would be wonderful but I'd be nervous at the price of an older aged one. Maybe they will come out with a blend of it and obviously a better attempt at it than the last one.<br /><br />An aged stated Paddy ... any one up for that ????<br /><br />Powers 18yo  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />What I would love to see is a completely new brand ... whether that is a go-er in the minds of IDL I don't know but this braand would be their single cask release brand  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />I know wishful thinking ...<br /><br /><br />Ohh I'm getting excited now for Whisky Live Dublin as that is where it will all be revealed, me thinks <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>
