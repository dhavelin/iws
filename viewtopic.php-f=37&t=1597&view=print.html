				<div class="content">Ok, we're going for something different for our June tasting and we're opening up the floor to our members to discuss the their favourite Scotch .... <br /><br />What we're looking for is a number of volunteers to select a bottle of their favourite scotch and then explain why it is their favourite.  So take the favoured dusty bottle off the shelf and drop me an email at stephen dot young at irishwhiskeysociety dot com  <br /><br />Do not post up on the forum which bottle you intend to present, I will collate the different bottles and will select 6 bottles in total that are different enough.  We will reimburse the members for their bottles (fair market value, but capped at 50-60 euro, so unfortunately that bottle of Bowmore 64  will have to stay on the shelf)<br /><br />At the end of the evening we'll vote on who presented the most compelling case for their whisky so you'll have to be at your most convincing ....</div>

				<div class="content">Can I just say I had a great night at this event.<br /><br />Was great to meet an enthusiastic bunch of people and taste some very interesting drinks, which ranged from superb to offensive on my palette. <br /><br />Could I be cheeky and ask someone to remind me of the names of the six for future reference?</div>
