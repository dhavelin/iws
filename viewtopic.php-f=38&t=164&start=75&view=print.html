				<div class="content">This is a sample of what I'm editing right now...<br /><br />The authors studied the reduction in the linearity of traditional pseudomorphic AlGaAs/InGaAs/AlGaAs high-electron mobility transistors with planar doping in the AlGaAs layers at low temperatures. A modified structure, wherein the planar Si doping layers were positioned inside thin single GaAs quantum wells within the AlGaAs barrier layers, was shown to eliminate this degradation in linearity. Deep-level transient spectroscopy and persistent photocapacitance measurements revealed that the trapping on the DX centres was effectively removed. The linearity enhancements were therefore ascribed to the removal of this trapping. The self-consistent solutions of the Schrodinger and Poisson equations demonstrated that the transfer of the donor electrons into the channel was necessarily identical in the modified and traditional structures. <br /><br />I need another drink.</div>

				<div class="content">No, I've moved on to an old Powers. One of the ones with the black top half of the label. I think I might have got it from JohnM.<br /><br />In fact I've a couple of questions on this while there's a few of you here.<br /><br />First of all can anyone remind me when these are from - I've a vague idea it's the 80's.<br /><br />Secondly and more importantly it also has that different taste that a lot of older, even slightly older, Irish whiskeys have. Now this is a blend which I'm guessing is from the new Midleton. But it's got that same characteristic as some of the whiskeys I've tried from Bow st, Old Midleton, Tullamore and John's lane. And when I say older, I don't necessarily mean aged for longer. But it's very different from current PPS and pot still blends. Why is the modern stuff so different from the produce of the closed distilleries and the older stuff from the new one. Something has fundamentally changed in the was PPS is made. Or, and this goes against everything I think I know about whiskey, is something happening in the bottle over time?<br /><br />I should probably have posted this on the whiskey section.</div>

				<div class="content">That bottling was available in the '70s so was probably made in John's Lane. <br /><br />I'm not sure what gives it its dusty characteristic, but it's common to whiskey of that time in Bow Street, Tullamore, Midleton, John's Lane, Comber (not quite as much)... and so on.</div>

So if the Powers isn't from New Midleton is there a whiskey from there with the same thing. I think there's a touch of it in the Jameson 15 Millenium. Also the Jameson 1780s with the picture of John Jamesone have it. Any idea when they're from.</div>
