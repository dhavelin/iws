				<div class="content">Totally concur ... But as I was not there I can not even attempt to salivate over the examples you wrote about. But yes just because x goes with y does not mean x goes with y +1. Hope it was a good night as I like whiskey and chocolate but sounds like I missed out on a master class.</div>

Is there any possibility something like this will be arranged soon again? I would really love to attend because I think that the combination of Irish Whiskey and Chocolate is like the perfect equilibrium of tastes. I love to <a href="http://www.serenatachocolates.com/petals/Buy_chocolate.htm" class="postlink">buy chocolate</a> knowing that I can perfectly well just enjoy it to a glass of Irish Whiskey while reading a book or watching one of my favorite movies.</div>
