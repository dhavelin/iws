Had the bottle quite a while but only opened it the other night. On the basis of this though I may investigate further. Quite delicate but in  very good way and not lacking in subtle flavour at all.</div>

				<div class="content">Good question! All were incredible. I really preferred the 1890 but want to do the next tasting blind to put any prejudices aside. In keeping with the Stitzel-Weller line of the 2  bottles I just picked up the<br />Jeffersons Presidential Select 18yr Bourbon which was aged in old Stitzel-Weller barrels.<br />This should be a great way to compare the new with the old.</div>

And there's something special about Bunnahabhain that I didn't notice a few years ago. A great distillery.</div>

				<div class="content">Been mostly into my beer of late ... 'er in doors got me an excellent range of  beers in a hamper for Christmas. All the ales gone at this stage ... had a lovely Scottish stout last night made from malted barley which was obviously peated and was a nice touch. Had a couple Connemara's with it which complemented nicely.<br /><br />The original sherry finished offering from Cooley which is nice but no world beater .... for me that is as I think so of the Connemara's are great.<br /><br />I also had some of a sample of the Bog Oak (Thanks David H  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  ).<br /><br />This was really really nice as I tried this before at a formal tasting and found it just okay.<br /><br />Will get back to the rest later and look forward to exploring it.<br /><br /><br />Tonight had a couple Duvel's so nuff said there ... also had a Hoegaarden and now on a Sierra Nevada &quot;Kellerwais&quot;<br /><br />And Iain got me going so I'v also poured an indy 1978 Ardbeg. Could have done with a higher ABV as this is only 40% but it suits the beer fine.<br /><br />So good flavours going on in there but there are also so of these traits that I dislike in an Ardbeg there also but very pleasant all the same.</div>

				<div class="content">Having some half measures (it is only Tuesday) of a few sherry monsters - Blair Athol 12, Mortlach 16, Glenfarclas 15 and Tyrconnell 11 (Whisky Live).<br /><br />It's funny how they're all double distilled sherry matured malts and yet while the 3 Scottish ones have a lot of similarities in character the Tyrconnell is completely different. Yes I know it's from a different country but the basic ingredients are the same and even the water etc on the Cooley peninsula isn't that different from Scotland so why is it so far removed?<br /><br />(I'm preferring the Glenfarclas to the others by the way - even if that does sound contradictary).</div>
