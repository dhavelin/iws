				<div class="content">Thought I'd set up this thread after coming across a strange lot on Ebay<br /><br /><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=200352329316&amp;ssPageName=ADME:B:SS:GB:1123#ebayphotohosting" class="postlink">Item number: 200352329316</a><br /><br />Came across a lot of Irish Whiskey bottles ... look very suspicious to me and not have their lead/foil capsuls, all labels seems a bit too shiny for my liking too.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/07/!BUUE2QgBGk~$(KGrHgoH-CUEjlLl1UPiBKM7BSg+EQ~~_1.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />These apparently have come from an old Irish pub were they had been on display.<br /><br />Could well be true but I have a feeling they were empty and then refilled (tea anyone) and crudely corked.</div>

				<div class="content">Your refill theory sounds plausible. The George Roe caught my eye. In his description he says it's labeled as 53 years old (I can't confirm that from the photo). Since it was distilled in 1919, that would mean it was bottled (by Daly's on Eden Quay) in 1972. Any of you collectors come across that before?</div>

				<div class="content">Definetly all fakes. Straight from a home made pub display.<br /><br />The Jameson is in an old wine bottle,<br /><br />the labels are curved at the bottom,<br /><br />the fill levels are all wrong,<br /><br />clear bottles were less common back in the 50s &amp; 60s,<br /><br />no seals,<br /><br />look like faded colour copies,<br /><br />etc etc</div>
