				<div class="content">Hi All,<br />I have a quick question that the members may be able to answer for me.<br />As the Connemara Cask Strength and the Turf Mor are no longer available do you know if Cooley have any plans to release another version of the Turf Mor or Cask Strength.<br /><br />Maybe this has been discussed previously and if so sorry for repeating a previous topic, I am new to the Society.<br /><br />Many thanks to all.<br /><br />Paul.<br />Cheers.</div>

				<div class="content">Those were produced when Teelings owned the company. Beam stopped all experiments and only produced the main brands. They even stopped supplying Slane and other producers.<br /><br />When Sontory took over, there was a feeling that they would give them more licence to experiment  again. I know that there will be some new expressions of Kilbeggan coming. I assume they will have some ideas with the Connemara too. <br /><br />So in short I don't know but I have my fingers crossed.</div>

				<div class="content">You would have thought that a cask strength version of a Peated whiskey would be standard.<br /><br />However I presume these decisions are in some way based on previous sales etc as well as consolidation once new management came on board.<br /><br />Consolidation seems to be standard for the irish whiskey business. Jameson did it for years now Bushmills are doing it. Concentrate on the core expressions and work from there  (many years later  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  ).</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Guys for your prompt replies. <br /><br />I think I will try to get a few bottles of each, although there doesn't seem to be very much availability of either. <br /><br />I think we have seen the last of the Turf Mor but possibly as said earlier there should be a cask strength at a minimum. <br /><br />Cheers and thanks. <br /><br />Paul.</div>
