				<div class="content">I have a bottle of Midleton VR 1984 Irish Whiskey and enquiring if anybody knows what it's worth. It is still in original condition with original unused invitation to register the whiskey. Bottle No. 3142. There is some small evaporation but all seals are still intact. Appreciate any guidance on estimates of value or adice if one was to sell?</div>

				<div class="content">They retail for €700+ in whiskey shops. I've seen them for between €350/450 at auctions. I'd guess that's a good guide for private sale. <br />Don't bother posting on Donedeal/Adverts, they'll take your money and will remove the advert for selling alcohol over the net.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />One off licence in Dublin is charging €899 for that bottle. Another is charging the same for a 1985. This is retail pricing of course and includes a (generous?/ decent?) margin and VAT. Of course these bottles are in mint condition and include the box, cert etc. Everyone has access to the internet these days, so in my view you'd be lucky to pick one up these days for less than €450-500.<br /><br />One went recently on a UK auction website for £650, which is about €975 in 'our money'. This is of course the first year of Midleton so is more desirable...<br /><br />Rgds,<br />I.</div>

				<div class="content">Although it's the first year there's plenty out there. I'm surprised at the UK auction price. I'm assuming there commission too that would put it over €1000. <br /><br />I see this bottle has some evaporation which will affect the resale price greatly. Can you post a picture showing the fill level.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi GWH,<br /><br />Please see link below for the £650 one I was referring too, on the same page you'll see 2 'naked' 1984s i.e. no box and cert and they went for £360 each (€540-ish) earlier this year. I suppose Adams would be a fairly 'high end' auctioneers but still...<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.adams.ie/searchresult?auction_no=&amp;excl_keyword=&amp;gridtype=listview&amp;high_estimate=&amp;ipp=All&amp;keyword=midleton&amp;low_estimate=&amp;name=&amp;page_no=All&amp;sort_by=lot_no">http://www.adams.ie/searchresult?auctio ... _by=lot_no</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There may be a good few 1984s and 1985s still out there but getting one at the 'right money' might be tricky I'd say. Still, you never know.<br /><br />FYI, as mentioned in another post Lavery's in Belfast are offering a 1998 for £550 - over €800 in 'our money'. On the one hand you'd say &quot;FFS&quot;, on the other if they get that for it then fair play to them maybe?</div>

				<div class="content">That's a lot of evaporation. Are you sure the capsule isn't damaged. <br /><br />This will affect the value greatly. <br /><br />I would recommend an auction site. Whiskyauctioneer.com are getting good prices at present. They charge 5% sellers commission which is reasonable. Sterling rate is great for sellers at the moment too.</div>
