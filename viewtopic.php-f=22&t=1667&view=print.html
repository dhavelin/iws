				<div class="content">I noticed Aldi are stocking Clontarf 1014 whiskey now. I'm sure it's the Castle Brands one that has been through a few iterations over the years but this one is &quot;bottled for Aldi&quot;. Triple-distilled, aged in bourbon, no age statement (the non-Aldi Clontarf 1014 is a 4 years old NAS).<br /><br />There was only one bottle of the Avoca 8yo left though still plenty of the Avoca NAS. I'm guessing this brand is on the way out given the appearance of Clontarf.<br /><br />I thought we might have seen the end of supermarket bottlings when Cooley exited the business but Aldi, at least, has found a way to continue.</div>

				<div class="content">I always wondered about Clontarf, who buys/drinks it etc as I very rarely hear people talking about it. However the other side of Clontarf is the constant rebranding. Of all modern Irish Whiskey brands this has got to be the most rebranded. <br /><br />I came across an even newer version of the 1014 weighted branding<br /><br />from this only last year I think<br /><br /><img src="http://www.mcleanscotland.com/includes/Clontarf%201014.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />to this<br /><br /><img src="https://d3qcduphvv2yxi.cloudfront.net/assets/4745190/view_large/AAClontarf1014_001.jpg?1323639299" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Not sure whether the second pic is a mock up but they definitely have added to the first incarnation.<br /><br />I like it though ...</div>

				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br /><br />   How ironic.  I was planning to post tonight about this very whiskey (Clontarf) of which I am enjoying a dram tonight as I type this whilst listening to Classic Jazz (Body and Soul) on my vintage mono Stephens Tru-Sonic Horn Speaker and Tube Amp.  OK, I'm a bit.....mellow.  Yes indeed, I have the same CLONTARF 1014 (as pictured above in the ad) which was recommended by a fellow Audiophile at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.audiokarma.org">www.audiokarma.org</a><!-- w --> in a thread at the forum's &quot;cooking and spirits&quot; page.  So, due to this recommendation, I picked up a bottle of Clontarf in New Hampshire for about twenty dollars (or less) a bottle.  Well gentleman, I must say, I REALLY like the taste of 1014 Whiskey.  Ooooh, not to be missed, my othere NEW favorite (budget) Irish Whiskey  is CONCANNON Irish Whiskey.  Do check out the story on Concannon at Youtube.  I think Concannon is an awesome Whiskey especially at it's budget price (at least in NH).  Oooh, I should buy a CASE of Concannon which (in the State of NH) is about $17.00 a bottle and that my friends is a HUGH bargain!  If there is a better Irish Whiskey at this price point, I'd like to know it's name.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

Great to hear you enjoy the Concannon also, unfortunately we will probably never see it over here and ye may never see it again either once the current stock runs out so get buying and keep for a rainy day. The Beam take over of Cooley has shut down a lot of these projects unless they have a contract in place. Enjoy and thanks for sharing.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />I'd love to try it as I wonder how the Shriaz matured element of the whiskey affects the taste ... must get me transatlantic spies on the case  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
