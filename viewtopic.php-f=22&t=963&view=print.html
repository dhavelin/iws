				<div class="content">To be called Maiden Voyage whiskey. It is matured in poitin barrels. Sound like they could be worn out barrels left on the island, but I don't know. Interesting anyway. It doesn't specify a distillery, but I think it must be Cooley. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><a href="https://www.inishturkbeg.com/produce/whiskey/" class="postlink">Inish Turk Beg Single Malt</a></span></div>

				<div class="content">Oh for the love of......<br /><br />This is just one of many many uninhabited or barely inhabited islands in clew bay. They've done everything to suggest, bas saying it outright, that the whiskey is made on the island. There is no distillery in clew bay (no legal one anyway).<br /><br />Honest to god, what are they on about - we bring it down from cask strength with rainwater???? So they take some Cooley Malt, add some water from a rain butt on the side of the house, then put it into some barrels that probably had Knockeen hills in the for about 3 days.<br /><br />And they say &quot;this is the first time this whiskey has been available off the island&quot;. I'd imagine it's the first time it's been available on the island too.<br /><br />Tomorrow I shall leave a bucket out in the rain. Once collected I shall water some 46% Redbreast down to 40%, and stick it in a miniature barrel for 24 hours.<br /><br />By Thursday my new exclusive Wicklow Town PPS will be available as a special offer to Society members as the fantastic discounted price of €250 a bottle.<br /><br />Please sign up here.<br /><br />Sorry for ranting but I really would like to see a real Irish Island whiskey. This isn't it.<br /><br />Now if the porterhouse built their distillery on Achill then that would be something.</div>

				<div class="content">If they are dipping a toe in the water for the making or maturation of whiskey then it's a very sensible way to start. And it has already drawn my attention to the island and its activities for the first time so it's good for visibility. Must be hard to make a go of a business on an island off the west coast.</div>

				<div class="content">Every one in the game of whiskey/whisky production and sales are vying for attention, and for a point of difference. They have started in the right way if this is to be achieved with a limited budget. It will be interesting to see how this pans out for them. With so few Irish whisky producers they stand a good chance with those consumers looking for something different.<br /> <br />How much is this going to cost? Those &quot;hand-blown glass mooring bottles&quot; suggests that it will be a small fortune, and that keeping costs down is not a primary concern for them.</div>

				<div class="content">Personally, I know too little about this product to consider spending €130+ on it. It seems like a marketing fad to me with all of the contact details only available from the UK. A handfull of sand brought over somewhere to make 'hand-blown' glass and rainwater used to water down the spirit from cask strength - I could be wrong but I think it's hard to prove the indiginous nature of rainwater? Anyway, I reckon this Emperor has no clothes. I'll leave it open for the Emperor to prove me wrong and name his tailor...... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />As a side bar, does anyone else think that heritage is being slowly and surgically removed from this industry?</div>

I don't really need a 100+ Euro invitation to Inish Turk  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />They are possibly 3 or 4 years too late on this ...<br /><br />Interesting that they are bottling this in a 1L bottle also.

				<div class="content">Interesting program/interview etc. with Nadim Sadek of InishTurk Beg on RTE's Countrywide radio programme this morning 26th March 2011.<br />You should be able to listen to the podcast version by Monday <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rte.ie/radio1/countrywide/">http://www.rte.ie/radio1/countrywide/</a><!-- m --><br />From memory ...3rd fill casks (empty (quote) &quot;knackered old casks&quot; are taken from Cooley and seasoned on the beach for a couple of years to absorbe the essence of the Island, filled with Poitin (presumably new spirit from Cooley) for a month or two .... then emptied and filled with 10yo malt.<br /><br />I may have got the order wrong, but the story is something along that line.<br />While the whiskey segment of the programme is only 2 or 3 minutes, the whole interview is well worth listening to.<br />The programme must have had some effect - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.inishturkbeg.com">http://www.inishturkbeg.com</a><!-- m --> is very slooooooooow.<br />In addition to the whiskey, they've started a fantastic music series - I wish Nadim and crew well on their efforts.<br />Michael</div>
