They have very very different styles, despite that fact that they both followed what you might call the same tradition. Sometimes prefering one to the other can be a matter of preferring style to say some notion of technical ability or &quot;soul&quot;. It's hard to judge a player in an objective way. For example, there are lots of fantastic singers out there. But if someone with an incredible voice only sings music of a style you don't like then you will not get any enjoyment from it.<br /><br />Peter Green's style is probably closer in some ways to the Robert Johnson &quot;template&quot; and some of the players like Buddy Guy. He's also a great accoustic player - he recorded an album of Robert Johnson songs a few years back. On the blues stuff with the original Fleetwood Mac he really gives and older style feel to some of the stuff, like &quot;Stop messing round&quot;.<br /><br />Clapton is a very different animal and suffers from the perception (and rightly so in my opinion) that a lot of the material he's done since the early 70's has been, to be frank, somewhat dull. Nevertheless, he was one of the great innovators in terms of the development of the electric guitar sound that evolved in the 60's. As an electirc blues player her takes some elements for Albert King. But at it's best his playing is utterly fantastic with an ability to hit the perfect note on the right occasion. My favourites would be White Room and the Stephen Stills track &quot;Think I'll go back home&quot;<br /><br />I think trying to compare guitarist can sometimes be like trying to compare an opera singer to a jazz singer. Another case in point would be John Martyn as mentioed by John M. There's another fantastic player with a completely different style. By the way, he was rated as the &quot;best&quot; by Clapton at one point. I spent years learning the stuff Clapton and Green did, but when I came across John Martyn, it was almost like learning the guitar over again. And I can also say that in most company playing &quot;May you never&quot; impresses people more than being able to reproduce the solo from &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;.<br /><br />Trad is another think entirely - for me that's like a different language - there's some fantastic guitar players out there who sound all the better to me because I haven't a clue what they're up to.<br /><br />Anyway, just reaslised I'm rambling. I'll stop now. <br /><br />By the way, just went back to an open Locke's 8yo after 3 years. I don't remember it being this good. I'd only taken about 2 measures before, but this is lovely!!</div>

				<div class="content">That's quality rambling - I enjoyed reading that. <br /><br />I only really like what Clapton did with Cream and the Blues Breakers. Not much of a fan of anything else. <br /><br />I also think Richard Tompson is a great guitarist. i prefer his guitar to his voice. And our own Rory Gallagher.<br /><br />And I always liked Friday Night in San Fransisco, even if it is a little show-offy on the part of the performers. Always liked John McLoughlan. I always thought all three of them (paco de lucia, al di meola) played on this tune, but I only see two in the video. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlaCZ106b5w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlaCZ106b5w</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">Richard Thompson! Another great example - I actualy thought about him halfway through the ramble, accidently deleted half of what I'd written then started over and forgot all about him. And as for Rory, that goes without saying, another unique voice.<br /><br />Actually I think that's the key to all the great guitarists - there's plenty of people who can recreate the sound of someone else but all the greats have that sometimes intangible voice all of their own.<br /><br />For example, out of all the widely reknowned guitar players Thin Lizzy had over the years, the only one I wanted to play like was Eric Bell.</div>

				<div class="content">So many familiar names from my past coming up here. I was greatly taken by the blues guitar as a young lad but I haven't listened to that genre in years. Does anybody remember Johnny Norris? He used to gig in Dublin and his acoustic blues playing blew me away.<br /><br />A lot of great finger-pickers come to mind but here's one:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX0eTp7SoNU" class="postlink">Tommy Emmanuel</a><br /><br />My first job was in a supermarket where the same damn tape played on a loop day in day out. There is only one of those tracks that I don't hate to this day.

Unlike the rest he decided to submit a list covring about 900 years. It wasn't published but it gave him the idea for a series of concerts covering music from the previous 800 years - not everything is to my taste but it's completely fascinating - it ranges from an 800 yr old song in old english to britney spears. <br /><br />Well worth a look.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Excellent stuff. Another talented person for me to be jealous of...<br /><br />I have not heard of that, but I did see a clip of Thompson playing Oops I did it again, so I presume that's from this series of concerts.</div>

I like Classical Gas - had never heard of this guitarist, though. <br /><br />Isn't Classical Gas on some ad at the moment.</div>
