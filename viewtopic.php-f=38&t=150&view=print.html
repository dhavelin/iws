				<div class="content">Yes the Waterford Limerick game was definitely a game of 2 halves. Looked like Waterford would run away with it in the first half but they were lucky ,due to Limericks wasteful use of the ball, not to lose in the end.<br /><br />Yes we'll see how Joe Canning deals with a serious team</div>

				<div class="content">Clearly the rumours of Mr. Canning's demise were greatly exaggerated! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />What a fantastic game, it's what hurling is all about, edge of the seat stuff. I was a bit iffy about Galway's entry into the Leinster frame at the start but to be honest a competitive game like that hasn't been played at the semi-final stage for a long time. On to meet the new kids on the hurling block (Dublin!) next; hopefully we can look forward to more of the same!<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">A good run out for Galway so it should stand them well through the back door stages. Both counties need thsee type of games as in all fairness Kilkenny only rarely get it put up to them in Leinster  unless Wexford are strong and Galway have no one to play against in Connacht.<br /><br />Waterford Limerick was a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />I am sceptical at how Dublin will fair against Kilkenny but you never know. IF they can keep it respectable that may be as good as they can hope.</div>

				<div class="content">Did anyone see the All Ireland Final yesterday? In my opinion it has to rank as one of the finest finals in many years. Two great teams producing a fantastic display which had supporters and 'neutrals' on the edge of their seats for 72 minutes!!</div>

				<div class="content">Yes a fantastic game and the Minor match was a cracker too.<br /><br />I think Kilkenny deserved it in the end but you'd have to feel sorry for Tip especially in relation to the penalty which was very harsh. Second Goal was a lovely piece of play which I think knocked the stuffing out of poor Tip.<br /><br />Great spectacle though ... good skill and hard tackling a great advocate for the game.</div>
