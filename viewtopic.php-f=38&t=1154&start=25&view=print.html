				<div class="content">Ah yes, I expect you are right about diluting. I overlooked that.<br /><br />It can't hurt to adjust the water before distillation so maybe it's safest to do that anyway. Next time I'm talking to a distiller, I'll see if I can get the water profile for you.</div>

				<div class="content">That would be a great thing Dave. Thanks soo much for all the  feedback too<br /><br /><br />Same thanks to others who posted.  Now i have to find out  more about poteen for  now. I remember reading about it somewhere. Perhaps it was in  1000 years of Irish whiskey.<br />We are working on a  label for the poteen.<br /><br /> I guess we need to know if the word hillbilly is used In ireland and what the steryotype image is. We have our  moonshoner  types here.<br /><br /><img src="http://comps.fotosearch.com/comp/DNV/DNV126/people-drinking-moonshine_~00164AGL.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://comps.fotosearch.com/comp/WP/NSP295/moonshiners_~WPN045.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://comps.fotosearch.com/comp/DNV/DNV126/mountain-men-posing_~00152AGL.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Poteen recipes vary wildly ... you can make it like the way you are making your whiskey and use grain (anyway grain will do but always a bit of malted is used to get the mash fermenting) or you could use potatoes skins which was another traditional way of making Irish Poteen. <br /><br />I also spotted this recipe <br /><br />7 lb of bakers yeast<br />3 stone of brown sugar<br />4 lb of treacle<br />1 lb of hops<br /><br />1. Steep ingredients in 3 gallons of lukewarm water at the bottom of a 40 gallon barrel after steeping fill barrel to three quarter full with cold spring water. Leave in a cool place to settle. After several weeks transfer to your still<br /><br /><br />The other basic difference between poteen and whiksey is that it is not matured ... some people think is was matured but I think not. True poteen has been kept in oak casks allright but it was more of a means of storing rather than maturing. Poteen is nearly always a clear newly made spirit. Lethal stuff if it is &quot;still&quot; strength and you skull it back.<br /><br />Trivia<br /><br />Poteen or poitín or potcheen literally means little pot. Basically the term grew from the apparatus that was used which was a mini potstill.<br /><br />Size and shape and crudeness varied hugely also.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ancientsites.com/aw/Article/785672" class="postlink">Handy Article to read here</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.finnvalley.ie/glenfin/liammcmenamin/poitin.html" class="postlink">and also here</a><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.finnvalley.ie/glenfin/liammcmenamin/images/gardai.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Typical Poitín making equipment</div>

It varies as to whether these terms mean people from outside dublin or more particularly people from more remote areas outside towns.<br /><br />People from Cork city consider themselves neither culchies or jackeens, rather an entirely seperate and vastly superior category.</div>

But you do often hear people say he's from the mountains and it is an explain all expression. You very rarely hear Culchie mentioned outside of Dublin these days even though there is now a <a href="http://www.culchiefestival.com/" class="postlink">festival dedicated to it</a>.<br /><br />&quot;Bogger&quot; is possibly a more widely used term by &quot;townies&quot; in general relation to people from the &quot;sticks&quot;.<br /><br />You could possibly call it &quot;bog water&quot; even though that has another connotation also but we won't go there.</div>
