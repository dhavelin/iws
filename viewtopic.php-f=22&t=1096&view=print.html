				<div class="content">Wow, great news. Looking forward to the day of the publication. Some great ideas of new SPS bottling`s.<br />I really like the Idea about the Green Spot range (Blue,Yellow,Red and Green).<br />Other possible new bottling`s: Jameson 12Y.O. SPS/Jameson 18Y.O. SPS/Redbreast 18Y.O. SPS<br />My favorite would be another ore more Midleton Single Cask bottling(`s).What about a sherry or oak cask?</div>

I am really looking forward to tasting this.<br /><br />No idea what to expect from the Barry Crockett Legacy but I presume it will be another fine release from IDL.<br /><br />Slightly disappointed though that this was leaked as I was building up to the day of release ... ahh well these things can'r be helped ... but maybe we can contain it so ssssshhhh every one  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">Actually my comment was slightly misleading as I'm not sure if there is a line with a blend and single malt of the same age statement. But they certainly would have the likes of a 10yo  cask strength and also a lower strength version. So not the same as what you were saying. <br /><br />Still as long as there is a clear difference on the labels it should not pose a problem. But as you say still a bit of mystery there to keep us interested and of course we have not seen the Powers design or the &quot;M&quot; in the flesh which is worthy of anticipation build up in itself  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I actually think I had a taste of one of these the last time I was in Midleton. Billy Leighton gave me a taste of a mystery whiskey which he would not reveal what it was ... I guessed it was a Powers 18yo but thinking back now why would it not be a SPS Powers I was tasting  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Hope so as it was really nice.</div>
