				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />I've had the very first Writers Tears Cask Strength 2011 with the scroll and discontinued glasses since it came out but struggle to find anything online regarding a price.<br />It hasn't appeared on any of the many auction sites in Scotland, and I've searched! No site has it. I've heard completely different opinions on the scale in terms of a selling price. Even one that sold for a large amount privately.<br /><br />Could anyone shed more light on this bottle? I'm just surprised it's that hard to find, unless I'm missing something.<br /><br />Ben</div>

				<div class="content">I'm lucky to have them. <br />There was <br />1200 in 2011.<br />1800 in 2012<br />2500 in 2013<br />1980 in 2014 <br />2100 in 2015<br />&amp; 2640 in 2016. <br /><br />Most are 53% apart from the 2012. I think it originally retailed for €120 or something like that. As IWC says I'm not sure about the collectibility of it but if it is than the 2011 is the one to get.</div>
