				<div class="content">Never finished the last one properly<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Underdogs</span> Some Irish whiskies that we don't usually think about but are available, could chose from any of the following ... Avoca, Brogan's Legacy, Coleraine Blend, Dany Boy, Dunphy's, Feckin Irish, Henry Downes No 9, Merry Single Malt, Millers, Murphys and others that I'm maybe missing. Probably would need to throw in an expensive whiskey to end as these are all cheap and cheerfull but we should not be afraid to try stuff that we may not necessairly give a second thought to.<br /><br />And springing from the above ....<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Supermarket savers</span> Get a selection of supermarket Irish Whiskeys and do a head to head with them again finish with a great whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">One thing that occurred to me before, and again last night when in communication with David, is that perhaps we could consider expanding our remit re tastings beyond the single big monthly meeting.<br /><br />There have been good suggestions made before for tastings that would be of great interest to some members, but probably not the majority or the visiting public. Some of the proposed tastings like the Jameson 12 yo range, supermarket whiskeys, and unusual Scotches might fall into this category.<br /><br />But just because they mightn't be oversubscribed tastings doesn't mean they wouldn't be interesting ones. It might be worth exploring the possibility of a second, smaller venue to be sporadically used for such smaller tastings, in addition to the regular monthly tastings. <br /><br />This adds value for the membership, expands our repertoire of offerings, and we could also use such smaller gatherings to assess the potential of doing such a tasting for a wider audience at the monthly meeting down the line.<br /><br />For a general whiskey drinking audience, a close comparative tasting of Jameson 12 yo whiskeys might be too narrow, but for a niche audience it would be fascinating. For a general audience, tasting supermarket blends might not seem appealing. But to a niche audience, it could be enlightening.<br /><br />Just an idea.</div>

				<div class="content">Following up my post on the rye tasting thread, we could consider a &quot;triple pot still&quot; tasting with Woodford Reserve (Bourbon), Green Spot or Redbreast (Irish) and Auchentoshan (Scotch).  There are a couple of other triples in Scotland, including some Springbanks.  If we don't have six we could always split it with a &quot;double distillation&quot; comparison.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>rathbeggan wrote:</cite>There are a couple of other triples in Scotland, including some Springbanks.</div></blockquote><br />Hazelburn is the name of the triple distilled spirit from Springbank.  Currently there are the CV, 8yo and 12yo OB variants generally available with some other IBs from Cadenhead.  Other scottish distilleries that may fit the bill are Mortlach and Benrinnes as they practice a (complicated) type of triple distillation.</div>
