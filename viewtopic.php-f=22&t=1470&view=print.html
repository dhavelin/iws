Apart from the proposed &quot;Spot&quot; expansion what would your wish list be?<br /><br />Here's a few thing I'd love to see:<br /><br />On the SPS front:<br /><br />Cask strength Redbreast 15<br />Redbreast 21<br />Maybe a Powers John's lane 18<br />A single sherry cask SPS<br /><br />On the blends I'd love to see an 18yo Powers. And another single cask blend like the Celtic whiskey shop had a few years back.</div>

If it was a 12 yr old you could end up with five 12yo SPS from the same distillery if they also do a yellow spot. There comes a point when you're just doing variations for variations sake.Think of SPS from Midleton as equivalent to single malt - would you expect 5 different 12yr olds from one distillery?

I was wondering if they did introduce a Jameson SPS, would they perhaps drop one of the others. They wouldn't lose the NAS, obviously. I don't want them to drop the Gold, and the 18yo is pretty classy. I could live without the RVR but they would only replace that with something else I couldn't afford. So that leaves the Jameson 12yo for the chop. Which is OK by me, but then everything is 12 years old, like you say.<br /><br />I'm sure they could make them all taste different, with their different SPS formulae and casks. But they will also have a whole new distillery line coming on stream soon with which they can experiment.</div>

				<div class="content">last year when we were at Bow street for the launch of Redbreast 12 cask strength, i was so disappointed.<br /><br />we had the Green Spot, RB12, RB15, Powers 12 SPS, and we were asked what we think is missing from that  line.<br /><br />well,a blind can see a Jameson SPS is missing from that line, if we are talking whiskeys from IDL, and various brands, so there was really Jameson missing<br /><br />so that day I was expecting a new Jameson 15 Years old SPS and not the cask strength RB12<br /><br />I have said that to Liam after the tasting, <br /><br />I hope Jameson 15 SPS will be on the market soon<br /><br />the reason why in my view is, there is a good few 12 years old available, and a 15 year old will fit in the line perfectly <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />my second thing i would like from IDL, since they have over 900000 casks maturing, and surely some 20+ years old, and very good profit every year, they should donate a 20 yo, bourbon single cask (free of charge of course) for the good standing society members, which surely not gonna broke IDL<br /><br /><br />the third and final wish, a 15 years old single bourbon cask SPS, bottled for myself, at cask strength, and i will pay for it @ €40/L  pure alcohol +relevant taxes vat etc<br /><br />so IDL, please ask for my mobile from your colleagues (a few have it), or just pm me to finalise the deal<br /><br />thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Well I think to have IDL giving us our own cask would be what everyone would have on their wish list but I was thinking more of commercial releases rather that stuff I'd like if there were no restrictions. Again I'm not that hung up on the brand names they use for SPS as I think of them all as Midleton anyway. Maybe another 15yo at Cask Strangth would be a good fit for the Jameson name, especially as there is no 15yo in the Jameson range.<br /><br />And I agree a 20+ SPS at a reasonable price would be good too - but I was thinking a Redbreast type bourbon/sherry mix rather than bourbon only type which I'm not sure would be that different from the 19yo single casks or the Midleton Barry Crockett.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>DavidH wrote:</cite>They have been maturing stuff in port and madeira casks. </div></blockquote><br /><br />Now that I think of it I did try a sample of Madeira matured SPS and I think that would make an excellent single cask release! I'd say you're more likely to see that under the Midleton name if that ever appears.<br /><br />I think if you look at the labelling there's a clear intention to keep Jameson as a brand and blend distinct from Midleton as a single pot still distillery, equivalent to a single malt. If you look at the SPS bottlings they all clearly say Midleton whereas they used to have all sorts of Dublin addresses on them.<br /><br />In the past IDL had a 2 Brand focus with Jameson up front and Bushmills as number 2. I think they're going the same way but with Midleton / SPS as the second front.</div>

Maybe a 10yo Paddy. I'd buy that. Poor auld paddy is very neglected.</div>

				<div class="content">Interesting. Still though it's definitely not ten years old now so you're right - it would be good to make it so. <br /><br />The other thing I'd love to see from Midleton is a single grain. It seems to me you can get almost every other type of whiskey made in Ireland on it's own - Malt from Bushmills, Cooley and Kilbeggan, Grain from Cooley, Pot Still from Midleton but no Midleton Grain, which let's face it, is probably the type that is consumed most by volume when you count that sales of Jameson, Tullamore Dew and Bushmills blends.<br /><br />Oh and maybe some Midleton Malt for completeness.</div>

				<div class="content">That's good to know. I was at a tasting given by Barry Walsh a number of years ago. He was talking about Crested 10 and said they couldn't call it a 10 yr old, but the name pointed to the fact that there were older whiskies in the blend. Maybe he was speculating. Or maybe I'm misremembering. Someone suggested they call the Jameson Gold, I think, be called Crested 20...</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with Iain about the names--- if brands coded more clearly for cuts or barrels or something more substantial, i might get more excited about the prospect of such and such a name getting an sps release. I'm actually glad they dont though as i think the versatility of mixing across styles and barrels etc is Midleton's greatest strength as a distillery and there'd be no sense trading that in for something more arbitrary. personally, i'd like to see port and madeira cask sps whiskeys released on their own, or at least as finishes on, say, a bourbon barrel. (this returns to Iain's other point in another thread about the need for other dimensions to spice up a bourbon barrel sps.) I would, however, lay a bet that it can only be a metter of time before they release an SPS under the jameson label. Its the smart move in terms of marketing. They're pushing SPS as a connoisseur's choice for irish whiskey in general and its only a matter of time before they trade in on the brand cache of Jameson. If anything, this would expose jemmie drinkers to the concept, from which they might go on to explore other options. I could be wrong, but it makes a lot of sense to me.</div>

It was nothing to set the world alight but it was only a 6yr old and wasn't, I think, an official bottling. It might be interesting to try at 10 yrs old, maybe compared to a Bushmills of the same age.<br /><br />The discussion is expanding my wish list, if nothing else. <br /><br />On the SPS I started with Redbreast 15 CS, Redbreast 21, Power JL18 and a single sherry cask.
