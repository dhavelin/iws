				<div class="content">I just checked the latest results on whiskyauctions.com and it looks like your bottle may have appreciated over the last few days<br />there were 3 bottles available none were Pot still or the 7year olds. <br />The John's lane made €68, it had a very high fill level for its age too but condition was good. <br />There were 2 Smithfield bottles, €32 for one  &amp; €53 for the one with a box,again they were in good condition.<br />I checked previous results and back in 2008 they were making €15 for the John's Lane (condition not good) and €18 for a Smithfield bottle. <br /> <br />That would put your bottle worth €60 min excluding transport and commission. basically doubling market value for a new bottle.<br />great to see the recession is over <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">If a non age stated version possibly around the €150 mark. But you can get them for cheaper on Ebay if your lucky enough to spot one that does not have too much interest.</div>

				<div class="content">Personally I do not take much notice whether it says John's Lane or Smithfield on the bottle as I view this as<br />an office address for business reasons. Rather the description as being Power's Irish Whiskey or Power's Dublin Whiskey<br />which both Power's and Jameson Red Seal used to state on their labels. If they state 'Irish Whiskey' then to me they<br />are products of the Midleton Distillery and therefore could not be described as Dublin whiskey anymore. Maybe some ex<br />Irish Distillers staff could indicate if this is so. <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /></div>
