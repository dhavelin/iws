				<div class="content">What i can tell you is the Hewitt's brand was introduced in 1964, as a lightly peated blended irish whiskey to compete domestically with scotch. It was later reformulated without the peat and was discontinued in the late 90s/early 00s afaik.<br /><br />So if your bottle is the older label it is probably late 1960s or 70s.</div>

				<div class="content">I have some of the peated Hewitt's ( round bottle mid 1960's) --- Came from 'The old Lyric Bar', 42 Catherine St., Limerick bar <br />that closed in 1968. Have over the years swapped a few of them and would still swap another three for bottles of the same vintage <br />( cork/Midleton  items preferably.) (Pm me if anyone interested) I had 10 one time but between swaps, Millenium celebrations and <br />other significant events a number of them were lost in action <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>
