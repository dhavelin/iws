				<div class="content">Hi there birdman,<br /><br />Slight correction the L4 relates to 2014, this format was introduced as late as 2006.<br />That means you might find 2014 batches on the shelves of your local store.<br /><br />Cheers TWB</div>

				<div class="content">Amazingly my bottle was filled the same day but a little later on. <br /><br />The code is L4 218 ? 145. The ? is slightly damaged and isn't clearly visible. I expected it to be 3 but I've a 2005 bottle which is L5 326 5 288. I'm guessing the 1,2,3 were added after. <br />I've an 2011 and it's L1 234 3 1278 (time)<br />It has 22/08/11 under it. <br /><br />As you can see the earlier codes have 8 digits while the later has 9. <br /><br />It's a 2004 bottle. My 2004 and 2005 came with plinths. <br /><br />The Redbreasts of the same era were also House Of Donohue and the 5th (of 8 too)digit of the code is also 3. <br /><br />I wonder was the Jameson 12 different</div>
