				<div class="content">Possibly, the maxim &quot;If it looks too good to be true, it is too good to be true&quot; applies here but ...<br />Douglas Laing/ Douglas McGibbon's Provenance &quot;Port Ellen&quot; 26yo (700ml) @ 46% from Spring 1983 was £99 at Heathrow on Sunday last, but only £48 in Gatwick this morning.  I did ask if there was a pricing error, but ... no.<br /><br />OK<br />Couldn't wait! - The official notes from Douglas Laing follow:<br />&quot;PRV 0599  Port Ellen   26 Year Old Sherry Matured <br />The nose opens with leather, runs to caramelised peanuts on a coal fire and develops <br />to a burnt chestnut quality. The palate opens with a spicy sweet sherry influence <br />from the cask but quickly transforms to rich warming peat smoke. The finish is long, <br />still spicy and carries to sweet tar and bonfire ashes. &quot;<br /><br />I find that the initial nose promises great things - but the peat on the nose dissipates quickly.  The taste is a bit jarring - like the whiskey hasn't married into a single smooth taste.  Slightly bitter and very long after-taste.</div>

Even £99 for a PE is on the lower side for this distillery which has become a bit of a cult classic so half that price is very unusual.<br /><br />A pity really but at that price you had to go for it and not a majorly expensive mistake. You'd never know it may improve a bit after a few weeks open but probability is that it is never going to be a classic.<br /><br />I still have one of the excellent Bladnoch bottled PE's which I'll share a large one with you one day if your even in the area   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />By the way I love your new Avatar  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>

				<div class="content">Don't get me wrong.  Its still a bargain ... and the finish goes on and on ... maybe up to 20 minutes, similar to an Ardbeg Supernova.  That's not to be sniffed at.  Its well worth the £98 or indeed £48. <br />Michael</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />    SixCats! (aka Tom Patrick) here in Maine, USA.  Maine is the largest of the six New England States and the most Northern of the N.E. States.  Bordering Maine (on the South) is the State of New Hampshire <br />(North of Maine is Canada).  New Hampshire has much larger (State owned) Liquor Stores with a greater selection of Liquors.  Prices in NH are (I believe) the least expensive in New England. There is NO State tax in NH.  I recently made two trips to NH and purchase several items to start my &quot;newbie&quot; collection of Spirits.  Being a &quot;bargain hunter&quot;, I always look to buy sale items first.  I am &quot;Squirreling away&quot; for next Fall &amp; Winter.  Winters are looong and cold here in the Great White North of Maine.  Remember the &quot;Boy Scout&quot; motto &quot;always be prepared&quot;.  At any rate, in two trips, I bought the following : two REDBREAST, one &quot;The Irishman Original Clan&quot;, one Jameson 12, one ARDBEG 10, one Highland Park 12, one TAMDHU 10, and one BLACK BUSH.  The most expensive items were the REDBREAST which cost $43.00 a 750ml each.  The HP 12 and the Ardbeg 10 were $42.00 each.  The Jameson 12 is a BARGAIN in NH at $34.00 (compared to Maine's price of $44.00).  Black Bush is $31.00 a bottle.  IMHO, <br />TAMDHU 10 at $22.00 a bottle is a great deal!  Powers Gold label is $20 in NH and $22 in Maine.  I had already purchase Powers (in Maine) and have already emptied my first bottle.   Bushmills Original (White label) is $19.00 in NH.  I plan on drinking a lot of Bushmills Original at this price.  I've only had a NIP of Bushmills Original and I rather enjoyed the dram.  I've already opened the BLACK BUSH and the TAMDHU 10.  Oooh, I almost forgot, I also bought<br />(in Maine) &quot;The famous Grouse Gold Reserve&quot; ($32.00) which I've nearly finished as well.  Man, I've spent a lot of money recently!  Me wife is gonna kill me! <br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>
