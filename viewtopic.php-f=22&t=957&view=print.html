				<div class="content">I a member of a recently estalished whiskey appreciation society in the north of Nottinghamshire, England. Before ideas start of me stealing information and setting up a rival society, thats not the case. It's simply half a dozen good friends all 50+ finding an excuse to get out the house once a quarter and enjoy the old aqua vītae  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Several memebrs are familiar /very familiar with Scotch whisky but no-one has much experience or knowledge of Irish whiskey.  Our next meeting is early january and I have offered to find out about Irish whiskey to help educate us all.<br /><br />Basically i'm just after some pointers. I'm not wanting you guys to do the research for me as i'll enjoy that myself but i just want to make sure i'm reading from good sources and not finding out bogus facts.<br /><br />Some areas i'm hoping to find out are:<br /><br />how does it differ from Scotch whisky<br />is the manufacturing/distilling process significantly different<br />what are the most common brands<br />are there any good sources of printed information/literature<br /><br />I've been looking at the jameson website and using wikipedia for a bit of info on distilleries but thats it so far. I'm actually fairly new to computers so getting this far has taken its time!<br /><br />Any information, books, websites, or anything else which may help to make our next meeting a raring success would be <span style="font-style: italic">greatly</span> appreciated.<br /><br />many thanks</div>

Peter Mulryan's The Whiskeys of Ireland is a more up-to-date source. <br /><br />Good luck. Would love to hear how your tasting goes.</div>

				<div class="content">Most people here will be glad to answer any of your questions and give advice freely. But you know what they say about free advice, and that includes mine  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> . The best part of it is the tasting research ... but I'll stick my oar in anyway.<br /><br />Bushmills produce only Single Malt and Triple Distill. They Currently source their grain from Midleton but cask and age it themselves.<br /><br />Bottles to check out: Blackbush, 16yo triple wood, 21yo and any single cask bottling if you can get one.<br /><br /><br />Cooley produce Single Malt and Grain and only Double distill. They also are the only distillery in Ireland that produce peated and unpeated whiskey. Cooley produce many Brands,<br /><br />Ones to check out: Connemara Cask Strength, Greenore 15yo Grain, Locke's 8yo (Lightly Peated) Tyrconnell 10yo Maderia Finish <br /><br />and getting a lot of notice currently is Sainsbury's Irish Whiskey Dún Léire 8yo<br /><br />Kilbeggan is an old Distillery owned by Cooley. It closed in 1957 but started to distill in a small scale in 2007. The currently a double distilled Malt but possibly will triple distill too.<br /><br />Only one bottling available and that is only at the Distillery so possibly hard to get your hands on. Kilbeggan Distillery Malt.<br /><br />Midleton produce Pot Still, grain and small amounts of single malt (which is only used for blending) All is triple distilled. They are the biggest Distiller in Irisland by a long shot and dwarf all Scotch distilleries too bar a handful. They produce Pot Still or Pure Pot Still (PPS) whiskey which is a single distilled whiskey but because the worth is made up of both malted and unmalted barley it cant be considered as single malt but it is possibly Irelands best whiskey.<br /><br />Ones to check out: Greenspot, Redbreast 12 &amp; 15yo (All PPS) Powers Gold label, Jameson 12yo, Jameson Gold, Powers 12yo, Jameson 18yo</div>

				<div class="content">I'll second the recommendation for Jim Murray's &quot;Classic Irish Whiskey&quot;.  You'll probably have to buy a used copy as it was originally published in 1996-7 and is probably no longer in print.  It's dated but the additional material concerning now-dead brands is valuable.  <br /><br />Peter Mulryan's book, while not as comprehensive, features some stellar photography.  I'd buy that book for the photography alone.</div>
