				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />With lots of interest I was reading parts of your websites and noticed that some of you have excellent knowledge of the pubs in dublin. Perhaps I overlooked it already, but if possible I would like to make a kind of voucher to give to my boyfriend for his birthday in exchange of a few drinks or a tasting in Dublin. For example I would like to say 'valid for a glas of .... in bar .... ' . The only problem is that he knows a lot about whiskeys and I nothing..  <br /><br />Although as far as I know he is not very familiair with the Irish Whiskeys and much more with the ones from Scotland. Therefore I thought i could use that and read up about it so i could surprise him. <br /><br />Does any of you have experience with the tasting trays of the vathouse? Or would you say that it's a bit too touristic? Yes, i know i will be a tourist myself but i would hate to hear my own language around me and was thinking i should avoid a bit of the temple bar area? But perhaps i'm mistaken<br /><br />Would it be possible to suggest me a few good bars and a couple of Irish Whiskeys that are hard to find on the mainland of europe?<br />I read this one coming back as a recommandation for foreigners<br />- Connemara Turf Mor<br />Powers John's Lane SPS <br /><br />And as good bars<br /><ul>Brooks hotel bar<br />The Bull and Castle Christchurch Dublin 2<br />The Palace Bar Fleet street Dublin<br />Ryan's  Parkgate Street Dublin 8<br />Cusacks North Strand Road</ul><br /><br />If you could perhaps give me a few more whiskeys names he should try? That would help me make a really good birthday present! <br /><br />Thanks a lot in advance!</div>

				<div class="content">A glass of The Palace Bar whiskey in The Palace Bar! Great whiskey (not too expensive either), great pub, very central. And after that, try the Powers John's Lane whiskey and any others that take your fancy. They have a good selection.</div>

				<div class="content">I wouldn't rule out the tasting trays at the Vat House. They have put allot into it. They had different ones than the web page when I was there a few years back I think.The Irish tasting tray offers better variety and value than the Bushmill's one. I'll be trying the International one the next time I'm there.  It seems good value too but they wont be full measures at that price. Don't forget to tell the bar man to wet his fingers when he pours them <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> .<br /><br />If he's fond of Scottish single Malts, I nearly avoid the Turf MÃ³r as he'll be comparing to the Islay Malts.<br />The Power's John's Lane is outstanding.<br />I just after finishing off a bottle of Yellow Spot and it too was beautiful too but hard to find.<br />Tyrconnell is a lovely malt.<br />Crested 10 or Black Bush are great value blends, you would not find a better Scottish blend for the same money in my opinion but I a little bias. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />I'm not familiar with Dublin pubs but would recommend Kavanagh's on Dorset street and Mulligans in Stoneybatter, I think the address's are right. Great variety of beers too.</div>

				<div class="content">thanks so much for a response! I've already started making him curious about his birthday present.. <br /><br />And for the Turf Mor, is that than best to avoid? Or would a comparison also be a good thing? <br /><br />I will include a tasting at the VAT house then, i think it's a good opportunity for him to taste a few different things. Perhaps we could even start there..  Hm, it's gonna be a good tasting trip!</div>

				<div class="content">How long will ye be in Dublin? <br /><br />If you want to do these over a night or 2 then ...<br /><br />Brooks <br />Bull and Castle <br />And The Palace bar <br />are all with in walking distance as well as The Vat house.<br />Also in that area are Bow St bar and The Temple bar.<br />All are in or close to the templebar area.<br /><br />The Vat house is seen as expensive so will not have the crowds the others will.<br /><br />The Palace bar &amp; Bow st bar are both well worth a visit just to see traditional Dublin pubs.<br /><br />Brooks is a small hotel bar so does not have the same atmospheres as other Irish pubs but you probably can relax there out of the sometimes busy pub scene in Dublin.<br /><br />The Temple bar is quite touristy but has a large selection of whiskey so possibly worth a visit.<br /><br />The Bull &amp; Castle has a great beer selection and is a gastro pub.<br /><br />I think I would be with you on the Turf Mor as it may well be a good comparison. Or just try the Connemara  Cask Strength.<br /><br />What you could possibly do is google all the pubs as a lot will have websites. And pick what you fancy. Then do up your own little vouchers on the pc and say something like. This voucher entitles you to x whiskies in this pub/establishment. Great ideal and with a general voucher he can pick his own. Like a child in a sweet shop  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> . Possibly insist on a few Irish though  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br /><br />When in Rome as they say<br /><br />We can point you in the direction of some fact sheets for certain Irish whiskies later.</div>

				<div class="content">Well the When in Rome do as the Romans do, is exactly where i got this idea from. When we were in Rome he got a fine dinner in a restaurant with good wines, but when going to Ireland, I think i can make him happier with whiskey and a simple lunch/dinner somewhere. <br /><br />And we will be there for 4 days, thursday to sunday but only at the beginning of november but you can never be to early to prepare holiday plans <br /><br />Will do the googling the bars tomorrow and prepare the voucher combinations and post them here and also give feedback afterwards. But i'm really glad for your help, cities become so much better when you get some inside information and make it easier to navigate through a city.</div>

However all the ones mentioned are there so it gives you an idea of where every thing is.<br /><br />Just zoom into Dublin.

				<div class="content">Well if it does not there will be a que here a kilometer long to take his place. Looks great to me ....<br /><br />If you want to have a bit of fun you can incorporate the old token system where workers like cart delivery drivers got whiskey tokens which they could only cash or redeem for drink after a certain time to prevent them from drinking during work. Also in the states during prohibition you could only get whiskey on prescription. Google both and you may find examples to incorporate pictures of these in your own token system if desired.<br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Form-1928-Prescription-Form-for-Medicinal-Liquor-Prohibition-/190709086651?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2c6725b9bb#ht_1802wt_966">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Form-1928-Pre ... 1802wt_966</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br />But they are great as they are ...

I told him he could do the reporting afterwards, so most likely you will find another post here in a while. Thanks again!</div>
