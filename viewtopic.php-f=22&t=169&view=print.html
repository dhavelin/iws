				<div class="date"><img src="styles/iws/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Tue Jul 07, 2009 10:37 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I was watching <span style="font-style: italic">Bargain Hunt</span> today (it's very educational  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) and there was a very ornate &quot;Indian silver&quot; double spirit measure. By which I mean it had a single measure at one end and, if you turned it over, it had a double measure at the other end. A nice thing.<br /><br />Anyway, the antiques expert called the measure a &quot;chota peg&quot;, which was the terminology of the Raj. I've looked this up and it means &quot;small drink&quot; in Hindi. The opposite is a &quot;burra peg&quot; or &quot;big drink&quot;, an example of which might be a G&amp;T.<br /><br />The word &quot;peg&quot; is in my dictionary as a measure of spirits. Not sure if it derives from the above or if it's coincidence. Here's a quote from <span style="font-style: italic">Lord Jim</span>, by Joseph Conrad:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I've never been the worse for liquor in my life; the stuff ain't made yet that would make me drunk. I could drink fire against your whiskey peg for peg, b'gosh, and keep as cool as a cucumber.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Since the Scots seem to own the word &quot;dram&quot; for a shot of whiskey, and since they don't need any more advertising from us, I'm proposing we revive the word &quot;peg&quot;. There is something Irish-sounding about it anyway and it comes across less Bertie Woosterish than &quot;tot&quot;.<br /><br />Right, I'm off for a peg of Black Bush. Yup, rolls off the tongue, it does.</div>

				<div class="content">I like the word dram but would ever only use it in the written context. Could not see myself asking a bar man for a Dram of Jameson or a dram of lagavulin. Just the simple name and expression is enough to be blurting out in public.<br /><br />In all fairness I reckon this is more a written expression anyway. I've never heard of anybody ever ordering a dram even in Scotland, nor whisk(e)y for that matter which seems to be a term more used in Films ... I can see it now, John Wayne walks into the bar and looks at the bar tender and simply says 'Whiskey' . I would imagine Dram is only used by old men who drink the same brand day in day out in their local. Just like going down to your own local and asking for a Pint and the bar man knows what you want. <br /><br />So are we going to start pegging whiskey around the place  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">That would corroborate the glass theory being a double.<br /><br />By the way Powers is accredited to inventing the worlds first miniature.<br /><br />The Baby power was the very first miniature and was designed for the lady of the house, believe it or not, to tuck away under her shawl from the 'hatch' or pub back door or what ever and take home unnoticed so she could have her nip too. Women in pubs is only a relatively new thing and was frowned upon back in the day. Or hubby would take her home one after he got sozzeled in the pub to ease his conscience  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> .<br /><br />I'm not sure if the measures changed as such but possibly halved to give people the option of having a small one instead of having to have a glass. It was basically giving the drinker more options or maybe government interference, depending which way you looked at it. There could of been various factors to influence this too. The Temperance movement was very much active in Ireland as in the states as alcohol abuse etc was wide spread. Lessened work output or absenteeism from work due to alcohol related symptoms. Men folk abandoning their women folk for the pub and spending too much on drink while the family suffered. The social consequences were fairly obvious to see and I suppose the government had to be seen to do some thing therefore bringing in fixed measures for pubs to serve.<br /><br />This is all hypothesis of course but the government regulated fixed measure had to come in at some stage so it would be interesting if any knows when?<br /><br />35.5ml exactly equates to a quarter gill or modern day single measure and 71ml is half a gill now known as a double, a large one or previously a glass.<br /><br />A very interesting subject and could do with a definitive answer.

				<div class="content">Great thread.<br /><br />I have taken a few minutes out from writing my latest <span style="font-style: italic">Whiskey Bible </span>to give my tongue a chance to recover from yet another sulphured whisky. Not Irish, you'll be relieved to know.<br /><br />In 20 years of writing about Irish, I have always had a problem finding a term other than &quot;dram&quot;. I remember asking various blenders/distillery managers/sages over the years and they, too, had this exact problem. However, like me, they sometimes just referred to it as an &quot;Irish&quot;, as opposed to the more Scottish &quot;dram&quot;.<br /><br />As for a &quot;Peg&quot;: this was a term used for both Scotch and Irish. By the 1890s a special silver drinking vessel by this name was around. Before then, I understand, it was a a drinking vessel made often of wood. The inside of the vessel would have a loose peg to show the exact measure. There may have been holes above the first peg for it to be moved, so they could order &quot;two pegs of&quot; or &quot;three&quot;. Sometimes, the pegs were small and solid, like wooden warts, and you filled up to each mark. I have encountered antique dealers who claim to have had these from time to time, usually with the original pegs missing, but never been lucky enough to track one down for my own collection. For the record, the cover of my 1999 book <span style="font-style: italic">The Art of Whisky </span>actually shows a poster of an Irishman and Scotsman together drinking a Peg of Whisky.<br /><br />It may or may not be true regarding the Baby Power's being for ladies; certainly, that story has long done the rounds. However, John Power &amp; Son was ahead of its time from a marketing perspective in many ways. And they were not so daft as to not know the virtue of being able to sell its whiskey in smaller measures when times were tight and a family couldn't afford a full bottle. Which was most of the time for many families..<br /><br />Right. Back to the Bible. My tongue is, after several hours, restored and a Locke's Grand Crew 9-year-old Single Malt awaits....</div>
