				<div class="content">Yes it is a logical progression of the Spot range and expected. How they develop the range will be the interesting bit.<br /><br />As Green Spot is €45 currently I would reckon that the yellow spot will be over €60, if it is to be a 12yo.</div>

Behind him was dark green shading. From this image grew the name Green Spot. The popularity of this type of whiskey spread to a seven year old Blue Spot, a Yellow Spot (12) and Red Spot (15). <br /> <br /><br />When Jameson closed their Bow Street Distillery in the early 1970's, it was decided that Irish Distillers would produce, mature and bottle Green Spot whiskey for Mitchell's. The current Green Spot is made entirely from seven and eight year old Midleton pot still, a healthy 25% coming from sherry cask, which is quite evident in its aroma and taste.   It is still a pure pot still whiskey, one of only two brands regularly produced by the Midleton Distillery.&quot;</div>

Whiskey was sold much younger than we are used to. Obviously there was some older stuff on the go but in the majority <span style="font-weight: bold">Rare Old Irish</span> whiskey was never much older than 7years and the irish were very proud of selling such <span style="font-weight: bold">OLD</span> whiskey.. For a long time there was no legal age definition that whisk(e)y needed to be to be sold. The Scotts used to sell some of their mass produced grain when it had reached the ripe old age of 12 months. The Irish thought they were above all that and raised their minimum age to 5years for a good while but then the this was reduced to 3years where we are still.<br /><br />Very few whiskeys prior to 1900 were sold over 10years of age.</div>

I have, in the past, trawled through every old whiskey ad in the Irish Times archive and what I recall is 7yo and 10yo. I'm sure there was plenty of fire-water available but we are talking about quality whiskey here. When they had a bit of age on it, they advertised it, so they must have valued the mature whiskey as much as we do. So let me re-word what I said: it would have been young for a whiskey with an age statement, distilled by Jameson and matured by a quality wine importer like Mitchell's.</div>
