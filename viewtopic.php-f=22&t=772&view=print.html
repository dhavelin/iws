				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />    Long story short.  I have both Jameson 12 and Black Bush.  Being new to Whiskey drinking/tasting I have discovered that some evenings, I prefer Black Bush while other nights, I prefer Jameson 12.  IMHO, one dram is not better than the other, just...different and both excellent!  Here in Northern New England both Jameson 12 and Black Bush can be purchased (on sale in NH) $30.99 a 750ml bottle.  These two drams have become my (go to) Irish Whiskey foundation.  However, money being tight (and since my drams have grown from one ounce to three) I now also buy POWER Gold Label which is much less expensive.  I enjoy the POWER but, when I can afford to buy the Jameson 12 or Black Bush, I go the extra mile.  Oooh, I also still enjoy &quot;The Irishman&quot; Irish Whiskey as well  and look forward to the next sale.  I have been thinking I should try the standard Kilbeggan which is the least expensive Irish Whiskey available in Maine.  Kilbeggan has had some good reviews/press here in the U.S. but, I fear the reviews might by nothing but marketing hype.  Oooh well, I guess there is only one way to find out.  <br />It's a dangerous job but, somebody's got to do it!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">You should definately give Kilbeggan a go ... if it's not to your taste then you can always mix it with some Powers or even Blackbush to use it up and see how that grabs you. If you don't want to leave a bottle play around with it and mix with other whiskies. I find actually mixing cheap sweet irish with heavy peaty scotch malts interesting and fun. There are no rules so experiment any way you want.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi IWC,<br /><br />    Will do!  I can't pass up a chance to give Kilbeggan a try at Maine's price of $15.00 plus tax.<br />Much to my surprise, Kilbeggan is NOT available in NH.  Come to think of it, neither is PADDY or POWER 12.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi I-W,<br /><br />    It just so happens that I am having meself a dram of POWERS as I type this response.<br />I too very much enjoy POWERS.  That being said, I also enjoy Kilbeggan Irish Whiskey.  Heck, both POWERS and Kilbeggan are bargain priced favorites so I keep some of each brand handy.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>
