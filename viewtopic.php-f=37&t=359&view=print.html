				<div class="content">Hey, so i've never been able to make society events because i'm going to school out here in California and i was wondering if the society had any plans for an event or two during the summer? I know it's a long way off yet but i was just curious if you guys had any plans formulated</div>

				<div class="content">That would be pretty much any American whiskey apart from Jack and Jim!<br />Don't feel obliged to come laden, Fionnan. We'd be delighted to see you and any other guests at any of our tastings.<br />But at the same time, I've no doubt that members, if not the society itself, might be keen to send you a shopping list in advance of your trip!</div>
