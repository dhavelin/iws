				<div class="content">A bit of fun inspired by a comment from IWC:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>You have Jameson nas (a Hyundai Sonata) Jameson 12yo (VW Passat) Jameson Gold (Audi A4) and Jameson Rarest (Aston Martin DB9</div></blockquote><br /><br />So if whiskeys were cars, what would they be and why?<br /><br />To kick off, I'm going to suggest that Old Comber is like a DeLorean: released in the Eighties after a long gestation period, received a lot of media attention (not all of it good), put together in the North, looks the part but performance perhaps doesn't live up to expectations, yet years on still has a small coterie of devoted followers.<br /><br />Any more?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">I agree with David above, although my Tullamore Dew is my Lincoln Navigator.<br /><br />Yes, the Nav is a ridiculously large American SUV, but I use mine for a work truck, everything I need can be stored in it, with plenty of room left.<br /><br />(The Navigator does go a bit overboard, with a full kitchen and a master bedroom, but even I think the dance floor is a bit much LOL) (Just kidding!)</div>
