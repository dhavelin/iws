				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />The 12 year old was discontinued some time ago and almost unavailable in Irish retail outlets - to my knowledge there is none left in Dunnes or Tesco, with maybe a bottle here and there in the odd SuperValu or Centra, Eurospar or Londis Plus. Last I heard Fine Wines in Limerick were charging €120 a bottle for their last few bottles, and Ally in the CWS was asking €200!<br /><br />The 18 year old is still widely available. It was to be discontinued also but it got a 'reprieve'. I'd expect it to disappear from retail in the next 18 months. It is about €132 these days I think.<br /><br />Gold is also discontinued but is still available in a few Tesco stores, and in a good few retail outlets, for around €87.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Ian</div>

				<div class="content">From what I've seen Jameson 12 is very tough to find in stores in the U.S. for the past 12 months, unless you pay well above the old market price through a website(often $80-$100 USD)... that being said , a little research found some available at a Total Wine &amp; More in St Louis, Missouri (I'm in Minnesota).   I have a friend down in St Louis and he was nice enough to pick me up the last 3 bottles on the shelf at $56 per bottle.  The Jameson 18 and Jameson Gold Reserve still are plentiful at the larger stores in my area - I already have a few on reserve of both, but if the Gold is now discontinued I suppose I should grab a couple more for future consumption.</div>

				<div class="content">The Gold is discontinued but the 18 is saved. It's getting a makeover in the new year I'm told. Unfortunately makeovers usually entails a price increase.</div>

				<div class="content">I look forward to the redesign of the 18...though I'm sure your right on the price increase.  Midleton Very Rare  went up $20  for the 2017 release/redesign (From $129 US to $149)... Initial indications  via web reviews were that it would go to $200+ US ,  but I think the authors of those articles were including the European VAT before converting Euro to USD</div>
