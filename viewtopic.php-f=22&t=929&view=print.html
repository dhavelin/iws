				<div class="content">hey guys, what with schoolwork in full flow, it's been a while since i've dropped into the forum. Glad to hear the kilbeggan tasting went well. I was wondering, is this new peated version of the kilbeggan malt triple distilled like the standard malt? also, just out of curiosity, was it made before or after they stopped getting their low wines from Cooley proper? is it the same ppm that they use for Connemara? Also, i had heard that Brian Quinn was interested in making a PPS whiskey based on the old Lockes distillery recipe a while back (i remember reading that it might even have something like 5% oats in the mashbill); did anything ever come of that?</div>

It's the same stuff as Connemara.<br /><br />Triple-distilled though... has anything ever been triple-distilled from Cooley?<br /><br />The PPS was awaiting the ability to create mashes in Kilbeggan. They just have that in place now. Brian still intends to try the PPS.</div>

				<div class="content">Woah woah ... they have literally only started up the full process so this will be a seriously long term goal ... I can understand you eagerness but whiskey is a slow food (a big bizz word for the minute  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  ) So don't expect anything any time soon . The whole PPS scene is an aspirational thing and it will probably happen but we need to give them time to bed in. <br /><br />So what's going on in Kilbeggan??? Well I reckon they will start off distilling a simple malt which will ultimately be their Kilbeggan Distillery Malt and that will probaly be a must have form them. After that they can experiment with PPS ... and remember that is all they can do ... as remember there could be a scenario that the PPS they create does not pass the mustard. it is something that has not been done by cooley so they need to distill and learn.<br /><br />Cheers</div>

				<div class="content">wait, is the recently released kilbeggan malt double distilled or triple? for some reason i remember hearing that it was going to be a &quot;light, triple distlled malt&quot; as opposed to the riverstown malts, but that was ages ago. anyone have the scoop on this? interesting to hear that they've done a triple distilled run at riverstown</div>

				<div class="content">I might have contributed to that triple-distillation rumour because I mentioned it <a href="http://www.irishwhiskeynotes.com/2009/02/new-still-for-kilbeggan.html" class="postlink">here</a>. Before the second still arrived at Kilbeggan they said it was their intention to take wash from Riverstown and triple distil at Kilbeggan by running through the new still twice.<br /><br />Did they try that? I don't know. The spirit they have been getting from the small stills is really light so another distillation might be too much.<br /><br />Regardless of that, the current Kilbeggan malt comes from the period before the second still arrived so it's double-distilled.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know if they've triple distilled at Kilbeggan, but I believe that was the plan.  They did say at Cooley, however, that they have some triple-distilled stuff at Riverstown.</div>
