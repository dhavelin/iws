				<div class="content">It does need a link for proper attribution, which I added. And generally speaking, an article shouldn't be copied in its entirety to avoid breaching copyright. Either paraphrase or quote selectively and link back to the full article. Luckily, I happen to own RTE (and I top up my investment every year) so I think we'll be OK this time <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Cooley will be worried about the implications of this theft. The presence of Republican criminals in the border area is the reason they didn't warehouse in that neck of the woods for many years.</div>

				<div class="content">From the Forum Rules section:<br />&quot;No Spam, pornography, or posts infringe copyright. This includes posting of links, data or pictures&quot;. <br /><br />From this forum rule I understood that links were not allowed - which is why I provided none. Are links now mandatory? If so, perhaps the rule should be revised and updated. Either way I don't mind, we should possibly be more clear about this because a number of members are posting articles from other on-line media without links and I don't think anyone here is an expert on copyright law?<br /><br />Just something worth considering.<br />Cheers,<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">Good feedback, thanks. No links to spam or naughty stuff, is what was meant. I deleted a post for that only yesterday.<br /><br />Copyright is easy enough. Facts are not copyrightable, the manner in which they are expressed is. Copyright is automatic on publication, even if there is no copyright symbol. The &quot;Fair Use&quot; provision allows modest quoting of material under copyright for the purposes of discussion, provided there is attribution. Copyright expires (in Ireland, anyway) 70 years after the death of the author.<br /><br />The rest is politeness. A link encourages visitors to the site where the quote came from to see the rest of the article, which is good for them. Everybody gains. We expect others to do the same for our content.<br /><br />I'll update the rules to be clearer.</div>
