				<div class="content">Peter Mulryan's Irish Whiskey Guide is now available in the CelticWhiskeyShop and Hodges &amp; Figges amongst other outlets at approx €6.99.<br /><br />Pocket sized introduction to Irish Whiskey<br /><br />Title: Irish Whiskey Guide<br />Author: Peter Mulryan<br />Publisher: Appletree Press Ltd<br />Pages: 96<br />Cover: Softback<br />ISBN: 978-1-84758-120-4<br />Price: €6.95 - €7.50<br />Published: 2009<br />Official Release Date: 30 June 2009<br /><br />This small reference book contains six chapters,<br /><br />(1) The History of Irish Whiskey<br />(2) The Types of Whiskey<br />(3) How Whiskey is Made<br />(4) The Influences on Malt Whiskey<br />(5) The Enjoyment of Irish Whiskey<br />(6) Visiting Distilleries<br /><br />Review: This is an excellent introduction to Irish Whiskey. It covers all the basic facets of Irish Whiskey in a clear, easy to read, concise style. It is a very good roadmap for the Irish Whiskey novice which as the author himself puts it &quot;If it sparks your imagination there's a lot more to learn, if not then I heartily recommend it as a coaster.&quot;<br /><br />So if you don't know your malt from your pure pot still or your grain from your blends, this is a great little book to commence your journey into the evolving world of what Irish Whiskey means today.</div>

I got an email from him ...and the bad news guys is he has said that he has to put this project on ice as he is moving back to Wales from Belfast <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />He has already published a book entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.libertiespress.com/cartage.html?main_page=product_book_info&amp;cPath=10&amp;products_id=15&amp;zenid=ushr51fh29g3sdm3f791tllia2" class="postlink">Beer &amp; Cider in Ireland: The Complete Guide</a>&quot; and according to the <span style="font-weight: bold">Irish Craft Brewer</span> guys it is a very well researched book and the most comprehensive done on Irish beer. So in light of that I'm sure Iorwerth would not like to put out anything that has not been thoroughly researched.<br /><br />Sad news for us as it would probably of been a very comprehensive book but we can wait in hope.<br /><br /><br />Iorwerth has also had a few articles published in the Whisky Magazine (issues 57, 58 &amp; 62).</div>
