				<div class="content">I'd recommend you make the trip.<br />I was up there a few weeks back and they've been having continuing sales at the distillery. Currently the 1608 and black bush are really cheap.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd love too but there's only so many of the abandon the kids trips I can do in a year and I've a few planned already. I've going to visit a few friends in Belfast in the next few week but let's face it - Bushmills ain't exactly a small detour!</div>

				<div class="content">True. It's well over an hour further up the road from there.<br />It's a pity I didn't know you were looking for one before I went up. I got someone else one while I was up there.<br />But with them selling the 1608 for £30 a bottle at the distillery, I am tempted to try and get back there sometime soon.<br />If I can manage that, I'll certainly grab one for you. But sadly, they don't sell it anywhere else.</div>

				<div class="content">Is it much more than an hour?? You never know!<br /><br />The first bottle of this I bought was actually in Midleton (pre Diageo, obviously!) They used to do a sort of octagonal box with the 3 distillery reserves. Looking back I can't believe I only bought one of the boxes, I drank the whiskey and threw out the box. This was when I started getting into whiskey in a big way, maybe 6 or 7 years ago. I went back soon afterwards but never saw the set of 3 again. I reckon if I'd kept it it would have been a half decent collectors item in time. Though I probably would have jusk drank it again!</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Iain, I rang them a few years ago and bought one from the shop which they kindly posted me one down but your adding another £12 or so for the pleasure but it sure as hell beats forking out €40-50 in petrol  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> .</div>
