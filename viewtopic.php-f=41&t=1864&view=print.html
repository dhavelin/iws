				<div class="content">It's one of the rarer ones, going for more than the 1984 or 1985, but 900 is a very ambitions price. <br /><br />Good luck, though. You'd never know.</div>

A bottle could go for 100 euro one day and 500 another. Someone looking to complete a Midleton Very Rare collection might bite your hand off for it.</div>

				<div class="content">You could indicate what offers you would be prepared to entertain and ask people to PM you directly offline as we do not encourage selling on the forum, else approach the Celtic Whiskey Shop in Dublin, Ebay, Done Deal? or Whisky Auction in Germany... good luck</div>

				<div class="content">There is a lady with the user name SallyMS on a a topic in the collectors corner who is looking for Midletons, I've sold her a few you could send her a private message to see if she has this one or not, but again you'd need to lower your price further as she has picked up older Midletons for less than what you are looking for.</div>

As I recall a 1993 made 180 Euro, <br />a 1994 approx. the same. a 1992 around 240 euro as I recall. Some of those people quoting the <br />big prices would not be in a position to find a buyer at that price.</div>

				<div class="content">I think an estimate of €400-600 is not out of the question. The releases 1986-1989 seem quite scarce. Although The 1984 &amp; 1985 Come up quite regularly. I would not base prices on Mealy's alone as the target audience is limited. You would find that this would achieve much more in a dedicated auction like whiskyauction.com.<br /><br />But as mentioned the Irish whiskey market is quite volatile and open market prices do fluctuate.</div>

				<div class="content">There was an outer sleeve which elongated the box and the Crystal Tumbler was in a smaller box on top. For some reason Tipperary Crystal rings a bell but could be wrong. I used to have an advertising pic of it but it's stuck on an old computer <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />However don't get hung up on getting the bits that were attached as they would not have been on the full run of the vintage. <br /><br />Just an intact box and bottle with certificate is the key and even certificates are optional.<br /><br />The goal and the prize is the full collection and if you can then sell it you'll probably make a tidy profit.</div>
