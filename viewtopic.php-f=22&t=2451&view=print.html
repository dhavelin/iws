The Jim Beam Kentucky Dram is a bourbon that has been blended with a peaty Highland Scotch single malt to add smoky and earthy notes to Jim Beam's vanilla and oaky character.  It will be bottled at 40% ABV and will be available in the travel retail sector from mid-July.</div>

				<div class="content">I like the Beam idea in theory as I never really had any interest in the flavoured Whiskey's but a peated Bourbon is very tempting.<br /><br />Like to get my hands on this for a try  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /><br /><br />i would imagine the SWA can do very little about this also as long as it is not trying to be a scotch which I cannot see.<br /><br />Still very bourbon looking in the bottle and even spell their product Whiskey, best of luck to them I say ...<br /><br />a drop of Laphroaig in your Bourbon anyone <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />   (Although it could also be Bowmore but I prefer the idea of Froyig  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> )</div>
