				<div class="content">There may be people on this forum who are interested, but you'd need to indicate what sort of money you'd be looking for. Just to let you know though, there may be others who aren't keen on the idea of using the forum to buy/sell. I don't have any strong opinion either way.</div>

				<div class="content">We don't want anyone selling here professionally but if it's something you found in the back of the kitchen press then go ahead  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> There is a good chance someone here will be interested. I'm going to rename the thread because it conveys no useful info at the moment.</div>

				<div class="content">Of course asking where you might sell something would probably not upset anyone as technically you wouldn't be trying to sell it here. The Celtic whiskey shop might also be interested though I've no idea what you'd get there.</div>

				<div class="content">2 years ago you could of made a killing on these but they have gone down a bit since then.<br /><br />In the current climate these are probably worth €225-250 each. They used to get much more but I think the rush on them has gone.<br /><br />But you could get lucky at auction.<br /><br />As mentioned <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">whiskyauction.com</span> is one avenue but these are german based operation and it is up to you to arrange delivery<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">ebay</span> this is the probably one of the better places to sell your bottle.<br /><br />Also contact the <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/" class="postlink">Celtic Whiskey</a> shop on Dawson Street Dublin 2 for a valuation as they may offer you something for them.</div>
