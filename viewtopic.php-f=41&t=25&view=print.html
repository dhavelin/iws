				<div class="content">I found a bottle of Gilbey's Red Breast - John Jameson &amp; Son's 10 Years Old Liqueur Whiskey in the cupboard.  I was told that it is probably from the 60s or 70s.   Would anyone have an idea of its value?  Thanks for any information!</div>

				<div class="content">Late 60's Eary 70's is a good estimate.<br /><br />And I think the top end of my last estimate is a fair estimate, maybe €200-250 .<br />Wait an see what others think but reckon I'm close enough.<br /><br />The problem with this however is you may not realise that on ebay.<br /><br />I've seen them got for less than 200Dollars in Ebay US.<br /><br />Where are you based?</div>

				<div class="content">Yes that looks like the later bottling of Gilbey's Redbreast 10YO, bottled between mid 1960s and 1972/3. Jameson stopped supplying Gilbeys with the closure of the Bow Street Distillery in 1971. However Gilbeys continued to bottle Redbreast until 1985 following which Irish Distillers purchased the brand. A specialist retailer would sell that bottle for up to €300 (Insurance Value), but buy it for between €150 - €200.<br />A fair collectors price would be around €200 - €240.<br /><br />Hope this information is helpful.<br /><br />If your thinking of offering it for sale please pm me on this forum alternatively by email on <!-- e --><a href="mailto:lphelan1@hotmail.com">lphelan1@hotmail.com</a><!-- e --></div>

				<div class="content">I wouldn't mind trying it either myself.  Although there is a pub in Galway with a bottle, Tigh Neachtain, they flog it at E30 snots a glass, but the barman inside told me it tasted just like todays stuff.<br /><br />If its open a while it can really soften up, the old stuff had be different you'd think, being made with oats, wheat and rye as well.</div>

Therefore I reckon that this will be a much finer whiskey. The thinking is that the RB 12yos of the eighties were filled using the last remaining independently controlled stocks of Redbreast. There is a possibility that all stock over 12years was used and much older casks past their best may have been used in the mix or just in certain batches who knows. Therefore if there was a lot of over aged pps it may have brought down the quality. <br /><br />I am wondering though if the bottle that everybody talks about is just a dud that's been open too long. I've had a RB 12yo too and did not find it repulsive but I did not find it was anywhere near as good as current RB 12yo. I did find that it had this dull sweetness with the musty PPS character that we talk about with the older Midleton PPS however I also found that there was a kind of orange flavoured children's medicine quality to it too which was not very appealing.</div>
