Today i have spent several hours on it and it looks real bargains are still possible. Especially for scottish whiskey, at least that's how it seemed to be today.

				<div class="content">No but think they are fairly new and looks okay. 13 auctions have now run through and I've not heard anything negative which you would imagine you'd hear before you hear positive comments.<br /><br />here are the charges ...<br /><br />WHAT IT COSTS<br /><br />We charge a seller's premium of 10% plus £3 per lot to cover handling, photography and upload to the website and £4 for each reserved item. Buyers also pay 10%, plus postage if required, and a 3% credit card surcharge. There are no charges for debit cards, cheques ... or cash! Buyers can collect in store on receipt of your invoice.<br /><br />So not sure if it would be worth it on a bottle of Ardbeg as currently Ardbeg is circa £35 anyway and you probably can get it for €45-50 here so after charges and postage not overly worth it unless your desperate for a 2005 version  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> .</div>

				<div class="content">I've used them a bit. Used to be better value, because they were charging no % commission at the begining. A few teething problems early on, but that's sorted now. <br /><br />They charge the seller and the buyer, so it's not any better value now than whiskyauction.com. They don't generally get any interesting Irish whiskeys, generally. <br /><br />Bottles fetch a high  enough price on the webiste, but commission higher than auction houses.</div>

There are so many possibilities in these type of bottling's that it is not unusual not to hear od these further the majority are totally un-verifiable in regards to contents so I'd not place much value in them. More like curios and some of the labels are great so nice to have. The aged ones would probably be nice to explore and taste and could well be a few gems there.<br /><br /><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>good_whiskey_hunting wrote:</cite>LOT.290<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Redbreast 12 Year Old</span>, Rare Old Irish Whiskey, John Jameson &amp; Son, bottled by Gilbeys of ireland, 26 2/3 Fl.
