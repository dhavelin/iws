I would be interested in the final price of the Redbreast. They were common enough a few years ago but now seem to be getting a premium price.

I believe the previous batch was issued in 2008 (though I would appreciate being corrected, if necessary).<br /><br />A late Christmas gift came from a good friend of ours in California who got me Sullivan's Cove Double Cask from Tasmania Distillery in Australia.  Really looking forward to trying this one, though I will likely be waiting until spring, after several other bottles have been finished.</div>

I usually put on a bid on in the first or the last day with a realistic maximum and hope for the best. <br /><br />I picked up the Càrn Mòr Single Grain 1973 today. Its for my 40th later in the year.<br /><br />I also got Redbreast 15 for €55. I thought it would surely be out bid but wasn't.
