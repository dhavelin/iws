This bottle is a nicely peated/smokey whisky that doesn't go overboard on either note...a more approachable version (sans medicinal notes) of it's quarter cask cousin, the Laphroaig Quarter Cask.  Waiting for the Ardmore to come back to Ontario...and yes, it is a great deal, which may be to its' detriment in terms of peoples' perception of its quality.</div>

				<div class="content">Last week, I was fortunate enough to pick up one of the last bottles of Four Roses Limited Edition (2013) 125th Anniversary bottle that was available in Ontario.  I loved a sample of the FR Mariage when I was able to try it about three years ago (I think it was FR's Limited Edition bottling from 2009).  I had been on the lookout for the Mariage ever since.  When I read reviews and tasting notes about the 125th bottle, I realized it would be my best shot at getting something that approximated the Mariage.  Can't wait to try it, though it may not be for a little while.</div>

				<div class="content">Two and a half weeks ago found me in Niagara Falls, NY at a Volbeat concert (if you like heavy rock with a little country/rockabilly influence...definitely something different...check them out!  Their current 'heavy play' songs on satellite radio are &quot;Lola Montez&quot; and &quot;Dead but Rising&quot;).  That gave me the opportunity to pick up a bottle of Old Grand Dad 114.  It has been one of my favourite whisk(e)y experiences when I have tried it in the past.  As an added bonus, it was only US$29 after tax!!  Looking forward to trying it this summer.</div>

				<div class="content">I've packed in on &quot;spending money&quot; on redicilously priced limited editions or so called rare old whiskies. I'm convinced it's all a con anyway.<br /><br />On our recent trip to portugal pickec up nothing on the way out through The Irish Whiskey Collection store in shannon as there was Zero value to be had really. All pretty much premium high street prices with a few boring exceptions on special  <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" /> <br /><br />I was hoping to nab a Writers tears but alas they had none of the regular just the stupidly priced &quot;Single Cask&quot; version  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />Picked up a liter of Johnnie Walker Spice Road for €34 on the way back in Faro which is fairly ok but to be honest I don't hold out much expectation for the contents but I'm sure it will be very drinkable.<br /><br />However I did find a shop locally where we stayed that had a Lagavulin 16yo for €53 which I think was a bit of a bargain. A similar type shop in closer to the tourist centre had one for €64 while Ally charges €77.<br /><br />So all in all a good buy. Looking forward to trying both though. Been a while since I've had a bottle of Laga 16.</div>

				<div class="content">Sad ... and even sadder is the fact is my last 7 Whiskey purchases where not whiskey but Whisky (all down to price / value ratio) and the 2 Irish previous to that were single cask 21yo Cooley peated from a Scottish bottler for a fair price of circa €75 each, how much is Teeling charging for their 21year olds  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> . <br /><br />Out of all those 9 bottles only 1 was a blend and 1 was a NAS single malt but both were 1liter versions so added value there also. So if I use an average of 5 years for these and take an average age for my Whisky bought and average price for that same whiskey is goes to 12.25 years average and €49.70 average per bottle.

				<div class="content">Totally agree. We were talking about this last year when the price took yet another increase. I used to buy Redbreast 12 and Jameson when they were in the €30-€40ish price range but no longer. The prices are ridiculous and I can't see them changing.  It's offensive the way they are pricing the regulars out. I hope all these new distilleries don't follow the same policy.</div>

				<div class="content">The key seems to be to stock up in North America if any of you are able to cross the pond.  Decent selection in big US cities.  Redbreast 12 is around Can$62 and Writer's Tears (standard, not CS) is Can$53 in Ontario (about same in US).  Powers John's Lane is apprx US$70 depending on what store you see it in, in the US.</div>
