Use the upload tab to post a picture from your pc. If it is too big I can sort it out for you.</div>

It's not going to be worth huge money anyway as it was just a blend. If from the 70's it's probably only worth 40 or 60Euro but one from the 60's will probably be worth a bit more. But it would be hard to tell whether it was 60's or 70's unless we had a picture. If from the 80's only worth about 30Euro. But in saying it is 70% it is probably pre 80's. Does it have a Green or Brown bottle?  Off White or cream label? Is the crest red or yellow? Is the crest round (ish) or shield like? Does it have a neck collar? We really need to know the minute detail to date it and a picture is the only way.<br /><br />70% proof is equal to 40% abv and we officially changed to abv in 1980.</div>

It has a cork and doesn't state size or strength.<br /><br />Is your one similar?<br /><br />I don't know what there worth but I know there worth but I've had good offers for the one with the cork.</div>

So looking for the same kick as the market leaders of the time, the only difference was Crested Ten was sherried like it's younger brother Jameson. Had a high pot still content too in the early years of over half.</div>
