				<div class="content">Sorry was on my phone yesterday so not ideal for doing a report on Fox &amp; Geese.<br /><br />Well first off it may not be everybody's cup of tea as it is purely an industrial complex doing a very industrial job.<br /><br />However I found it fascinating and was delighted to have the opportunity to see this part of the operation. I'll not go into to it in detail as I think Whiskey Notes will be doing a report but what I can say is that I was very impressed with the efficiency of the operation. An interesting piece of history is that is was first used as a Power's bonded warehouse. Further it pretty much bottles all Jameson for the entire world market bar a contingency site that does some also.<br /><br />Later that evening we had a wonderful night which was never going to follow the schedule and ran way over the times but it showed what an entertaining evening we had. We had a tasting of 8 samples and a wonderful meal which was very nicely prepared and had a special cask sample for after the meal which finished of the meal beautifully. It was a bourbon cask which apparently is on site in the OJD and given out at special occasions  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />If I had time I'd give a better account but a house full of sick children here  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Just have to say a massive thank you to the Guys at Fox &amp; Geese for an excellent day and a huge appreciation to David Byrne and Liam Donnegan and all the Staff at the OJD for a wonder night to remember.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks David and well done a nice write up ... I liked you finishing lines about the calm there as that is totally true.

I didn't catch Michael's full name and title so I can now add credits to my own post.<br /><br />Is there a way to get notified of updates to that Single Pot Still site? I'm registered but these news items don't come to me automatically and I don't see an RSS feed.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>Do they produce barley from their udders?</div></blockquote><br />Don't be silly. They eat the barley, malt a portion of it in one stomach, mash and ferment it in another stomach and the wash is available via the udder. Attempts to add the distillation step have been fruitless to date, and lethal to the cows due to the required methane combustion.</div>
