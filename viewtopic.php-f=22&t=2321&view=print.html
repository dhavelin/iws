				<div class="content">I have always thought these Crowd funding pages were a slight bit of a rip off looking for money basically for nothing and gimickey but if they can do it fair play to them.<br /><br />The casks are being priced at circa â‚¬6000. If that includes Duty &amp; VAT it is not too bad actually for a 3yo whiskey but would depend on further yearly storage costs but if not it is seriously expensive and Dingle I fear will have set a very dangerous precedent on cask pricing.<br /><br />I like their branding though and wish them the best of luck asd we all want to see more Irish Whiskey Distilleries on the horizon.</div>

				<div class="content">Fair play. Certainly very different. That area needs something<br />to help bring it up. The regeneration proposal for the village shows<br />that there will be something in t for the community as well !</div>
