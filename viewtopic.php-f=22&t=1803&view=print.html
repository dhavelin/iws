				<div class="content">I'm holding a fundraising event in December to raise money for Citywest Educate Together National School.  <br /><br />It'll be an Irish Whiskey tasting along giving an introduction into different Irish Whiskeys.  It'd be great if people could support this as it's frightening how much money schools need to fund raise every year.<br /><br />The tasting will be held in Citywest Hotel (at the end of the Luas Red Line, Saggart stop) on the 14th December starting at 8PM places can be booked here:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookwhen.com/citywestetns">http://www.bookwhen.com/citywestetns</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />If you can't make it but would like to make a donation please contact me .... it would be much appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">While this tasting was canceled due to poor numbers of people interested in Citywest I'd like to express my gratitude to forum member mawhinney for his generous donation of a signed naggin of Green Spot whiskey for auction at the IWS Christmas party.  Bidding was brisk and reached a total of 60 euro.<br /><br />The donation and the bidding were very generous and will be appreciated by the school and such unsolicited generosity needs to be commended, my thanks, and those of  school for the donation and for all the bids on the night.</div>
