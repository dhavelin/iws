				<div class="content">New Whiskey &amp; New Committee <br /><br />The Society's latest Bottling was unveiled. It's a Midleton 18 year old Grain, yes Midleton Grain. This is the first ever release of a Grain whiskey from them. <br /><br />That was the first of the night. It wasn't numbered. I tried it last as I'd missed the beginning. <br /><br />Here's the order. <br />1-Tullamore Black 43<br />2-Irishman 12 limited edition. <br />3-Green Spot 10 <br />4-Dair Ghaelach Tree 4 C/S<br />5-Redbreast Mano A Lámh <br />6-Glendronach 1995-19 year old C/S<br />7-Port Charlotte PC-12<br /> <br />I'd only tried the Irishman, Green Spot &amp; Redbreast before. I was impressed by all. The Midleton Dair Ghaelach was voted favourite. I believe the Glendronach was well in the running too. Good idea bringing in the Scottish Whisky to mix things up.</div>

				<div class="content">You're killing me, you're really killing me! My first trip to Ireland is less than a week past and this is what I just missed! Cheers to all. At least everyone in Chicago thinks I brought back a major haul with my Crested Ten and my Lockes 8 year and my Palace Bar.  I think it's a major haul too and can't wait to get back! I wish I could say it in Irish!!</div>
