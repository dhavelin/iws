				<div class="content">Sounds like a mouth of marbles but I was keen to get my hands on this.<br /><br />Ever since my trip to Springbank enroute to Islay in October 2007 these barrels had stuck out in my mind. I reckon it was purely down to seeing the casks in the warehouse. They stood out a mile as they were very pale (white) oak and really beautifully made. You could of nearly used them as flooring they appeared so clean but it would be a nuisance to have to walk over a hump in your flooring all the time  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />Anyway this is only a 7yo and a Longrow which in essence means it is a peated Springbank.<br /><br />What an interesting whiskey<br /><br />A beautiful light diluted Brown chestnut colour <br /><br />I could see the nose putting people off this whiskey as it is really strange at first.<br /><br />There is a real earthiness to this, kinda Lagavulin like, and heavy raw malt. I thought it was quite spirity at first but this seems to subside. Ripe fruits and plasticine &amp; wax and some other heavy aromas I can't put my finger on at the moment. There is a heaviness to the nose the components of which don't seem to tie together.<br /><br />The taste however is rewarding and quite springbankish (ginger) but I just totally forgot to take any further notes  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" />  I'll post back again tomorrow.</div>
