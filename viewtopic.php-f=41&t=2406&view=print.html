				<div class="content">Hi folks,<br /><br />I've had an inquiry through the contact form on one of my own sites from a chap who has discovered an old whisky branded water jug.<br /><br />The branding says Inishargy Whisky (yes Whisky!) with Dixon and McKnight Ltd Belfast. See attached Pic.<br /><br />I know that the Irish Distillery Ltd in Connswater operated from 1886 1929 and was built for the new land owners by the previous site owner Dixons Timber who built the distillery as part of the property sale.<br /><br />A quick check shows me that there was a company in Belfast called Dixon and McKnight in Belfast in 1912 (Titanic year).<br /><br />I have also explained to the jug owner that the terms whiskey and whisky were loosley used in those days for Irish made whiskey.<br /><br />I'm guessing that Inishargy was a makey up brand for export?<br /><br />If anyone else can shed more light, I'd be very grateful.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Stuart</div>
