				<div class="content">sounds good, do you guys have anything planned for July yet by any chance or is that still too far off? I spoke with the college administration here today and i have to take a summer course to fulfill one of my overlooked degree requirements so i wont be in dublin as early as i thought. If i dont make the independence day tasting i can still try to bring over some interesting ryes or bourbons just for the society's future use</div>

				<div class="content">We're Turning Japanese!<br /><br />It was probably one of the most successful acts of industrial espionage ever. <br />In 1917, as World War 1 raged, a 23 year old Japanese student moved to Scotland to study chemistry in Glasgow. <br />Soon afterwards, he got a job at Hazelburn distillery, where he learnt many of the secrets of distilling good Scotch.<br />He took this knowledge with him back to the Far East, where he helped found not one but three whisky distilleries across Japan.<br />Today, the Japanese whisky industry produces vastly more whisky than Ireland does, and has garnered a reputation of quality that matches even that of Scotland.<br />Many Scottish noses were put out of joint when a Japanese whisky was announced the best in the world in 2006. But again and again, they have repeated that feat.<br />Here in Ireland, where whiskey was born, Japanese whisky is almost unknown. <br />Now the Irish Whiskey Society intends to introduce Irish whiskey fans to the wonderful drams that come from the Land of the Rising Sun.<br />IWS Committee member Zoltan Vari travelled to Japan and visited three of the country's top distilleries: Nikka, Yamazaki and Hakushu.<br />He brought back some fascinating stories, some striking pictures and most importantly some bottles from his exploration of Japanese whisky.<br />Join Zoltan and the Irish Whiskey Society on Thursday May 27th at 7.30pm in Brooks Hotel, Drury Street, Dublin 2, to explore whiskey's best-kept secret – the drams of Japan.<br /><br />Background information:<br />The Irish Whiskey Society is Ireland's only society dedicated to our national spirit.<br />Founded only a year ago, the society holds monthly tastings in the Dublin area with the aim of encouraging an appreciation of Irish whiskey and the whiskeys of the world, and there's nothing we love more than enjoying them in the company of friends.<br />Our website - <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com">www.irishwhiskeysociety.com</a><!-- w --> - is already established as the authoritative home of objective whiskey discussion and information online, and receives thousands of visitors each month.<br />Please sign up to our regular e-bulletin at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com">www.irishwhiskeysociety.com</a><!-- w --> to keep informed about all developments in the world of Irish whiskey.<br />The Irish Whiskey Society promotes the responsible enjoyment of alcohol.</div>

				<div class="content">Brief feedback,<br /><br />The line-up on the night was (1) Nikka All Malt (2) Tsuru 17yo (3) Hakushu 12yo (4) Yamazaki 12yo (5) Hibiki Blend and finishing with (6) Yamazaki Ltd Ed Sherry Cask.<br /><br />At the end there wasn't much to chose between 2,3,4 &amp; 5 with a wide spread of admirers. However the winer on the night was the Tsuru 17yo by a whisker. The much anticipated  Yamazaki Ltd Ed Sherry Cask was a big disappointment apart from a small coterie of fans of very heavy sherry finishes at the back of the room.<br /><br />At the end of the night we got the opportunity to try the recently bottled private single cask bottling of Tyrconnell 17(and a half) year old, which was enjoyed by most present, a few seasoned observers expressed a preference for the CWS Tyrconnell 17yo Single cask.</div>
