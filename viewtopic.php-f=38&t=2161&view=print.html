				<div class="content">St pattys day is coming up again. Since it was my DADs  birthday, we have a small family gathering. I made 5 gallons of ale and added a dash of chocolate malt th make it a  bit dark. Guinisses is way to strong for me so this is my Almost Irish style beer. I am still on a very  mild chemo((( pills)) and will soon take another shot at IRISH STYLE WHISKEY. I hope i can be  a bit more active as i really enjoy this site.<br />SCOTTY</div>

My father CARMINE SESTINO FITZPATRICO SCOTTO DECHICARELLO  was born on 3/17 and  so my grandmother added fitzpatric to his  spagetti covered name-- We look foreward to 3/17 every year -But i dont doubt that some celts passed through italy at one time or another.
