				<div class="content">Yes ZOLTAN, I'd agree these bottles are totally over valued and unless the accompaning journals represent a major insite into the Irish Distilling industry these are just possibly 9 bottles of bad whiskey with some distillery curious from the 50's. The low level bottles would be very suspect what ever about the fuller bottles.</div>

				<div class="content">Hopefully it was IDL, went to the pre-sale viewing of the lot in Whyte's auction room on Molesworth St. An interesting archive of ledgers, sample notebooks, almanacs, old distilling laws etc. notes on the request for samples by Mr Norbert (Master Blender?) relating to blends of Paddy &amp; Hewitts. Also some blend requests from individual customers (presumably UK spirit merchants etc) as sales of casks were still popular at that time, a practice did not die out until the late 1960s. The documents as far as I can tell came out of the North Mall bottling facility when it was being cleared out/modernised?<br /><br />Most of the whiskey seemed to be cask strength form 1940s/1950s, would be very interesting to compare the output from that period to today's.  <br /><br />If IDL bought it, it would return to it's rightful home.<br /><br />Must enquire about the company archives at some stage, love to do some research to compliment my own</div>
