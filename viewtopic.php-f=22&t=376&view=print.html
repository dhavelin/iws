				<div class="content">Hi there welcome to the forum...<br /><br />The 1999 Midleton series are quite valuable, the RRP of the 25 yo is €1,000, 26 yo €1,200-1,600 30 yo €1,250-1,750.<br /><br />However collector prices are around €650, €900 &amp; €1,200 respectively as if you sell to a retailer he will give you 30-40% less than RRP due to having to charge VAT when he resells them...<br /><br />Others may disagree... however I would mention that values are falling as with all things to do with the recession the market is weaker.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>magoo wrote:</cite>thanks for the reply think i will hold onto them until recession is a memory.they still increased since i bought them and hope they stay that way.what else is worth buying at the moment.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Just a few words of advise ... The Irish whiskey market is in no way connected to the Scotch whisky market in the way prices keep escalate so I would not count on them rising any further than the lower values mentioned above. I personally think even those prices are a bit bullish and a 50% return on your original out lay maybe closer to the mark. So if you got offered anything close to the second two prices I'd snap their hands off.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong these are amazing whiskies but are out rageously overly priced and IDL have turned them into aspirational bottles. Further, collectors will know the original price of these and may not be willing to pay over the odds for the priviledge. It will all depend on how Irish progresses as a key whiskey segment in the next 5 years. We have seen double digit growth year on year for a good few years now however this has done little to generate a tangible collectors market as of yet. It is all guess work so Keep the fingers crossed but be realistic too.</div>
