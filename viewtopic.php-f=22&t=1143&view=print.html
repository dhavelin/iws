				<div class="content">I suspect this is too core a product to be playing too much with, could sneak it up to 43% though!<br /><br />Anyway the 2011 bottling is the 28th edition!!!<br /><br />Anyone got a 1988 so I can complete the series <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Fionnán wrote:</cite>speaking of things labelled Midleton, any word on when the Barry Crockett legacy SPS will be out?</div></blockquote><br /><br />It's bottled and ready to go but I think there was a delay issue in the production of the Wooden box which accompanies it. <br /><br />A pity really as they really wanted it on the shelves along with the new Powers at the same time. <br /><br />If your into packaging it seems like a decent effort. The box is wider, heavier and better quality than regular Midleton box and the bottle sits on a little single one bottle plinth in the box which can be taken out to display bottle on.</div>

				<div class="content">There may be other people on this site who can offer more advice than me in terms of sales methods. You've placed it in the collector's corner which is a good start. If you are in Dublin you could call to the Celtic Whiskey Shop on Dawson Street, the proprietor, Ally, might be willing to purchase it of you. Unfortunately even though it was the very first Midleton there are usually one or two of them floating about for sale and easy to find. The 85' and 86 are much harder to find. And can usually command a higher sale price. Also some of the more popular whisky websites, masters of malt and whisky exchange have a rare bottle section where you can email them and they might make you an offer for what you have to sell.</div>

				<div class="content">The 1985 pops up fairly regularly so I'd not go mad paying over the odds for that, 2 or 3 a year is fairly regular <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> .  A good few have being doing the rounds this year so they are out there.</div>
