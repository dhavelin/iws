				<div class="content">Was comparing various 21yo single malts over the weekend - Aberfeldy, Glenlivet, Benriach, Highland Park, and Lagavulin.<br /><br />Laga 21 is something really really special. Unfortunately the bottle is now empty.<br /><br />Out of all of these the HP21 was the one that impressed least. The closest in terms of style to it was the Aberfeldy which had a lot more going for it. The HP was just dull. IMHO of course. (BTW it was the 40% version).</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>IainB wrote:</cite>Yesterday I opened a newly acquired bottle of Hazelwood 110, the limited edition blend from all of Grants distilleries. (It was a birthday present.) Only had time for a small sample but my honest first impression is that is one of the finest whiskies I've vere tasted. Probably the best Scottish blend I've tried. Lovely combination of Chrismas cake and hney and surprisingly easy to drink at 55%. WOW! <br /><br />I think there's about 1600 bottles given to Grants employees - my suggestion to them is don't sell it on ebay - drink the thing! It's worth it. (I admit that's not helpful to non Grants employees, and in fairness if no one ever sold theirs I wouldn't have got a bottle!)</div></blockquote><br /><br />Finally got to try this and the JW Blue King George V.<br /><br />Tried over 2 nights as I was quite tired the first night. Anyway the first night I preferred the JW blue but on reflection it just meant it was easier to drink with out thinking about the whiskey.<br /><br />However on the second night the Hazelwood was the better and more complex whisky and was really nice.<br /><br />Nose: Sweet barley and sugar, spiced pear, sweetened coffee syrup, cinnamon Danish pastry .<br /><br />Taste: running along the same lines. Creamy soft and sweet with a brilliant burst of wood spice. Spiced fruit &amp; gloucose.<br /><br />Finish: Drying at first with some more spice and finishing long into sweetness.<br /><br />Don't know what is going on with me in relation to this but this whisky is like spending a lazy morning in a quite caf√©  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks for the samples Iain really enjoyed both.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

I think it is unbelievable how many different whiskey the are able to create, and each and every one has its on signature. All the whiskeys mentioned are released in the year 2011.<br /><br />And there are some more SPS.The Single Cask for T2 and CWS. On top of that there is a Jameson Select and of course the Midleton 2011.<br /><br />Thank you ID for all those whiskeys.

				<div class="content">Last night I had 3 of the Breast <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Redbreast 12yo, Redbreast 15yo and Redbreast 12yo CS.<br /><br />The new 15yo is surely a fine refined whiskey but still possibly quite up to the original. However I have to admit I preferred the 12yo CS currently. A Big Big whiskey and for me a wonderful extra dimension on the 12yo which is also a cracking drop. So all in all 3 great whiskeys.<br /><br />Just to top the night off I gave myself a slap around the face with the dregs of Laphroaig Triple wood. Slept soundly only to be called by work at 4am  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br /><br />Tonight Theakston's Old Peculier which either a stout or a dark ale. Nice roasted flavors .. so need a good gustsy whiskey to go with it. Picked on the Powers 12yo John's Lane as it's a long while since I have returned to this. I've been on a self imposed exile from whiskey for the last couple months so I was not sure how this would stack up. <br /><br />Well this is just the dogs ...and as good as I remembered it and better. Yes definitely well deserved of Irish Whiskey Society's whiskey of the year.<br /><br />I'm one happy camper this evneing  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>
