				<div class="content">I've always wondered how the celebration of Beannachtai na Feile Padraig compares from the USA to Ireland.<br /><br />Here in the USA, it is the second place finisher for the extreme overuse of alcohol (New Year's Eve is #1). People literally turn green (paint, clothes, fingernail polish, hair, etc) and consume green things (pizza, beer, bagels, anything that can be treated with green food coloring). They act like idiots, bars and taverns are avoided by those who don't wish to act stupid, lots of fights, drunken driving accidents and arrests, alcohol poisoning, hospital visits for various alcohol-related problems, and so on. Parades within two weeks either side of March 17 (so the different parades don't clash dates) with most spectators and a lot of marchers drunk.<br /><br />It is embarrassing for those of us actually descended from real Irish folks. I steer clear of the (usually destructive) party atmosphere.<br /><br />I know that St. Pat's is an official exemption from Lent, but I couldn't find anyone here who practices it anymore. (Might be some pious Catholics left around here, but they must be hiding)<br /><br />How is the celebration handled in Ireland? I've asked some of my cousins, still with the Auld Sod, and I can't get a decent answer.<br /><br />Keep 'em guessing...wear all black on St. Patrick's Day<br /><br />Slainte!</div>

				<div class="content">I didn't realise you had all that trouble in the US. I imagined it was more wholesome, for some reason.<br /><br />I haven't been to the parade in many years but I do see it on the TV. It has more razzmatazz these days - something we learned from you guys. It's also more of a &quot;festival&quot; than just a parade now. The city authorities try to keep it family friendly but unfortunately the day has an indelible association with excessive drinking, arrests, etc.<br /><br />I'm observing Lent, as it happens. Not for religious reasons, and just the giving-stuff-up part. I won't take a break for Paddy's Day because it makes that chocolate egg on Easter Sunday all the more delicious  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Thank you fellows for the answers. I had always assumed, through reports from some of my older relatives, that things were more dignified in Ireland. &quot;Dignity&quot; doesn't apply in most places in the US. Just a big excuse to drink to excess and party. Everyone is Irish on March 17, they dress in green outfits they wouldn't dare wear on Halloween / Samhain, and drink. And drink. And drink. <br /><br />The bigger Irish populations, such as New York City and Boston, of course have their traditional annual parades, huge affairs that get bigger each year. They all start out with dignity, but by the time the parades end, things get crazy, almost like riots in some places. There's an &quot;alleged&quot; Irish pub not far from where I live. One year my Dad and I went there to have a taste, about 10 in the morning, on St. Patty's Day. The owner said there were people at the door before he opened at 7 am. And they were already drunk.<br /><br />(Want to have fun? Stop by an American Irish pub and order in Irish. Nothing but blank stares! No Irish spoken in an Irish pub? Blasphemy!)<br /><br />Takes the fun out of it for me. I prefer something quiet, maybe I'm getting old. A nice dinner with my family, and with traditional food, like BOILED BACON!!! Corned beef is a travesty! Another Americanized holiday gone nuts.<br /><br />Rant over, I feel better now.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Go back a few years and it was a very parochial event very much tied into the schools and local associations and I suppose still is in lots of small towns around the country.<br /><br />As JC says it had quite a religious slant for a long time but we bought into the US version a while back so it is a big party now even though it was always a big drinking session too just more muted in behaviour. I must admit I never heard about the St Patricks days consession to lent.<br /><br />Dublin unfortunately  I think has done too good a job over the last few years creating a carnival aspect to the whole day and this has also brought out the yobs drinking on the street. It has always been a large drinking day but in recent times it has got messy but I don't think it is as bad as it has been reported with a small precentage ruining it for others. I suppose any big population with a day like this can get very messy. I must say though in all my years I have never once witnessed any unsocial behaviour during Paddy's day. However I have seen many very very drunk people. It really irks me to see that people can't enjoy our national day without getting totally plastered and yet keeping alive the hiddeous derogatory tag line &quot;The Fighting Irish&quot; when used in conjunction to the drinking culture. But we have no one to blame but ourselves ... maybe we need to send our drinking instructors to our American cousins to get them up to speed for Paddy's Day  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

These lushes do just fine bending their elbows.<br /><br />I only learned of the Lent connection a couple of weeks ago myself, reading it in an Irish-American newspaper (The Irish Voice). Makes sense, if most of the guys give up the drink for Lent, so how would they be allowed to celebrate March 17 if there wasn't some kind of exemption? St. Patrick is Catholic, right? Must be &quot;approved&quot; somehow  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />I haven't been Catholic for a long time, I forget most of it. The rules probably changed anyway...</div>

				<div class="content">i think it just depends where you go on paddys mothrae.  if you go to younger crowd bars then you are sure to deal with assholery and tomfoolery.  me and my family would always start with a nice breakfast and a few drinks at home.  then we would go to a nice laid back pub for a meal and drinks.  music would start later in the day and they would serve some traditional irish meals.  always had great times and never had any issues with drunks.  some people will always get carried away though.  and not just in america...all over the world.  ive seen my fair share of bad drunks here in ireland too.  i think there just might be more in america because its 300 million people vs. 4 million</div>

				<div class="content">My take on this is that people are the same all over the world. Even in those countries that profess themselves to be alcohol-free, the realities on the ground tend to be quite different to the mantras - fig wine anyone! Anyway, as was pointed out earlier on, St. Patrick's Day is now far more of a secular party than a religious day of observence and a perfect excuse for anyone who is so inclined to simply get 'hammered'. <br /><br />I will however continue to do my utmost to avoid the ususal 'I told you so' as and when I meet the errant bon-viveurs who have decided that mixing Guinness, Miller, Peach Snapps, Paddy and Jaegerbombs is a good idea. <br /><br />I prefer a distinctly more relaxed pace <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />John.</div>

The rules probably changed anyway...</div></blockquote><br /><br />Well you see as a Saint's feast day and the patron saint of Ireland's day it would have been a day where you do not follow your Lenten obligations.  There are a number of them, for example Sundays are not included in Lent, other days would vary from place to place.  Also St. Patricks Day used to be a dry holiday in Ireland like Good Friday (which is dry but not a Bank Holiday), and even now pubs etc. can only open after 12.30pm.<br /><br />A really traditional version would be to put a sprig of shamrock on your coat or jacket, go to mass and then watch the parade afterwards, normally with a fine mist blowing in your face.  Then home again for dinner.</div>

Keep it simple.</div>
