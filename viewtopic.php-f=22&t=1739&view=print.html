				<div class="content">and hopefully bring home (Michigan) a bottle or 4 of some great Irish whiskeys. Powers John Lane is on the list for sure, I'll look for some others as I travel. But having a hole for bringing home whiskey means I can bring some with me also. We are headed to Dublin, Belfast, Sligo, Galway and Kinsale, and if there is anyone who would like me to bring a bottle of something along that we may be able to trade let me know. If there is something you really need from the states, maybe I can accommodate it.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Dutch, I'm in Galway so could met with you for a swap, more for the fun of it and a meet up more than anything else. I can try and source a Yellow Spot for you which I believe is sold out in many areas but I might be able to get one of the few left in Galway but it is nearly 2 weeks since I was there at this stage.<br /><br />Ye are nearly doing a  full circle of the island fair play and hope ye really enjoy yourselves.</div>

				<div class="content">Adrian,  sounds good, anything you want me to try to bring in particular? Are you fond of bourbons at all? And I have had the Green Spot and really enjoyed it, so some Yellow would be great.<br /><br />Dutch</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Dutch,<br /><br />Yea I try a few US whiskey's when I can and possibly interested in another. Have had a good few over the years but would not know what's available too much as I don't pay enough attention. If you have anything to recommend feel free to drop a few names. I've had stuff like Basil Haydens (Liked), Makers Mark (Red, liked &amp; Black, loved), Jack Daniels of course some of their single cask offerings (nothing memorable). Woodford reserve(Liked/Ok), Georrge T Stagg (Only Okay) William L Weller (Loved), then stuff like four roses, Jim Beam and Wild turkey but pretty much bog standard stuff as well as Old Fitzgearld &amp; regular Buffalo Trace both of which again ok. Some said before by me taste that I prefer Rye but I'm not 100% sure but willing to give anything new a go.</div>

We have a winery over here that is taking some four year old Cooley and finishing it in petite shiraz (sp?) barrels for 4-6 months, it's called Concannon Irish whiskey, and those who have had it (myself included) consider it a decent dram for the price.</div>

				<div class="content">A big thanks to Dutch whom I met last night, he very graciously muled(transported) all the, way from the states a wonderful looking bottle of Beer barrel Bourbon from New Holland Artisan Spirits. See my latest purchase thread for more details. He also gave me a bonus of a Concannon Irish Whiskey  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Very grateful Dutch and I hope it was worth the Yellowspot trade. Enjoy the rest of your vacation and let us know how you get on with the yellowspot.</div>
