				<div class="content">Hi John,<br /><br />DO you have a bottle???<br /><br />I can only tell you what it says on the Bottle and box.<br /><br />Aquired in 1945??? (So this could mean it was actually distilled even earlier).<br /><br />Bottled in 1989<br /><br />Curiously it is a 750ml bottle.<br /><br />40%  abv<br /><br />Aged 44 Years (Probably should say at least 44years old)<br /><br />114 Bottles<br /><br />Came in a wooden box with 2 glencairn glasses and appeared on the market a few years ago exclusively in the CWS@(I think). So makes you wonder where these bottles were stashed for nearly 20 years ????<br /><br />Basically the box says. <br /><br />&quot;In 1945 William J Napier owner of the Central Bar in Lisburn aquired a cask of truely rare Irish Whiskey from the Tullamore Distillery. Due to extreme shortages at the time such a cask was worth more than it's weight in gold. Realising the Value of such an aqusition WIlliam decided to put the cask up in bond until it could be fully appreciated for all it's wonderful characteristics. 44 years later the cask came out of bond and was bottled. Only 114 bottles eventually made it into circulation of which I am one&quot;</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Adrian,<br />I actually have a bottle myself - but many thanks for going to the trouble of detailing the info above <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br />Trouble is when you go looking for more information about the cask etc. you seem to hit a brick wall. I've even corresponded with the manager at the Tullamore Distillery in the hope that they might have greater detail on file , but as yet to no avail. <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br />We'll crack the case eventually <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />Cheers,<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd say you'd be lucky to find out any more details, your best bet would be to ask Ally himself or contact the proprietors of the Central Bar in Lisburn. If the Knappogues are anything to go by, you'll find it difficult even to get a cask number. If you were determined enough you might be able to get the details from the bonded warehouse if you knew where it was stored.</div>

				<div class="content">It is quite reasonable that this would not be catalogued ... Firstly the way this has been marketed it might read that this whiskey was bought specially to be kept for a good day. However I very much doubt it though ... What you probably have here is a cask of whiskey which was bought for bar use and forgotten. It was normal and common place for bars to get in casks of whiskey. Further the pub in question may have gone through a  wholesaler/agent to get said whiskey therefore no real paper trail to follow from the Distillery.</div>

				<div class="content">Bought for bar use then forgotten.<br /><br />When the owner passed away the family decided to bottle it. Now they never got anyone to bottle it, they done it themselves first. Yes they cut the whiskey with good old tap water and stuck it in a bottle!  As a result the whiskey was sent to Scotland where it under went some teatment to return it to its original state and bottled properly!</div>

				<div class="content">Correct it was released at a price of €500 and if your lucky there may even be one still available in Celtic Whiskey Shop but I could not be sure. If he's looking for more give me a shout and I may be able to do something for you.</div>
