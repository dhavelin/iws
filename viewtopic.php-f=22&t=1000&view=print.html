				<div class="content">It's a really lovely whiskey, in my opinion and much more keenly priced in the US than here in Ireland. <br /><br />It's got a little bit of chocolate, dried fruit and spice about it. There's a new version since the first one and I have not tasted it yet, if it has been released.</div>

				<div class="content">I suppose it's just that they think we'll pay that much for it. The different taxes don't account for the difference. They'll sell a lot more in the U.S. than they will here.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi pennyanmurph and welcome, I notice from the Introduce yourself thread that you mention you are a whiskey novice. Well I hope you enjoy the ride and what a bottle to be drooling over  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />The Pro's about buying such a bottle is it really is a glorious whiskey but the price in Ireland makes it very much a careful buy. <br /><br />However the Con's to you buying this is that you are launching your new intrest straight in to the top and there is every fear that you may find everything else a dissappointment after that, which would be a shame.<br /><br />It's like learning to drive in your dads spare car then your first car being a 10yo rust bucket and after a year up grading to an Aston Martin DB9 .... do you think you could then go down to a Toyota  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />However if you have the means go for it as these will not be around for ever and you can always leave it to oogle over for a while before you burst into it. I am being a bit melodramitic though so doubt if it will actually put you off others.<br /><br />Have fun in your journey.</div>

				<div class="content">I took your advice Chaser, and for now am trying the Jameson 12 year.  I am enjoying it as I type in fact.  I may still get the Vintage Reserve because I may not have the spare cash much longer, but if I do, it will be a decoration for a while.  It seems that working up to it is going to be quite fun!  Thanks for the help guys.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Pat</div>

				<div class="content">I do have a recomendation, in my opinion if you like Jameson (and i havent met anyone who doesnt) try the gold, it usually runs about 60 dollars or under that and you will not be sorry. Its one that is very tasty and you wont feel bad about opening.</div>

A bit more expensive over here though. €67Euro which is closer to $100  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>
