				<div class="content">Kieron here from New Zealand.<br /><br />Been collecting Irish-Whiskey for 15 years now (I'm Irish) and I quite enjoy the odd tipple or two. Nobody here in our town ever drank any before I landed 9 years ago but I'm trying to wean them off the dreadful Bourbon they dring here. My local Bottle Store now stocks Jameson's, Powers, Redbreast, many Bushmills &amp; some Cooley brands!<br /><br />I have a largeish collection of openers, corkscrews, mirrors, crocks, advertising and some full bottles inc. a circa 1910 Powers, a full 1932 William Jameson 10 year old, a 40 year old Old Comber, a Dunvilles, and two Bushmills Millennium Malts - The Angels Share. I also have an early 18th century book on a public inquiry held into the manufacture and sale of Spirits in the UK and its packed full of actual testimony from ALL distillers of the period inc. JJ &amp; J Power.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Kieron welcome to the forum,<br /><br />You are the only other person I know who has a William Jameson 10yo (extremely rare)<br /><br />Love to see a pictures of your older bottles especially the Old Comber 40yo which I've never seen. The 1910 Powers would also be fascinating to see.<br /><br />As far as the Angels Share Millennium bottling I think they were bottles over and above the expected yield from the Millennium Casks.<br /><br />In relation to your book what is the title, not the 'Truths about Whisky' book, sounds interesting.<br /><br />Great to have you on board, as the website and forum develop...</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks. I'll grab a few photos tomorrow and post them. The Powers bottle is full but in poor shape .... most of the label gone. I believe I have a few other W J items too and a nice George Roe item too.  It guts me but 30 years ago I was involved in demolition an a Dublin distillery abd the offices were full of documents ... all was burnt .... I still have nightmares on this ....</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br /><br />My name is Shane, and Im living in the west of Ireland (Mayo), I have been collecting bottles of spirits from all over the world for some fifteen years. Most of them are just local produce that look unusual and/or cool!! However I have over the years picked up some quality Whiskeys and Brandys. I kinda thought they would be a good investment as the years go by!! I dont drink any of the collection and only have the odd hot whiskey in wintertime. I suppose there will be one hell of a wake after I bite the dust!!!!<br /><br />I would love to have the collection valued and wonder how one might go about it if anyone can offer advice?</div>

I dont really buy beer these days, maybe a few Samuel Adams (just to mix things up a bit).<br /><br />Anyway, I am more into Scotch whisky than Irish (although my Irish whiskey only ever involved Powers and Jameson - Powers is ok but I cant stand Jameson).<br /><br />I am interested though to find out more about Irish whiskey in the future, especially Connemara.</div>
