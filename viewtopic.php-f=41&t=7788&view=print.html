				<div class="content">I recently inherited some old unopened bottles of liquor, all had be stored in a dark cabinet since at least sometime in the seventies so the labels are in pretty good shape and there has been little if any evaporation of the contents. One was a bottle of Gilbey's RedBreast John Jameson &amp; Sons Ten Years Old Liqueur Whiskey, 1 U.S. quart, Produce of Ireland. Having read a number of the comments about the 12 year old RedBreast and some of the auction prices I'm trying to find out just what I actually have and what it may be worth. This info would nice to know so I can tell my friends about. If I don't sell it I may just decide to open and share it with friends when I retire in a couple of years as the descriptions make it sound like very good whiskey. Any information anyone would care to share would be greatly appreciated. I've included a few photos for you to look at. Thanks in advance for the info.</div>

				<div class="content">I also have the exact same bottle but can not find any info other than it was discontinued in 1985. Based on the style of bottle, flat on bottom, I'd likely assume it was bottled in the '60's.</div>
