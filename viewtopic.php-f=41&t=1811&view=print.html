				<div class="content">Hello my name is Nick, i'm from the United States and i'm hoping someone may be able to help me. Tonight my grandparents cottage on Devils Lake in the Irish Hills in Michigan burned down. My grandparents names are Charles and Ann Jameson. The fire took with it a very special thing to my family. It was a 3 1/2 foot tall dancing leprechaun that said &quot;Jameson Irish Whiskey&quot; on it. For 30 plus years that leprechaun hung at the peak of the living room. My whole family would sit around and make up stories about the leprechaun. My grandparents are the two most wonderful people on the planet and I cannot begin to explain what they mean to me and the rest of my family. I would like more than anything to find a replacement for that piece that was lost but i cannot find so much as a picture of it online. If this reaches the right place and you think there may be a chance for assistance, i'm sure i could find a picture of him. It looked to be made out of cardboard or some other kind of thick paper but it hung so high I cant be sure what it was made of. Thank you very much for reading this and I pray you may be able to help. <br />sincerely<br />nick heise</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Nick, Sorry to hear of yere misfortune. To answer your question it does not sound<br />as if this piece was ever used as advertising over this side of the pond. I never recall<br />seeing anything like it over here. As it was approx. 30 yrs.old it is either from a Jameson<br />advertising campaign specifically done in the U.S. or else is a spurious sign made up<br />for sale in the Irish American Community.  Some of the cask ends that one sees for sale<br />fit into this category and are aged in appearance only. If you have a photo post it and somebody<br />may be able to fill in the blanks.</div>
