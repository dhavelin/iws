				<div class="content">My collection is pretty simple, mostly Irish pot stills with a couple of smoky scotches. I want to start playing with some non smoky scotches, something thats a little less rich than all the pot stills and something without smoke.<br /><br />Ive tried Glenfiddich 12 and wasnt too impressed, found it &quot;starchy&quot;, with an aftertaste kind of like the taste you get from potcheen, tasted much younger than its 12 years. Also tried Glenmorangie 10 and thought it was not bad, but think i need to try another sample to know what i think for sure.<br /><br />Would like some recommendations in the 40-70 euro price range on some lighter scotches. Something a little more in line with the bushmills 16, but also with its own flavour and character.<br />Thanks for any help.<br /><br />current collection is:<br />Jameson Caskmates<br />Jameson Black Barrell<br />Powers John Lane Signature.<br />Ardbeg 10<br />Lagavulin 16<br />Bushmills 16<br /><br /><br />I want</div>

Maybe consider Deanston?</div>

				<div class="content">Balvenie Doublewood is a good suggestion<br /><br />Also the following should be okay to try<br /><br />Aberlour 10yo<br /><br />Auchentoshan Three Wood<br /><br />Although this next one has a touch of smoke it is not in anyway over powering or aggressive and I always thought Dalwhinnie 15yo was a lovely approachable whiskey, have not had it in a long time though. Honey and heather and soft.<br /><br /><br />And also as already mentioned some Macallans</div>

				<div class="content">Glendronach 12 or 15 Revival. Dahlwhinnie 15 - floral and a bit too sweet for me, but anyway worth to try. Dailuaine 16 f&amp;f, abunadh. Id go for one of this.</div>

				<div class="content">As well as some of those already mentioned, I think Glengoyne, Macallan Fine Oak, Glenkinchie and Bunnahabhain. <br /><br />Not sure if you want the sherry influence if you want the scotch delicate. These can have the sherry influence that Bushmills has too.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the help all. Some good recommendations. Unfortunately most were unavailable for tasting in the Celtic Whiskey Shop. Going to see about trying a few in the Palace or Brooks over the next while though.<br /><br />I did however end up getting the Arran 14, which hit the spot nicely. Sweet, but not overly sweet, more dried fruit than sweet fresh fruit, and a floral hint. also a hint of honey and beef/steak, but that may be only in my head. Anyway, its delicious, Defo something for after dinner.<br /><br />I also couldnt help myself and also got the Green Spot Chateaux Leoville Barton. I got it as i like Green Spot and i heard this was Green spot but with a littlle more depth and a little edge taken off. Its delicious, but its worlds apart from regular Green Spot, much smoother, much more nuanced. If it wasnt for the bottle you would say its a completely different whiskey, and not a special edition of an established product. Also fantastically delicious!<br /><br />Thats me done buying for a month or two!</div>
