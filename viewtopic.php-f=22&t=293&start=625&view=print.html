So i ensured i opened the package outdoors, and out came the damp cloth to wipe the annoying polystyrene dust (from the cheap polystyrene peanuts they package with) from both the bottles and the boxes -- inside and outside as they stuff more of this contaminant inside of the gift boxes. <br /><br /><br /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7206/6818410510_4ca417764f_z.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

This blend is made with <span style="font-weight: bold">less</span> than 5% grain whiskey the rest is single malt. It was supposed to be a single malt but Colm Egan thought it was missing something and after a bit of experimenting found that a touch of grain made it perfect for him at least. I personally love it but I have heard some dissenters ... but as ever all a matter of taste.</div>
