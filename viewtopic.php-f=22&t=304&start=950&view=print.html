				<div class="content">18 yr old malts - Glenmorangie 18 (Old Label and bottle shape), Tyrconnell 18 (Cask 5289), Bunnahabhainn 18 and Famous Grouse Malt 18 (Vatted Malt).<br /><br />I am afraid to say the Tyrconnell would only be No. 3 in my preferences tonight (Bunna 1, Glenmo 2). Now these can vary depending on my mood.<br /><br />That said, is it just me or does Bourbon cask Tyrconnell peak at around 14/15? Personally, out of the various Single Cask varients I've tried over the years 14 and 15 works best. (The wine finishes are another thing entirely.)</div>

I'm not saying that there was any major fall off either - I just find the 14-15 ones a little spicier (?) maybe. I didn't have a sample of the 17.5 to compare too at the time.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>it is been a black day at the Kilbeggan distillery's history <br />many people been laid off</div></blockquote><br /><br />I'm very disappointed to hear that. I hope those from the old regime who are still working with Beam remember who helped them get to where they are now. <br /><br />I too wish all those who have been forced to leave the company every success in the future. One thing is clear, the room for those distilleries that want to churn out the 'same old-same old' is getting smaller and smaller. Innovation is key now and it's an attribute that those leaving Cooley have in abundance. They will continue to 'distill' success; it's to Beam's misfortune that it won't be for that company.</div>

				<div class="content">Started tonight with a Bruichladdich 17yo Rum Cask - this is the first Laddie I've really liked and I really really do like this one - the Celtic whiskey shop has it at the mo - you really get the rum of the nose - to taste it's a lovely spicy and slightly fruity drink.<br /><br />Now onto a 20yo Authroisk - also very nice. Question now is what to finish on.</div>

				<div class="content">Paid a trip to Tesco today as they are doing a 5 craft beers for a tenner and many of the branches have an excellent choice.<br /><br />Have a dark beer at the minute.<br /><br />Called Moonraker by a UK compamy called JW Lees.<br /><br />Basically tastes like at sweet-ish extra stout and is very tasty indeed.<br />But I felt it needed a whiskey by it's side to enhance it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />Popped into my office and could not decide what to have so decided to maybe &quot;use up&quot; some less favoured whiskey.<br /><br />I picked a Springbank single cask cask strength IB which I was very disappointed with and had found only so so. Decided to put a bit of water through it and I found that it was really improved on what I had previously thought of it. And guess what I have matched a beer and a whiskey perfectly that totally compliment each other. I'd like to think it was total skill on my behalf but a total fluke. <br /><br />Happy days  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'm back to unusual Glenmorangies tonight. I think Glenmo gets overlooked by us whisky snobs sometimes (well by me anyway - no one else need take offence) because it's so popular but, you know, they make some really interesting whisky.<br /><br />Tonight it's;<br /><br />1981 Sauternes Finish (Bott 2002)<br />25yo Malaga Wood<br />1977 - Bott 2003 (Bourbon only I think)<br /><br />I really really love the 1977 - this is my 3rd or 4th bottle of this - it's a lovely subtle but complex highlander. One of my top 5 scotch whiskeys. And that list includes the legendary Laga 21 and Grants Hazelwood 110 so it's in good company.<br /><br />Sooo tempted to open the Glenmo 30 on the shelf but I've had 3 and it's a school night!</div>
