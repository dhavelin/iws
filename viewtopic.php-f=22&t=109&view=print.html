				<div class="content">Lavery's in Belfast.<br />Which is sad, because it's a great pub, which all but sustained Belfast nightlife on its own during the dark days, and they clearly love whiskey because they do stock enough of them (tons of limited edition JDs, full Bushmills range, all main Irish accounted for and a goodly selection of Scotches.)<br />I saw they had a bottle of the Millennium Malt half gone on Saturday evening, and being of a mind to drown my Irish Cup Final sorrows, I asked the price of a dram.<br />Bear in mind, bottles of this whiskey are freely available all over the place for under £100.<br />I was quoted £18.75 a dram!<br />On the plus side, they did balls up the price of the Sazerac Rye and I nabbed a nip for £3.</div>

Compare:<br /><br />€6.40 for a Black Bush in The Fitzwilliam Hotel, Dublin.<br /><br />Normally wouldn't be drinking there but I was early for the CWS tasting and ordered a drink. Ouch.</div>

				<div class="content">Kaixo Chico´s,<br />Pricing Rip Off,,?? its relative... Stock thats sold as standard here in Spain i can and do sell cheaper than back in the &quot;Aul Sod&quot; with your &quot;rip off&quot; spirit taxes..as opposed to here, jameson 2.40 a shot or jameson 12yr 5.00 or Blackbush 3.00 and were talking Spanish measures free pour !!<br />But with special bottles i have to pay heavy transport prices or bottles i buy in Ireland and bring back i have to charge accordingly ie Redbreast 12yr,10.00 a shot etc..<br />Funny thing though,here in Spain the more you charge the more they respect it,guess its also a case of supply &amp; demand etc<br />Same goes for bespoke tasting sesions,,<br />so think who´s ripping off who ,bars,governments, or culture itself,</div>

				<div class="content">You just reminded me of buying whiskey in Irish bars... I was away with the misses lately for a nice long week-end. We stayed in 2 different hotels both 4*.<br /><br />In one I paid 5.50 for a Redbreast 12yo in the other 10.00  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> . <br /><br />My local sells it for 4.50  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />I very rarely drink anything above the standard whiskey's in Irish pubs these as you never know if your going to be ripped off or not. There is no common standard which is just just crazy and then they wonder why people don't go to the pubs.<br /><br />Further what is this thing about charging 3 times the price of the retail price per shot.<br /><br />What I mean by retail price is if a bottle costs 25 quid in the shops and you take 20 shots per bottle (this is very rough so don't pull me up on the ) that works out at 1.25 per shot so the pub price is 3.75. That is fair enough we all can live with that.<br /><br />Now take a 100Euro bottle / 20 shots = 5Euro per shot and that puts the pub price at 15Euro. <br /><br />So for the same barman with the same glass and same work involved there is a grose profit of 2.50 for one pour but 10Euro for the other. Really annoys me that they do it like that. I usderstand that a pub need to probably cj=harge more for having more expensive stock on the premises but they still should have a fairer pricing system and they will sell more. I just can't understand the mentality. Maybe I'm just thick  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>
