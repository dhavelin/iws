				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />    Wow.  I am sorry for any bad feelings that I may have caused here at The Irish Whiskey Society with my post.<br />This was not my intention.  I guess this thread sort of took on a life of it's own.  JC my friend, I hope there are no hard feelings. Tonight, I am just &quot;kicking back&quot; (as all you should) enjoying a BIG dram of &quot;The Irishman&quot;.<br />I am celebrating...errrrr...Tuesday!  Yea, that's it, Tuesday!   BTW JC, you would be proud of me.  This afternoon, I bought myself a bottle of BLACK BUSH (in Maine) despite the fact that it is six dollars less in NH. Why ? Because BLACK BUSH goooood!  Veeeeery gooood!<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   Thank you again Brettie for all your help and support.  Hey, it's all good!  Heck, were all friends here so, let's all have a drink!  Dear God, I am enjoying Irish Whiskey TOO much!  I can't thank all you guys enough for all your help.  Tonight, I had a good size dram of &quot;The Irishman&quot; and now, I'm enjoying a nice dram of BLACK BUSH.  Geeeezeee, both are sooooo good!  I'm really torn about what to buy next to add to my collection.  I'd like to buy another JAMESON 12 to open but, I'd have to travel to NH.  Oooh well, at least I have one bottle of JAMESON 12 stored away for Fall.  So, it's a battle between (the on sale) LAPHROAIG TEN, POWERS 12 or perhaps yet another bottle of BLACK BUSH ?  Oooh, ABERLOUR 12 is on sale, any good ?  I thinks that I am enjoying Irish Whiskey more than Scotch.  However, I've only tried a few Scotch Whiskies.  The Scotch Whisky I've taste so far are&quot;The Famous Grouse Gold Reserve&quot; (blend) TEACHERS HIGHLAND CREAM (INexpensive blend) and TAMDHU 10 (INexpensive SM).  Perhaps I should wait a couple of weeks and put aside my Pennies for a bottle of LAGAVULIN 16 ?<br />Arrrrrr, tough call.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Wbro,<br /><br />   Thank you for your suggestions.  Yea, I'm thinking I should perhaps take a page out of JC's play book and now start collectiong with a mind towards greater quality (vs. quantity) seeing I've put away a decent stash of Whiskies.  That's not to say I am UNhappy with any purchase I've made thus far, including Teachers Highland Cream.   I'm pretty sure I'll go for the Laphroaig ten.  It's kind of crazy for me to drive a two hours round trip (out of my way) paying gas, tolls, etc. trying to save a little money and making only a single purchase at the State of New Hampshire Liquor Store.  I mean, it's one thing if I were heading through NH but, I guess I'll just have to &quot;suck it up&quot; and pay Maine's (outrageous) StateTax.  Truthfully, Laphroaig 10 (being on sale this month in Maine) is priced nearly the same cost as NH's price without tax.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   PD (this is indeed ironic) today, I purchase (in Maine) my first bottle of Kilbeggan Irish Whiskey.<br />I believe Kilbeggan is THE least expensive Irish Whiskey sold in Maine.  That being said, I am now having my first ever dram of Kilbeggan and I agree with you 100%.....Kilbeggan is a FINE tasting Whiskey ESPECIALLY considering it's bargain price ($15.00 and change) for a 750ml bottle.  I am finding Kilbeggan a wee bit hot tasting but, I am rather enjoying it's smooth, sweet taste.  An yes, it is VERY warming!  A bargain to be sure!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Now you guys have me curious about Kilbeggan.  I've seen it in my local liquor store (in Delaware) and so far have not had a desire to try it.  While I am new to the whiskey world, I have found that I haven't liked too many of the Cooley products when compared to Midleton and Bushmills.   <br /><br />PS Powers Gold Label is my current &quot;cheap&quot; favorite, at $22/750ml.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br /><br />      Isn't it interesting that some people (like Brettie) consider Kilbeggan awful (Poison) while others (like myself and Pure Drop and I guess some reviewers) find it quite good and tasty.  I find Kilbeggan (especially considering it's price) one heck of a good buy.  That being said, I guess it's just not for everyone.  I suppose that I should consider myself lucky that I fall into the &quot;LIKE&quot; camp and have found a Whiskey that I truly enjoy that happens to be less expensive than Powers Gold label (which I also like). Another thing, I don't know what it is about Kilbeggan but, I sure seem to get one heck of a buzzzz when drinkng this Whiskey.  IWC, I'm almost positive it was YOU who recommended that I try Kilbeggan so, THANK YOU for that recommendation.  Ooooh, btw, when I first joined this site, I mentioned (in some thread) that I had tried a NIP of Bushmills White Label and how I rather enjoyed the entry level Bushmills.  Ah ha, perhaps this newbie was right after all.  Bushmills White Label IS pretty damn good.  So, I guess I'll have to pick up a bottle of Bushmills White Label on my next visit to NH.  Oooh, speaking of which,  I went to NH today and purchase (yet again) another bottle of JAMESON 12.  I believe I now have four unopened bottles of JAMESON 12.  I just can't resist buying JAMESON 12 in NH as it is $15.00 LESS per bottle than Maine's price.  The NH sales price ($30.99) on JAMESON 12 ends August 10th. so, I'm stocking up on them now!  When money is tight (as it often is) I now have at least three LESS expensive Irish Whiskies to choose from : Kilbeggan, Powers Gold Label and Bushmills White Label and still be a happy camper!  Higher in the pecking order it's JAMESON 12, BLACK BUSH and THE IRISHMAN.  Then of course the next step up for me would have to be REDBREAST.  Hey, I think I'm off to a good start!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

Too bad I'm not headed up to NH until early September (flying into Manchester and then driving to North Conway to climb Mt. Washington).

				<div class="content">Another Kilbeggan hater here, I'm afraid. (Ok, hate's a very strong word... Let's say disliker, if that's a proper word.) Some of Cooley's stuff is genuinely magnificent (love the Tyrconnell finishes, and the older Tyrconnells), and other of their output is clearly admirable whether to one's taste or not (aged Irish grain, all the Connemara range, etc).<br />And towards the cheaper end of the spectrum, which I know the OP likes to consider, I find the Locke's 8 year old to be tremendous value at least in Ireland.<br />But I don't find much to write home about with the basic Kilbeggan. Like IWC, I'd consider White Bush to be a preferable dram in that bracket. Even Paddy has more balance. And it's not a big step up in price to reach a zone of real quality at value prices, where the likes of Powers and Black Bush reside.</div>
