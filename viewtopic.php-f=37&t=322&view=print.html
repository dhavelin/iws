				<div class="content">As we approach the end of our first year, we will be reviewing 2009 and refining/improving things for 2010.<br /><br />I am compiling a list of previously submitted tasting ideas for the committee to discuss, so if anyone would like to add any further suggestions/ideas shout now!<br /><br /><br />Secondly I want to make an appeal, if anyone has bottles they wish to offer for consideration for the society tastings for a price (cost price, fair price or market price) can they please PM me with the list of bottles and what price you would sell them to the society. This will allow us to better plan, build and put together interesting tastings for 2010.<br /><br />Cheers all!</div>

				<div class="content">&quot;What your Da drank&quot; - Sixties, Seventies and earlier bottlings, possibly compared alongside their modern namesakes?<br /><br />That could be a good, relatively inexpensive tasting, especially if we look to go with Sixties versions of Powers, Bushmills, Tullamore Dew, etc. Even an early Jameson wouldn't raise the cost prohibitively. 'Redbreast, Comber or other rarer whiskeys could quickly make it a much less affordable evening, though. I suspect I could near enough supply all the older bottles myself, and likely there are a few other members who could contribute too.<br /><br />I'd be thinking along the lines of White Bush, Bush liqueur (forerunner to Black Bush), Jameson 12 or 15, Powers, Tullamore Dew versus their modern bottlings.</div>
