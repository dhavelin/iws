				<div class="content">A couple of small suggestions for the forum:<br /><br />1) Can it be adjusted where the tasting notes forum is accessible to visitors of the site (i.e. currently if you don't log in, you can't see the tasting notes).  I would hope/think that this would help to promote Irish whiskey by making additional information accessible to more people, while possibly increasing traffic to the forum.<br /><br />2) Under the tasting note headings where each producer has their own sub-forum, is it possible to amend the sub-heading to indicate what labels fall under a particular distillery (i.e. Cooley includes Connemara, Locke's, etc.)<br /><br />Keep up the good work!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Pudge and totally get your points. The committee will probably need to have a think about it. The idea that they were hidden to the casual user was that these would be seen as bonus areas for people who signed up. Further we have not erally given either much attention so they are not populated as much as we'd like so something to work on.<br /><br />Point no 2 is a good one also and I'll try and do something on that soon.<br /><br />Cheers and thanks for the feed back as it is welcome and we always want to try and improve.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi again...another thought, this time along the lines of improving navigation within the forum...<br /><br />The 'Whiskey' forum is a general catchment of whiskey topics.  To improve navigation/accessibility of topics within this forum, could several 'sub-forums' be set up to group similar topics together?  I.e. 'whiskey rumours and news', 'questions about whisky, answered', 'non-Irish whisky discussions', etc.<br /><br />Keep up the great work!</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Pudge for your insights once again<br /><br />yes, we have talked about this before and it has been a serious consideration and we have compared ours to other forums. But as a small volume forum it has been decided to keep it as simple as possible. The pro's of Sub forums as you say is that it can make it easier to navigate to certain types of topics. But this cans also be a negative as you are complicating the process by relying on the user to know where they are going and this is a major problem for infrequent users. We have a lot of infrequent users and that is why it has been decided to have a fairly open &quot;catch all&quot; forum.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the replies, it makes sense.  It's interesting, though, as I'm fairly certain I've had some back and forth with messages that are still in the sent folder.  At least I now know I'm not messing anything up on my end.  Thanks again!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Guys, <br /><br />I have not been able to post photos for a while. I used Paint.net as recommended under tips for years and found it great. I've changed computer and wanted to install Paint.net but it no longer works.<br /><br />I used my iphone on the forum a lot but loading photos seems to be a problem. I'm not computer savvy so if there are easy ways of doing this I would be happy to learn.</div>

I've downloaded it on this computer. I have to figure out how to use the computer now. It's Canadian so the keyboard is a little different to what I'm used too. Can't find a fodda or the euro sign!! My last one was German and I got used to where all the buttons were and it was very entertaining when people would try to use it when I was working in the pub.</div>
