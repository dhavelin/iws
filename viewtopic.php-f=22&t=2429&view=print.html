				<div class="content">I didn't see this in the forum or liquid Irish.  My apologies if this is a duplicate post.  I saw two new Irish brands today.  First up:   Hell-Cat Maggie.  Created by the Wirtz group, a big time Chicago beverage distributor that owns, among other things, the Chicago Blackhawks:  <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.wirtzbev.com/illinois/news/hell-cat-maggie-irish-whiskey">http://www.wirtzbev.com/illinois/news/h ... sh-whiskey</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Weird that Chicago boys named it after some weird New York City reference but that's why they call it the &quot;Second City&quot; I guess.  Retailing around me for about 21 dollars and change.  Label looks cheap, like I could easily peel it off with my fingernail.  Eh, not bad.  Pretty much in line with other blends for this price.  Is this a Cooley?  I thought they weren't doing more of these off label things?  Well the label says cryptically &quot;County Louth&quot;, so that must be it.  Man I can peg these Cooley blends blindfolded.  Pray for me.<br /><br />Yep a bit more googling brought this.  *trigger warning* the slideshow of potential brands might make you weep.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.slideshare.net/vinnyTEP/hellcat-maggie-irish-whiskey">http://www.slideshare.net/vinnyTEP/hell ... sh-whiskey</a><!-- m --><br />Seriously...I guess Irish whiskey has a long way to go in America.<br /><br />Also I saw &quot;Uisce Beatha&quot; brand whiskey.  It was more expensive, at around $30.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.realirishwhiskey.com/">http://www.realirishwhiskey.com/</a><!-- m --><br />Kind of a ballsy name for an upstart brand I'd say.<br /><br />Also also I saw Green Spot for the first time in America.  I've been wanting to try Green Spot for about 8 years.  We have Yellow Spot too.  The Midleton pure pot st - Sorry &quot;Single Pot Stills&quot; are taking up more shelf space and Redbreast is now as expensive as I've ever seen it at near $60 but that Powers is a good deal at under $40 (which is where Redbreast was when I first bought it maybe 7 years ago), next time I get money I might treat myself...<br /><br />Cheers and sorry for the rambling post.</div>

				<div class="content">Good post Mr Booze, good to see ye getting more SPS in the states and yes it is getting real expensive. Even more so in it's home countyry  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />The Uisce Beatha has been released over here too in around the mid â‚¬30's so probably closer to Mid $40's in dollars <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /> . Don't know too much about it but this is the comnpany's website rokdrinks.com/ and the basic but official website <a href="http://www.realirishwhiskey.com/" class="postlink">Realirishwhiskey</a><br /><br />The bottle is supposed to reminisent of the old style bottle but nothing I've ever seen so may be more a US style (I don't know) ?!?!?!?<br /><br />Have not heard of the other one though but it has a nice retro look for me.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing</div>

				<div class="content">A few future whiskeys a to sample. Looking forward to Mucker. <br /><br />I'm a little cautious about the UB whiskey. Is it Cooleys?</div>
