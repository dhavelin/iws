				<div class="content">You mentioned that before and, in fairness, you were right. I'm not sure what you said but i think you were right - on one of my &quot;Black Bush&quot; type experiments the 8yo worked much better than the 15. Which is kind of the same point - the less character the Grain has, sometimes the better. Not to malign grain - a good single grain is a thing to behold but for blending purposes it's not always what you want.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it's because the grain loses its punch as it gets older. <br /><br />I like the Greenore, but find all the vintages quite similar. Not sure I could pick out a favourite. However, the one I tasted at the distillery from the cask was superb. An 18 yr old. Hopefully the one they are bottling will be similar. Tasted very much of bananas.</div>

If it all goes wrong I'll give it your address!<br /><br />No.1 was best. It's sometimes to interesting to mix malts from different groups. They seem to have different approaches to blending. I find I'm really starting to appreciate the elements and how they integrate better now. The percentages are approximate - sometimes I'll add a little more of one thing or other. And I'll always put some aside in a smaller bottle to try a few days later to allow time for the to marry properly.</div>
