				<div class="content">Not a lot in the press so I thought I would post the latest reviews from the BTI in Chicago.  They did a rather large review of Irish Whiskey at the end of May.<br /><br />You can see the complete list at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tastings.com/">http://www.tastings.com/</a><!-- m --> (point out of 100, whiskey name, price, tasting notes, date)<br /> <br />98 • Teeling 21 Year Old Single Malt Vintage Reserve Irish Whiskey $199.99/700 ml. <br />Brushed amber copper color with an olive cast. Layered aromas and flavors of dark raisin toast, honey butter, lightly smoked peat, dried peaches, and leather with a dry-yet-fruity medium-full body and a complex roasted whole nut, dried flower, honeycomb, and delicately smoky mineral accented finish with noticeable wood tannins. A very complex, long-aged Irish whisky for contemplative sipping and cigars. (tasted on May-29-2014)<br /><br />97 • Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve Irish Whiskey $207/700ml. <br />Pale amber color. Complex aromas and flavors of caramelized roasted pecans, honey pastry, dried fruit, suede, brown spices with a supple, dry-yet-fruity and a very long and evolving, complex raisin chutney, passionfruit, creamy vanilla, and pepper accented finish. A superb marriage of grain and oak. (tasted on Jun-01-2014)<br /><br />96 • Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy Irish Whiskey $139/700ml. <br />Golden amber color. Aromas of candied dried apricot, granola, and white blossoms with a silky, fruity-yet-dry medium-to-full body and a round, creme brulee, brown spice, coconut macaroon, and chalk accented finish. A wonderfully balanced and elegant Irish whiskey. (tasted on May-29-2014)<br /><br />96 • Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength Irish Whiskey $72.85/700ml. <br />Golden amber color. Vibrant aromas of honeyed granola and orange gelato with a rich, fruity-yet-dry full body and a long, scintillating finish with a cascade of baking spices, toffee, and minerals. Rounds out beautifully with a little spring water. A superb Irish whisky of the highest order. (tasted on May-29-2014)<br /><br />95 • Bushmills 16 Year Old Single Malt Irish Whiskey $65. <br />Rich amber color. Aromas of salty caramelized roasted nuts, custard, dried tropical fruits, and cocoa with a silky dryish medium-to-full body and a rich melange of dried fruits and berries, dusty grain, gravel, honeycomb, and peppery spices. Impressively rich and satisfying. (tasted on May-31-2011)<br /><br />95 • Redbreast 21 Year Old Irish Whiskey $150/700ml. <br />Golden amber color. Exotic aromas of passionfruit, guava, nettles, chocolate covered pineapple and honey buttered scones with a silky, fruity-yet-dry medium-to-full body and long, resonant ground grain, nougat, dried flower, and green tobacco leaf finish. A complex after dinner Irish whisky and a perfect foil for a milder cigar. (tasted on May-29-2014)<br /><br />94 • Bushmills Rare 21 Year Old Single Malt Irish Whiskey $120. <br />Brilliant amber color. Aromas of banana creme brulee, flower patch, honeyed fig cake, and African spices with a silky, dry-yet-fruity medium-to-full body and a creme Anglaise, orange Pekoe tea, mossy stone, dusty grain, and oak spice finish. A nicely framed oak aged Irish whisky. (tasted on May-31-2011)<br /><br />94 • Knappogue Castle 14 Year Old Single Malt Irish Whiskey $60. <br />Old gold color. Rich aromas of honeyed raisins, blossoms, and buttery fruit custard pastry with a silky, fruity-yet-dry medium-to-full body and a long, grainy, nut, pepper and dried fruit driven finish. A lush, flavorful Irish whiskey that will shine with cigars. (tasted on Jun-01-2014)</div>

				<div class="content">I was reading the RTE news online and read that Diageo sales fell by 9% globally and 4% in Ireland. I feel more price increases. <br />They blame increase in excise duty here. I didn't see them selling Guinness mid strength cheaper than normal Guinness when the excise duty was 40% less. <br /><br />Anyway this was in the article<br /> &quot;Bushmills whiskey brand saw global sales increase by 7% during the year, spurred on by the launch of a new product line as well as its Bushmills Live promotional event.&quot;<br /><br />What new product line?</div>

				<div class="content">There was another bit about Pernod in the Independent today too. It cites Neilson research that say sales are down 6% on trade and 14 % off in the Irish market. Sales of Jameson are up 12% in revenue terms and 9% in volume terms. For me that just indicates that the increase in price has hit the homemarket more that others. They continue to blame the government for the excite duty increases but wont take responsibility for their extortionist price increases. A 70cl bottle of Jameson now cost €30 in most supermarkets and my favorite Redbreast is €65. both are up by nearly 50%. Poor me is drinking The Glenlivit tonight, oh wait who owns..............</div>
