				<div class="content">I got a Bushmill's 16  after tasting some lovely aged Bushmill's recently.<br /><br />I decided to taste it along side the last of my Yellow Spot. I wish I hadn't. It's grand on it own but the Yellow spot just take over the taste buds.<br /><br />I try it again another night on it's own and hopefully I'll enjoy it more.<br /><br />For now I'll say if your in the market for an over €50 under €75 whiskey get your hands on the Yellow Spot while stocks last.<br /><br />I spoke with a Diageo rep today and asked what they were doing with Bushmills. He agreed they were not very innovative. They were willing to try new things with their beers but were very cautious with spirits.

				<div class="content">Last night, some Grand Old Parr 12 in memory and honour of my late grandfather (a Parr himself) who passed away six years ago.  I believe the last alcohol that he had (a couple of years before his passing) was the end of a bottle of GOP 12, shared with my wife and I, that he had been given years previous by a friend.  <br /><br />The GOP 12 is a tough find in North America.  My current bottle is via the friend of a good friend, who kindly brought it up from Texas for my birthday in 2011.  The good friend now lives in California where some BevMo stores have the odd bottle or two.  I hope to always have a bottle in my cabinet, both for sentimental reasons, and for the fact that it is a nice whisky to drink.</div>

				<div class="content">Cracked open bottles of Compass Box Peat Monster (a friend's) and Dun Bheagan Islay 2002 (mine) on Friday night for a peat tasting.  The CBPM is very nicely balanced between the peat and smoke, without either one being overdone...the Caol Ila and Laphroaig that are to my understanding (after reading reviews after tasting this one), components (along with Ardmore, possibly others) of this bottle, were very evident to my friend and myself.  The DB Islay is apparently an 8 yo Lagavulin.  It does seem to have the characteristics of a Laga 16, though with less smoke, less sweetness, and a more prominent role for the peat in an herbal sort of way...a very nice dram for a rainy evening.</div>

				<div class="content">Before going to bed last night, I had a small dram of Black Bush.  This bottle has been open for over 16 months and is approaching 1/4 full.  <br /><br />For the first six to eight months (first 1/2 of the bottle) after opening the bottle, I got a really nice fresh-cut red apple note (more sweet, less tart than a green apple) on the nose and palate.  I haven't experienced that particular note (at least to any noticeable, consistent degree) in any other whisk(e)y that I have tried.  Alas, that note eventually dissipated and for the next several months (the next 1/4 of the bottle level) the BB seemed to emphasize what I assume to be the grain whiskey component to a much greater degree (more bitterness...not unpleasant, but not nearly as enjoyable).<br /><br />Then, all of the sudden, last night when I had a dram the sherry influence came on in spades.  A really rich chocolate fudge note was the predominent feature on the nose and palate.  This was accented by oranges and sweet red berries.  It was my single best dram of BB that I have had, and I now know the basis for one of the most positive reviews that I had read about it last year (on Connosr), which put the BB on my radar of whiskies to purchase.  I had started to slightly waver in my enthusiasm for the BB, and my willingness to re-stock it in my cabinet in the future, but last night was a revelation.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Yesterday at a pub:<br /><br />Leinburn 12 - my most notable experience to date, seemingly, with 'sulphur-taint' as the nose and palate were dominated by a freshly struck matchstick note that made the whisky one dimensional to me.  I have found that I don't usually mind a sulphur style note as part of a more complex profile, but am turned away from a whisky when it is a dominant presence.<br />Macallan 12 - some nice red apple and caramel sauce notes, though with a very striking black pepper note that dominated the nose during the last two sips of the dram.  I confirmed with my wife that no one at the pub had spilled or applied black pepper while eating.<br /><br />at home:<br /><br />HP 12 (previously noted bottle kill) followed by HP 18 from a sample provided by a generous Austrian whisky friend who visited Canada in the summer.  I hadn't had HP 18 in well over a year...I forgot how much I loved it!  Nice sweet citrus (mainly orange) notes on the nose, with a whiff of smoke/peat/candied fruit and a whole bunch of other stuff very nicely balanced on the palate.</div>
