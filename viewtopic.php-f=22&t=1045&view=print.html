				<div class="content">The popularity of whisky is on the rise among women, according to UK supermarket Asda. <br /><br />35% of women now choose whisky over any other alcoholic drink, according to a recent survey conducted by the supermarket. <br /><br />It found that 60% of women questioned saw their interest in whisky begin after developing a taste for it when their husbands kept it about the house.<br /> <br />It also revealed that when it comes to serving, women prefer not to water it down or add a mixer, with 52% choosing to drink it neat.<br /><br />The results suggest that women are unfazed by complexities such as single malts versus blends, and differing cask strengths.<br /> <br />&quot;It's fantastic to see a drink which in the past has been so strongly associated with men, being enjoyed by an entirely new demographic,&quot; said Asda spirits buyer Chris Brooks.<br /> <br />&quot;With 33% of women buying whisky to enjoy at home, and 52% drinking it neat, women are becoming increasingly confident about trying new drinks and are less held back by any old-fashioned stereotypes,&quot; Brooks added.</div>

				<div class="content">Fair enough.<br />I've certainly never met a woman who consistently drinks neat whiskey! I would consider them to be as rare as hen's teeth or a Bushmills PPS. Perhaps it is a British thing? Or even more specifically an ASDA shopper's thing?<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">Ice and a sprinkle of water to relase the angels for me.<br /><br />My family always had whiskey in the house. I tried it, and liked it. I'm not crazy for beer or wine. Except for an occasional Guinness or black &amp; tan, I'll go for Irish or Scotch spirits. <br /><br />I'll drink it neat if it happens to be cold. I prefer a cold drink, and I sometimes put the bottle in the fridge. <br /><br />For those doubters, you just met a woman who drinks whiskey, and sometimes neat.</div>

				<div class="content">That said, it is rare to see a woman drinking whiskey that isn't mixed into some cocktail.<br /><br />But then again, my sweet Moth has tattoos, rides a motorcycle, owns her own business, and is into Wicca. You would expect her to drink whiskey, wouldn't you?<br /><br />Love ya, lil Sis!</div>

				<div class="content">Recently, I heard a radio talk show about this exact subject. For an hour, the hosts talked about women drinking whiskey and asked listeners to call in. Woman after woman called in, every one a whiskey drinker. And a few men calling about their wives and girlfriends who enjoy whiskey. <br /><br />The show hosts made it light and fun, rather than abuse the callers, like many hosts do.</div>
