By the way I'm not questioning the quality of the above just a general statement and the hope that we get brands that are here to stay rather than a cheap nod to the past which eventually fail.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I tried this at WhiskyLive and was very impressed. This would have faired well in the Irish Whiskey Awards.<br /><br />Hopefully they'll drop the other PaddyWackery name.</div>

				<div class="content">The one at the stand @ WhiskyLive was not the one currently on sale<br />but the one for release before Christmas and it certainly was an excellent <br />whisky. He had a mock up of the new label etc.on the bottle. I think the<br />new phrase being used was drip filtered Pot Still ??? Isn't all Pot Still drip<br />filtered come to think of it ??</div>

				<div class="content">That makes sense. I thought it was too good not to have heard about it before. <br /><br />Midleton are still trying to hold their cards close to their chest. We have the new Midleton Peril, 30th Anniversary and the excellent cask mate jameson. They still haven't released a new Single Pot Still. I could tell from their reaction that a new Spot is on the way. They were uncomfortable with my enquiries. <br /><br />I asked at the Mitchells stand about a new spot but sadly they didn't know what I was talking about. Either they were just there for show or they were good poker players but I couldn't get a read. Sadly Peter Dunne wasn't there this year or at least I didn't see him.</div>

				<div class="content">Apart from Midleton Peril and the beautiful Jameson caskmates, has there been any other new whiskeys from the Midleton distillery? I thought they had a plan to release 3 new Pot Stills every year?<br />We expected a new Spot, and I still expect it any day, but there's no sign of anything else.</div>
