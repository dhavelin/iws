I can get JJ18 for €90 &amp; JJGold for €54 at the moment...<br /><br />Where did you see that price... and is it a new batch or what...<br /><br />At this stage I'm totally confused... is it (A) another previously bottled tranche of the 2005 bottling (B) a fresh bottling of the same batch/vatting or (C) a completely new 2009 bottling...<br /><br />At this stage my curiousity is limited to trying it side-by-side with the 2005 bottling... can't see myself buying it on a regular basis... and those who know me... I buy a lot... so this pricing level won't reach it's target audience... at least not in this country... <br /><br />And this at a time when the majority of the populations disposable income is down at least 15-20%, it does not make economic sense, marketing sense and could fail to attract a new generation of PPS fans... pity!!!</div>

				<div class="content">The price point is very dissappointing? For a 15yo Whiskey it is way over priced and cannot be sold at limited edition prices. That's even above the price point of a scotch single cask at a similar age.<br /><br />Not a happy camper but not surprised  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" />  <br /><br />The Irish Whiskey market continues to be abused by the industry and they will never get the regular whiskey drinker to move beyond standard expressions if this is their attitude to pricing.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /></div>

				<div class="content">Usually I don't have problems with dusty notes in whisk(e)y, it's something that adds depth and character. In this case, the new version is perfectly fine, but once you place it next to the old version, it's night and day in terms of freshness and fruitiness. I just think people who adored the previous version may not be impressed with the new one.</div>

				<div class="content">I tasted the 2 together over the weekend and completely agree with the analysis above. The newer bottling seems more old fashioned, maybe closer in style to the Jameson 15 - the musty, dusty thing people talk about. It's a fine drink ut the previous version slightly shades it for me so far. That said, my opinion can change on these things over time - I know and love the older version so I would very much have been basing my opinion of the new one on that.<br /><br />At least we know for certain now that it is a different batch.</div>
