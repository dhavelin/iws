				<div class="content">Yes, should be fine as long as the fill level is good. Should be in the neck somewhere above the shoulder level. <br /><br />1984 is the very first release of the Midleton Very Rare annual release. In saying that it is also one of the most available of the 80's releases.<br /><br />Guess any where between â‚¬400-600 to someone on here if you can find a buyer.</div>

				<div class="content">Agree with IWC. Lots of them still around. Another option is put it on auction. Some of the British sites are getting amazing prices. <br />The consideration is sellers commission and postage to the auction. I know Whiskyauctioneer.com are charging 5% to sell and that's not bad. <br />You could sell privately too of course. There are online sites you could use too. Some don't allow you to sell alcohol but may let you put the ad up but will take it down after, no refund either.</div>
