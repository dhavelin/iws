				<div class="content">Good point but if you are a collector then the 2009 is a choke point that <br />would make it very hard to link up anything pre 2009 withe the 2010. At the<br />time it was launched off licences were given out a max. of two I believe and<br />it would be probably safe to conclude that being near Christmas a lot of them <br />were drank. It was not advertised at the time that there were two vintages in <br />the same year. Safe to say that even the fledgling IWS missed that one at the<br />time ( tongue in cheek comment I might add ) <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>

Do you have the Distillery Horse too?</div>

				<div class="content">Scottish Whisky Auctions had a few Irish Whiskeys. <br /><br />I'm only mentioning 6 but there were a few others. Prices weren't remarkable so I didn't record them. I'm not saying these are remarkable prices either. I really wish they would make their site easier to use. It's going for 5 years now and still as difficult to use. If you use #Irish Whiskey as a search you'll find lots of lowland whiskeys but may not include some actual Irish Whiskeys.<br /><br />Bushmills 21 Year old - 60(67.50)<br /><br />Bushmills 400 Anniversary - 50(56.00)<br /><br />Knappogue Castle 1995 - 75(84.00)<br /><br />Midleton Dair Ghealach Tree 9 - 145(162.40)<br /><br />Redbreast Cask Strength B1/12 - 60(67.50)<br /><br />All prices are Sterling And Commission is 10% + VAT</div>

				<div class="content">Just read that a bottle of 100 yr. old Irish whiskey<br />sold for a whopping 15,000 euros @ Whytes in Dublin<br />last week. Looked it up in their catalogue. it was a Dublin<br />Whiskey Distillery bottle. Picture online (lot 296). In the<br />Picture it did not even look sealed -- no foil capsule etc.<br />Amazing price but it was a '1916' auction !!</div>

				<div class="content">Yes truely amazing all right and I believe a record for any Irish Whiskey.<br /><br />I also believe this price is more down to 1916 memorabilia rather than Irish Whiskey collecting. Brilliant no matter which way you look at it though.<br />An original copy of the Proclaimation went for an eye watering  â‚¬185,000.00.<br />Even some medals were going for thousands rather than hundreds. <br /><br />The Whiskey was from DWD and distilled in 1916 and reckoned to be bottled in 1966 so a 50year old. I wonder how good it is (if it is intact!)<br /><br />However I'd have serious reservations on the cork never mind it missing the seal. Just does not look right but who knows it does look like it has been in the bottle for a few years at the same time????? Even if the cork was replaced on the original contents it is probably now suffering serious oxidisation. Anyway I am sure it is going somewhere it will be appreciated for what it is.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.whytes.ie/images/20160313/296_1.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
