				<div class="content">Bunahabhain 18yo ...<br /><br />This is more sherried than I remembered it but certainly not overly sherried at the same time.<br /><br />Lovely zing to this whiskey and a very gentle Islay. Lovely bit of spice &amp; light pepper with the sherry sweetness.<br /><br />Superb whiskey and possibly a totally under rated whiskey.<br /><br />I'm not sure about the 12yo Bunny still but the 18yo is a classic  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Yesterday I opened a newly acquired bottle of Hazelwood 110, the limited edition blend from all of Grants distilleries. (It was a birthday present.) Only had time for a small sample but my honest first impression is that is one of the finest whiskies I've vere tasted. Probably the best Scottish blend I've tried. Lovely combination of Chrismas cake and hney and surprisingly easy to drink at 55%. WOW! <br /><br />I think there's about 1600 bottles given to Grants employees - my suggestion to them is don't sell it on ebay - drink the thing! It's worth it. (I admit that's not helpful to non Grants employees, and in fairness if no one ever sold theirs I wouldn't have got a bottle!)</div>
