				<div class="content">The Whiskeys of Ireland by Peter Mulryan would not be a bad place to start. Very concise and still fairly up to date.<br /><br />See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whiskeys-Ireland-Peter-Mulryan/dp/0862787513/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288876756&amp;sr=8-2" class="postlink">HERE</a><br /><br />Product Description<br /><br />The History of Irish Whiskey<br />There is a direct correlation between the history of distilling in Ireland and the history of the island itself. It's as if whiskey were the lifeblood of the people.<br /><br />The Rise and Fall<br />Did you know that a hundred years ago Irish Whiskey was so prized, that Scottish distillers often shipped their whiskey to Dublin? Here it was mixed with minute quantities of Irish, re-exported as 'Irish Whiskey and sold at a premium!<br /><br />The Fall and Rise<br />The Irish distillers reacted to the threat of blended Scotch in just the way you would imagine; they fought amongst themselves to the edge of extinction ... but ... today Irish Whiskey is the fastest-growing brand in the world. This year alone seven new brands were launched internationally.<br /><br />How Whiskey is Made<br />Understand the difference between Single Malts, Blends, Pot-still whiskeys; and the art of distilling and blending.<br /><br />Tasting Whiskey<br />How to explore the different flavours found in Irish Whiskey and where they come from. Learn how to taste as well as drink!<br /><br />This beautifully produced book, with full-colour photographs throughout, will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Irish whiskey.</div>

Is another ... a bit older but more detailed and good for history etc. However it is being sold on AMazon second hand and the prioces are a bit OTT. Probably be able to get it for well under 20Euro in Europe if you can find somewhere that will post to you.</div>
