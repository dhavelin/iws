				<div class="content">The Whisky Live website says the events in China in 2014 are postponed to 2015, and yet there is a Whisky L! event in the same venues in Shanghai &amp; Beijing.  Strange.<br /><br />Anyway, my point is that that it is a shame that again this year it looks like zero representation from any Irish Whiskey at the event.  There is a wide range of Scotch from the different areas, a significant number of US bourbons and some Japanese single malts.  Pernod Ricard, Diageo and Suntory Beam are all well represented, so I had hoped they might stick a few bottles of Irish into their suitcase for the event as well, but it looks like a potentially huge market will remain still largely unaware of Irish Whiskey.  <br /><br />Many bars have the obligatory Jameson, and while it is a good Whiskey, there is such an increasing range of styles available, its a pity none of them are getting represented.</div>
