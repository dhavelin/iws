				<div class="content">I was lucky enough to be at the Irish launch event of this title by Ian Buxton last night. The guide is a very well-written, fun and consise tome outling some of the world's more accessible whiskeys that aficionados should endeavour to seek out and is unencumbered by the more marketing-orientated descriptors that often plague the smaller print in such texts.<br /><br />The event was kindly hosted by Mitchell &amp; Son Fine Wine and Spirit Merchants - and home of the legendary Green Spot whiskey of course! From speaking with many of the attendees it was clear that a great evening was had by all and given the general hospitality, the fine food and fantastic whiskeys on offer I'm sure the next event will be eagerly anticipated! (Get writing Ian! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> )<br /><br />As a side bar, I <span style="font-weight: bold">definitely</span> have a new favourite whiskey - Greenspot 12yo, so any of you with a half bottle or so that you're not going to finish just pm me and I'll send you my postal address <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Has anyone else read the book yet?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">Have to agree with John in regards to the style of this book and he has summed up the flavour of this book nicely.<br /><br />While I have been going through this book I have come to the conclusion that it is one of the best whisk(e)y reference books that has appeared on our book shop shelves in a long time. A lot has been made of the controversial Whisky bible and whether you like it or not the WB is actually not very helpful if you don't know what you like or even if you don't have experience of a particular distillery. However this is where the 101 is so different, what it does is tells you what brands are worth exploring and then from there you can expand on partuicular brands or styles if the fancy takes you. From Ian Buxton's years of experience and topping that off with the knowledge of industry insiders that he has gotten to know over his many years he has been able to compile a managable list of must try whiskies. <br /><br />What I like about this book is that it covers a wonderfully diverse spectrum of whiskies ... Scotch, American, Japanese and of course Irish as well as a few others. And what it does is challange you to explore a multitude of differnet style whiskies. In a word this is possibly the best educational tool one could have. I personally have tasteed 46 of the whiskies in this book and I reckon of those 46 only 2 have not suited my palate. What this says to me is what other gems have I missed in the other 55 !!! It definately is an encentive to do further exploring. <br /><br />There may only be 4 Irish entrys but let that not taint your reason for buying this book because on reflection that is a more than a worthy representation of Irish Whiskies in the world scheme of things. If your looking to further your palate and experience in whisk(e)y this is an excellent book to show you the way. Well woth having in your Library if you ask me.</div>

So no I will not be falling into that trap ... but I will get through a fair few of them though  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
