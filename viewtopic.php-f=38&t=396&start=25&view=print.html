				<div class="content">Great site - perhaps a little bit busy though. One thing that really caught my eye (and fair play to them) is their 10% price reduction for all items manufactured in Ireland. Fantastic to see that someone is taking the lead on this and I hope they benefit from it. As an example, for those interested in getting in a bit of 'practice' before the March 25th tasting ( <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) the promotion brings the price of Midleton VR down to â‚¬130.<br />Cheers,<br />John.</div>
