It shows without doubt the off licence is where the whiskey drinker gets value for money. The vintners must think average Irish person is very ignorant when it comes  to whiskey. It's not just an Irish thing when I was in Reading last year, I asked how much for a glass of midelton very rare, my jaw dropped when he said £25. The vintners basically run a monopoly, compared to the competition in the retail sector. I can see Paddy hitting new lows of €15 a bottle<br />from €25 a few years back.<br /><br />But as a fella on this forum has said, they would't be charging the price if they were not getting the business!</div>

Not sure I follow.<br /><br />My benchmark is €3.80 for the basic whiskeys. How much above that is my &quot;rip-off index&quot;. I figure there should be a base charge for every drink, alcoholic or not, which is your sitting down and getting served charge. The rest of the price should be the cost of the drink to the bar. Should be able to serve a Midleton for €10 or so by that reckoning.</div>

Deregulation of the pub trade should be done IMHO but not in a taxi way.<br /><br />I'm not anti vintner, they play very big roles in the community. I'm off to my own bar to sip on a blackbush!

				<div class="content">I apply the x 10 rule as follows, lets say the RRP of a bottle of Jameson Gold is €75, my expectation would be that a glass would be priced around €7.50, based on 20 measures per bottle this gives the pub retailer a mark-up of 100% (e.g. €7.50 x 20 = €150 turnover - €75 cost = €75 markup)<br /><br />Of course whether the mark-up covers the individual pubs overheads (which are many) giving him a reasonable profit I coudn't really say?<br /><br />Any thoughts...</div>

				<div class="content">I'm with Michael on this, the overheads bars are expected to pay at the moment is crazy. Just spotted a grease tax recently which specifies if you sell food, even sandwiches alone you must pay nearly a 300 euro tax. I'd have no problem paying that if it was monitored, i.e. small premises pay less than the huge hotel sellling thousands of meals a week. I know I know.... violin.<br /><br />But it's not just the Vintners who are over charging, had a kings of leon tribute band come into the bar last week to talk about doing a gig, all was going well til the price came up...... 2,500 euro for a 2 hour set.... for a tribute band. That's extreme yes, but all entertainment in bars need to be covered, if you have a radio on in the background it's around 400 euro you have to pay to IMRO. Sky sports is ridiculous to, calculated on a combination of your postcode,maxiumum occupancy<br />and annual turnover.<br /><br />Pubs can't compete with the likes of Tesco, nobody can, there's a reason so many city centre pubs are lying idle and it's nothing to do with pricing themselves out of the market it's to do with the overheads they're up against. <br /><br />Go into Michael's and you'll get a huge selection of whiskeys that only one or two off licenses in the country can offer you. He and his staff can reccommend and educate you on your selection (and offer promotions) and you can have a fine selection of beers and food to accompany it. I tracked down 2 bottles of Killbeggan 15 year old  to an O'Briens a month ago, while in there I asked about 4 other whiskeys and got the same information about each bottle... &quot;very smooth&quot; that was the height of their knowledge. <br /><br />If you have a premium bottle of whiskey behind the bar odds are it's gonna be there longer than a standard bottle and needs to be insured for the duration of it's stay. As I said earlier in this thread the prices on that menu are ridiculous but it's not as easy as covering your costs so people might come back and finish the bottle, it kind of defeats the purpose of being in business.<br /><br />Rant over!  To summarise over pricing= bad, reasonable pricing= good, off license pricing in pub= not viable</div>
