I'm also new here!<br />I started getting interested in whiskey when I visited a local whiskey fair where I was able to taste some whiskeys and I realized there is a different in taste. I got fascinated and finally I'm here <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />And it's a big wish of mine to visit a distillery!

				<div class="content">I'm Tom and I live in Manchester. I may be of Welsh and Irish (Corcoran) ancestry, but I am English. My knowledge of Scotch whisky is OK. My favourites are Caol Ila 12 - Lagavulin - and Ardbeg Corryvreckan. I knew nothing at all about Irish whiskey. It just never entered my consciousness. <br /><br />I was in Asda a while back and saw a special offer, Bushmills and Tullamore Dew for £10 a bottle. I thought 'what the hell'. The Tullamore was far too thin for me, but I liked the Bushmills. No depth, but there were, at least, hints of something better. Even at regular price (£17) it was far superior to any household name brands of blended Scotch which sell by the lorryload. Those things put me off drinking whisky for the best part of a decade. I thought all whiskies tasted like petrol. If I'd started off with an Irish whiskey, I might not have had that lost decade.<br /><br />I came here because I don't know where to move up from the Bushmills and I'm eager to learn. I was fascinated by the history. I had no idea that Irish whiskey was long considered far superior to Scotch and no idea that it disappeared from British/Empire/World markets so very suddenly - allowing the Scots to happily fill the void.<br /><br />My budget tends to run to a maximum of around £75 for rare treats or £20-£30 for day-to-day drinking. I can't stand mixers and I don't use water or ice either. I like my whisky, armagnac and rum, straight. If anyone knows a good, not too 'head-up-the-a*se' shop with a decent range of Irish whiskey in South Manchester, I'd be grateful to hear about it.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Tom. Yuo will get plenty of info here for all sorts of differing tastes.<br />My personell taste is for sweeter whiskies, Bushmills 12YO, only available <br />from the  distillery or ebay. Another favourate of mine is Jameson Redbreast<br />which you should be able to buy at Tesco/Asda for about £28.<br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />TallyB</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Tom! We don't have it in Ireland, but Sainsbury's Dun Leire gets good reviews. It's a blend from the Cooley Distillery, which is the one you haven't tried (ie you had Bushmills from Bushmills and Tullamore Dew from Midleton).<br /><br />For trading up to something a bit special but still a very reasonable price, I suggest Writers Tears.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the info. I had a look on the supermarket sites. Glad I did. <br /><br />Jameson's Redbreast - couldn't find it. Tesco have Jameson's 12 for £23. Asda only appear to do the standard Jameson's blend at £15. Sainsbury's URLs didn't resolve for some reason. So I took screenshots. The Dun Leire? This one? <br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/440/screenhunter01nov202301.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/5956/screenhunter01nov202301.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />It's only £15!<br /><br />Also: Bushmills 10 year old for £23.91 and Bushmills Blackbush for £22.79. Worth a go?<br /><br />The supermarket choice is dire. I need to spend a while looking through the rest of this site, make some choices and then go find a decent independent shop.<br /><br />Edit....looks like TheWhiskeyBro has answered the question about the Dun Leire. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

Since you are enjoying the Writers Tears, I think it's worth mentioning you can raise the Irish, earthy pot still character another notch with Powers John's Lane Release. It's a little more expensive but still very good value so perhaps keep it in mind for future consideration.</div>

				<div class="content">DavidH...The Dun Leire. 3 cases came in to my nearest big Sainsbury's. That's, what, 18 bottles (six to a case)? I got the last two. Very nicely boxed too. Obviously very, very, popular. I had a small sample just after I got home. I'm a bit lost here. I wasn't expecting what I got. There's smoky coal tar in smell and taste (one reason I love Islay whiskies) that gives way to booze-soaked christmas cake then lots of fruit notes, not all of them sweet. Nice peppery/fizzy finish. This is the best £30 I've spent in ages. <br /><br />One major caveat. I drank far too much of the WT on Monday night and, for most of yesterday, felt like my head was on sideways. So, right now, I may not have tastebuds I can fully trust. I'll have another go after I've recovered my senses. If I am just as pleased, or even more pleased, I'll order a case for Christmas/New Year before the offer expires on Dec 6.<br /><br />Thanks again for all the help. Very glad I came here.  <br /><br /><br />Tom<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Edited post (Nov 29)</span> - the 'head on sideways' feeling was nothing to do with having had too much of the Writers Tears (I want to put an apostrophe in there somewhere). It was a sign I'd caught whatever bug was doing the rounds. It has been an interesting week but not one I'd wish on anyone else.</div>
