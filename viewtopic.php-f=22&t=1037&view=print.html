				<div class="content">We'll have to say it to Ally in the Celtic Whiskey Shop to see if he can source some,<br /><br />I wonder if it is a Bushmills or a Cooley, <br /><br />The first Bushmills released was the KC '93 vintage and the Master Distillers Collectors Edition was a '94 (b. 2009)<br /><br />However the KC 15yo was a Cooley (vatting of a 1990,91,92), the last Cooley vintage release was the KC '92.<br /><br />I reckon based on the year it is the former, good to see Bushmills doing a sherry finish if I am correct.</div>

				<div class="content">Very reasonable price considering it it minimum $89.99 in the states.<br /><br />It's a 700ml version too so possibly not the same batch as the one for the states.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi.  New here, first post.<br /><br />Has anyone tried this 16yo Knappogue Castle &quot;Twin Wood&quot; and could provide a good description?  I work at a liquore store here in Peabody, Massachusetts, and we have two bottles -- not enough to try, and it seems to be rare enough that we can't find anyone who has tried it.  Hard to have an educated conversation with a customer without ever having tasted the stuff.  Any information will be very helpful.  Thanks in advance!</div>

Even though this has been available in the states for some time now the distributor here in Ireland literally only taken receipt of it. I only got my bottle this week and unfortunately we are in the middle of a serious whiskey week and I'm not even contemplating opening mine until Whisky Live Dublin is finished today week and I would imagine even at that I'll be giving whiskey a rest for a while.<br /><br />I'm sure someone will get around to it soon enough though.<br /><br />However What Does John Know has some very basic information on it. <a href="http://www.whatdoesjohnknow.com/2011/04/22/two-irish-whiskey-brands-at-the-top-of-their-game/" class="postlink">Click Here</a><br /><br />By the way welcome, thanks for signing up and contributing and you are to be congratulated on trying to educate yourself to try and impart that knowledge on to your customers.</div>

I read the review from a few websites, including &quot;What Does John Know,&quot; but I like to find out what &quot;real&quot; people think of an item.<br /><br />I will keep checking back here -- seems like a great forum, and Irish Whiskey's are becoming more and more popular here in Eastern Massachusetts.</div>
