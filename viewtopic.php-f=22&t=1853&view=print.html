				<div class="content">Hi All,<br />I'm looking to track down and purchase any remaining bottle of MULLIGAN WHISKEY LIQUEUR that might be out there, as a gift for my boyfriend's 40th birthday. He tasted it some time ago in O'Loughlin's pub in Ballyvaughan and has been raving about it ever since, but when we went back there recently they said they had finished their last bottle of it and believed it was out of production.  From internet searches I thought it was 'Mulligan Scotch Whisky' but the Celtic Whiskey Shop on Dawson St in Dublin said it was Irish, produced by Irish Distillers originally but they stopped doing it and it hasn't been bought over by another brand.  <br /><br />I'm hoping someone on this forum may be able to point me in the direction of a last, stray bottle that hasn't been opened and that I might purchase as a special 40th birthday gift! Anyone have any ideas re. shops that may still have it in stock?  (Internet searches are proving tricky as L Mulligan Grocer's keeps coming up instead!)<br />Many thanks in advance.</div>

				<div class="content">IrishWhiskeyChaser thank you so much for this detailed response!<br />I now have a photo which will greatly help my search, and I will take your advice re. Ebay. <br />Will also look into Dubliner and Bushmills Honey whiskey liqueurs as alternatives. <br />We did try some Glayva <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-5237.aspx">http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-5237.aspx</a><!-- m --> but it was that bit too sweet for his liking.<br /><br />Many thanks indeed for your help.<br /><br />ps - If any of the forum members have a bottle of Mulligan's tucked away that they'd be willing to offload, do let me know!</div>

I was there a couple of years ago and they had Dublin Dry gin too. It's strange to see those after they've been delisted for so many years.</div>

				<div class="content">A bit late I know, maybe a possible bottle for his 45th Birthday,  but currently have a single bottle of Mulligan Irish Liqueur, I guestimate to be an early 80s bottling. It is on my website <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.charterhousewine.co.uk">www.charterhousewine.co.uk</a><!-- w --><br /><br />I also turn up a few old bottlings of Irish Mist, Paddy, Tullamore, John Power but you need to be quick or let me know your interest as many of my finding go to Canada and the States.<br /><br />As far as the Mulligan is concerned - a bottling by Irish Distillers for Mulligan and Co...if I don't sell it I'll probably drink it with one or two of my Irish chums, when I'm next in Dublin !
