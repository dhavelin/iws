Just need to keep the fingers, toes and everything else crossed on this one.<br /><br />A Tullamore Distillery will have a double positive effect on the Irish whiskey industry. Another distillery in Ireland is the obvious one. But in the future years IDL will be free to do what they will with the capacity that they now pump into Tullamore. So I cannot see it being a negative for IDL either.</div>

				<div class="content">There is something about the name that just makes me not want to buy it even though I'm happpy to buy the oddly named Redbreast and Greenspot. I can't say I ever seen anyone buy it or heard of anyone drinking it except as a &quot;Double Dew&quot; which is a noxious mix of Mountain and Tullamore Dew. I wonder how this big marketing blitz will play on the US.</div>

				<div class="content">brilliant news! I've been waiting to hear something like this since their acquisition by Grants. I actually cant stand the Tullamore Dew blend available right now (there's this strange juiced metal metallic taste to it that i just cant get away from. I dont know what it is but i never get it from other IDL blends like Powers Jameson etc) That being said i'd leap at the prospect of a revived Tullamore distillery. I think i asked this once before but does anyone know if they're stiking with a malt/malt based blend portfolio or if they intend to return the brand to its B. Daly's SPS origins or both or what?</div>

				<div class="content">If I was a betting man I say the distillery will be built in Tullamore rather than Clonmel, they are re developing the visitors centre at the moment. Big fan of the Tullamore dew 12 year old just hard to find when you want it IWS is the only place that stocks it. Talking to the self stacker in my local Dunnes he cant keep Tullamore dew on the self @ €15 a bottle sold over 75 bottles already out selling Bushmills white at the same price with Jameson coming in a surprising third, over half the customers would be Polish/Russian.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd put in my bets with Gus too-- the tullamore site has a heritage of location and an existing visitors centre to drum up for the tourists. I'd expect them to put it back there, bottling plant or no bottling plant.</div>
