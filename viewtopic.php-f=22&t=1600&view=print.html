Yes you can pay at the door but I don't think they encourage it.<br /><br />Pre booked tickets are bought on line and then you just register on the day. You just give your name and they check it against their list. I know in whisky live London I had to print off my receipt but wl Dublin it was just turn up at the door and give name.</div>
