				<div class="content">Now that you mention peg in that light a few brain cells have been awakened.<br /><br />Being a sucker for the Antiques shows (Antiques Road show, Bargin Hunt, Flog it ... etc) I've amassed a lot of inadequate information about antiques. Your recount of Peg has reminded me of such measuring vessel.<br /><br />However it was a 17th century Silver drinking tankard and had 5 or 6 &quot;pegs&quot; down the inside. The idea was that pegs were placed at equal distances, to determine each man's portion. And probably came from the Saxon ritual of handing around the Wassail Bowl at feasts ... so that is Peg out the door for us  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

Well, not particularly on my side. I just can't help saying the word &quot;dram&quot; with a Scottish accent (and prefixing it in my mind with &quot;wee&quot;) so I was looking for another word with the same meaning but more neutral associations.<br /><br />The word &quot;dram&quot;, by the way, derives from Greek. I'll happily take a word of any origin: Latin, Saxon, Scandinavian, Irish... It's all part of the richness of language.</div>

It held two quarts, (and was a noble piece of plate) so that there was a gill of ale, half a pint Winchester measure, between each peg. The law was, that every person that drank was to empty the space between pin and pin, so that the pins were so many measures to make the company all drink alike, and to swallow the same quantity of liquor. This was a contrivance for merriment, and at the same time a pretty sure method of making all the company drunk, especially if it be considered that the rule was, that whoever drank short of his pin, or beyond it, was obliged to drink again, and even as deep as to the next pin.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The word 'compotation' was new to me so I looked that up: &quot;The act of drinking or tippling together&quot;.

				<div class="content">Simplicity is the hallmark of genius. A new contender has to be weighed in for this debate. A term that, perhaps because we were too familiar with it, was never considered! <br /><br />I am of course talking about the all singing, all dancing 'sup' of whiskey. There you go lads and lassies; 'I'll have a sup of whiskey please barman', or, 'I'll have a sup of Tyrconnell please barman' (just to demonstrate its' versatility!).<br /><br />Now for the proverbial 'double' I'm running into trouble (double trouble?!) - do you ask for a 'double sup' or a 'large sup'?

				<div class="content">Kaixo guys,<br />I like the generic Gaelic term Boll O Malt which i believe was an accountable term for the spirit ie x amount of Bolls o' Malt etc..I also came accross the term in an Irish novel refered to as Taylors of Malt,my own coined phrase is Legs and Lacing..very un PC the Legs refer to the dribbles in a whiskey snifter glass and the lacing is of course the rings of foam head left on the pint glass of Stout,as historically drank fado fado.....<br />another un PC term is two fingers or a finger..best i dont explain.....<br />Here in Euskadi or the Basque Country as opposed to the rest of Spain who all drink a lot of whiskey...the Basques like after dinner an Expresso with a shot of whiskey..let me explain..the shot glass is pre frozen and i pour chilled Jameson..this they call a Chupito..interestingly now the Scots have the Snow Grouse..i feel a new coined phrase comming on..how about Shakeltons malt or Breens sip..after the question as to how do South Pole exporers like their whiskey..answer COOOOOLD.....shiver me timbers...<br />But Boll O Malt or even Dram in these marketing modern and contempary times are outdated,,lets go for a shot ie for a single or a double for a double ..any way isnt that why the marketing gurus and spin doctors get pain the big bucks!!!...best they get on with it and earn their shillings....Slain.</div>
