				<div class="content">A late posting but...last weekend my friend and I cracked open my bottle of Writer's Tears, which my very awesome wife gave to me for Christmas.  It blew both of us away with a good deal of complexity in the aroma/flavour profile (among other things, I again picked up a variation on the 'cotton candy' note that I have found in some other Irish whiskies, like Jameson Gold), which was coupled with a smooth delivery that had little to no alcohol bite.  We each had two sizeable pours during the evening, with the realization that if we had started earlier in the day, I would have likely had to post this in the 'what bottle did you finish' thread, instead.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />My friend's whisk(e)y budget is larger than mine, and I suspect he will make a sizeable dent in our city's supply of this bottle since it is a great (by Ontario standards at least) value bottle at Can$48.  I may purchase one or two bottles from his stash, down the road, as funds permit.  Very enjoyable stuff!<br /><br />Edit to add: a very creamy profile balanced out by grain/mineral notes that I assume (rightly, I hope...please do correct/elaborate on what makes up the traditional 'pot still profile') are part of the pot still portion of this blend.</div>

				<div class="content">Last night, I had a small pour of Redbreast 12.  I am now wondering if I am not as much of a fan of pot still whiskey as I thought (I'm also wondering if it was just an 'off' night).  <br /><br />For context, I have really enjoyed my Writers Tears so far (which I believe is a blend of malt and pot still whiskey.  I find a nice creamy element that contrasts, but works nicely with, the 'grainy' nature of the pot still while also lightening/brightening the overall profile of the pour.  <br /><br />The Redbreast I had last night I found to have a musty, grainy, though well rounded, profile.  Unfortunately, it struck me as being rather one dimensional.  Has anybody else found this, at least on occasion.  I have really enjoyed it in the past, but last night left me cold.  I truly hope it was an 'off night' for tasting/nosing.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the feedback guys!   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />  Alas, the Yellow Spot and PJL have eluded the grasp of the purchasers at the LCBO.  The PJL has been heartily recommended so I will certainly make it one of my three purchases in Ireland when my wife and I can figure out the finances (having to purchase a car sooner than anticipated has thrown a wrench into our original plans of crossing the pond this year).<br /><br />Another thought crossed my mind when Joel mentioned batch variation...what is Redbreast's 'sustainability' as an open bottle like?  My bottle is approaching one year being open and I know that whiskies in general can have quite a variation in their abilities to retain their original profile once the bottle has been cracked open.</div>

				<div class="content">Haven't had RB 12 since my last post, but I did try Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask for the first (and last) time yesterday.  This is the third rum cask finished whisky that I have had and...no, the concept does not work for me.  The nose was very nice with sweet raisins, and some other fruit notes, but I found the palate and finish to be spirity.  In general, it seemed to me like the rum cask finish overpowered the malt.  Imho, any distillers looking to experiment in the future should tread carefully...the malt needs to be strong enough to not be dominated by the rum spirit.</div>

				<div class="content">Technically, we are not allowed to have any alcohol while deployed. Lucky for me, I have some very generous friends back home that dont mind bending a rule or two. <br /><br />Bushmills Original - I dont think I've ever spent so much time tasting and truly enjoying this whiskey. After almost 9 months with out my beloved whiskies, I savored that first pour like it was going to be my last. I may have had to cut a water bottle in half to use for a cup, and I may kept a hand securely over the top of said water bottle cup to keep the constant dust from infiltrating the liquid gold I had acquired, but hot damn! was it one hell of a dram. <br /><br />The nose caught me off guard at first. I havent bothered to really smell anything in quite a while. Light and sweet with some peppery spice at first but as it opened up, I noticed a lot more vanilla than I have before. The honey was there as always but a little more sweet.<br /><br />The first taste or two I dont remember thinking anything. Im pretty sure I was just enjoying the moment too much to think. light and warm, good mouth feel. Honey and with a little bit of vanilla. Noticed more fruit than I have in the past? couldnt quite say what that? an orchard fruit? maybe apples? it was nice either way. some toffee as well, but less than I remember which was slightly dissapointing ( I immediately, after that thought, realized how truly fortunate I was to be enjoying &quot;less toffee&quot; and decided I was no longer dissapointed).<br /><br />Finished as I have always remebered and enjoyed. bits of vanilla with that peppery spice fading crisp and clean.<br /><br /><br />All things considered? One of my all time favorite whiskey moments. Sadly, I dont think the original will ever taste that amazing to me again. I still have a bit left, Ill take pictures of my next &quot;tasting&quot; and post them soon.</div>
