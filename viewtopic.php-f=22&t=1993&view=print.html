				<div class="content">Hi to all of you<br /><br />I am reading this Forum for a while and this is my first post now. I have a question to you.<br /><br />I own a nice bottle of Midleton Rare 1967 35 years old. I have not opened it (yet) and it is stored in my cellar. I wonder how much the value of this bottle is. If I am informed correctly, there are (or were) just 282 bottles of it.<br /><br />Who knows the actual market price?<br /><br />Thanks to all of you<br />Tom</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Tom,<br /><br />welcome to the forum,<br /><br />it was a special bottling for the whisky exchange in 2002, a rare blend made before it went into a cask, and matured for 35 years if i am correct<br />i believe it was an experiment.<br /><br />if i remember correctly, they were sold for Â£110 and the last 4 bottles was bought by a Hungarian ball(i)x, who's name begins with Z  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <br /><br />i have a bottle open, and it is a fantastic whiskey<br /><br />do to its small quantity, and it is unusual, and sold out 7 years ago, i would not sell my bottles for less than 500 euros, but that not means it worth that for some people<br /><br />one thing for sure, it is very rare, i have not seen 1 in the whiskyauction.com in their history, ebay.co.uk can not sell spirits any more, and i have not seen it even before on any ebay sites like ebay.com or .de or other auction sites<br /><br />so it is a valuable bottle, if you wanna drink it, i am sure you wont be disappointed, but surely worth some money right now, and more later<br /><br />regards;<br /><br /> Zoltan</div>
