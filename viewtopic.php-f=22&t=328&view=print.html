				<div class="content">I did a double take when I saw this thread <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />I am surprised that they are going to release another 'Rarest Vintage' so soon after the 2007. And to echo the point above, I sincerely hope that they have learned their pricing lesson from the last disaster. Nothing like the market cutting your price almost in half to underwhelm a brand. Pity, because it really is a tasty sup! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif" alt=":geek:" title="Geek" /> <br /><br />Any ideas what the new unique angle will be with this vintage? The '07 had the Port Pipe element - what will set this one apart I wonder? Or will it just be older &amp; rarer? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Cheers,<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">I would hope there would not be another slant on a new vintage. The taste should be different alright  like a single cask but hopefully the same premise. No point going mickey mouse and doing something completly different in my opinion. They have a very structured and well balanced range(Pricing apart) and probably should not go messing around with it.<br /><br />The pricing issue is really only an irish issue on their price points compared to the rest of the world.<br /><br />I think we are seeing a pull back from this though with the numerous 10 - 20% off offers on IDL premium bottles (i.e. 12yo up). However they should stop messing arpound and just cut them back.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The first 3 editions of JRVR (’07,’08,’09) were based on Port cask inclusion and are essentially the same. However, they are not all from one vatting. Each year, the product is bottled from a new vatting. Therefore, in some cases, some barrels included may vary slightly from the previous year.<br /><br />The initial bottling in 2007 was a vatting taken from three individual parcels of casks.<br /><br />The 2008 offering came from the same three parcels, therefore the final product was similar in style but effectively matured one year longer.<br /><br />The 2009 offering used casks from two of the original parcels plus some casks which were one year younger than the original.<br /><br />It is the case that each year’s vintage will be slightly different although based on a consistent JRVR style.</div></blockquote><br /><br />From <a href="http://blog.maltadvocate.com/2009/12/01/irish-whiskey-news-on-jameson-redbreast-powers-and-paddy/#comments" class="postlink">HERE</a></div>

				<div class="content">Ok, this is news to me! There was also an '08 release of JRVR?? Where was that sold? Seriously, how rare can something be if there is going to be a new version of it sold every year! <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />J.</div>
