				<div class="content">Segment just finished,<br /><br />Spoke about the long term nature of exploration/commodity ventures.<br /><br />Difficulty of long term efforts to establish a whiskey brand. Work in progress.<br /><br />However he's views in the economy were the most interesting, concise, direct and pragmatic analysis.<br /><br />From corporate raider to risk taker to entrepreneur, admirable qualities in abundance. Those in power could do well to take more advice from long term thinkers like John Teeling  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I don't know if he's putting himself about more, or if I've just started noticing him since I got into whiskey but he seems to be on call for opinions about business and the economy lately.<br /><br />A good thing too. He proves a couple of things that are not at all obvious: Irish companies can compete on the world stage; and we can still make stuff in this country.</div>

				<div class="content">i just wonder where that 2 million for advertisement goes every year?<br /><br />i have not seen much of that in Ireland, apart from a few ads in magazines.<br /><br />as i have posted in another thread, why is this new re-branded and distillery reserve Kilbeggan launch went behind curtains?<br /><br />if they want to make people ask for it in the pubs, this event should be all over TV - Radio, Newspapers and not lastly our society months before the launch, and wind people up for the big day, and let them rush for a bottle or two to shops pubs etc<br /><br />if i was their marketing manager.....</div>

				<div class="content">I would disagree, this is a very limited distillery bottling, the first batch of many. I think it is entirely appropriate that everyone who has supported Cooley locally in Kilbeggan are honoured in this way. You have to remember it was the local  people who campaigned the keep the building intact, it was the locals who helped restore the building, create a heritage venue and coffee shop. They had to foresight to see that it could create local employment again and aid the local economy and Cooley was a big part of that journey.<br /><br />Have you forgotten the Connemara launch, I for one was honoured to have Cooley support us in that way. They will be plenty of events in the future, I would be happy to be considered for the occasional event, you have to remember that we (the IWS) are in existence for less than two years.</div>

				<div class="content">I think I'm with Zoltan on this. One thing John Teeling said today was that they have to build their brand pub-by-pub, tasting-by-tasting. But that's only because they have completely neglected the internet. Another key element of brand-building is finding the &quot;influencers&quot; - the &quot;network hubs&quot; - that themselves convert others. Hello! That's the Irish Whiskey Society! We act as unpaid zealots raving about Cooley's products to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />This was a PR event. They already know how keen we are to get our hands on this new whiskey. They should have invited our Prez to attend the launch. It's just good business.</div>

				<div class="content">To me it sounded like a very private gathering and a thank you to the Kilbeggan distillery committee so I'd be with WhiskeyBro on this one. Further there is only going to be 1000 possibly upto 2000 of these Distillery bottlings so no real need for any raz-a-mataz. This is only going to be avilable in the Distillery and no Distillery really pushes these as they sell to distillery tourists anyway so why bother publicise it.<br /><br />In relation to the regular Kilbeggan this is only being relaunched in the US and Germany and again there is no reason to involve any Irish sources as yet until the time comes for that to come into effect. There will probably be a launch for Kilbeggan in Ireland at a later date.</div>

				<div class="content">I understood that. But it just looks like a demonstration of Cooley's internet blindness to me. They can't have a PR launch of a product in the US without us knowing about it instantly over here, so why try? Cooley should promote a global dialogue about its whiskeys among consumers, like we do on the forum here.</div>
