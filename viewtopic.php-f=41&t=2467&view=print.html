				<div class="content">Recently came into possession of this Black &amp; White bottle which looks a tad aged, 80's or 90's possibly?<br /><br />I was wondering if there were any whisky geeks that could date it?<br /><br />I'm curious as to how long it's been sitting in a cabinet of a disused office at work before I attempt to drink it!<br /><br />Slainte</div>

				<div class="content">Would not know how old it is but it does not look that old and I would probably not even go past 90's ... however I could be very wrong. Should be no issue in drinking it though the high ABV on spirits make them perfect for self preservation <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> . I've drank a few bottles with considerable age and I'm still here   <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  The oldest was a Jameson circa 90 years bottled and was a great experience. <br /><br />Go fot it, not saying the Black and White will be any good though  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>
