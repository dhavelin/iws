				<div class="content">I think this is something we should get going. However we may do it peoperly this year but maybe lets have a fun and informal poll for last year 2009.<br /><br />Please join in the fun and vote in the polls for the best Irish whiskey of 2009 for you.<br /><br />We can then collate results and do an overall poll from the best 2 or 3 from each section.<br /><br />I will put the over all poll in this thread eventually  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Please try and use you 3 votes in each section.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

Try and get something together for our final tasting in November. Therefore I'd suggest voting cards done up for October tasting and we can also do an online vote and collate both together.<br /><br />We just need to if we should have categories etc.</div>

The way I look at it ... if Jameson wins year after year it is up to others to topple that crown</div>

				<div class="content">I think the only way to do this is to come up with a few categories, then get members to make nominations. You could the make a short list based on how many nominations there are in each category, say the five or ten highest, then have an open vote. It would be relatively easy to do from that viewpoint. The only hard bit I forsee is agreeing the categories / parameters.</div>

				<div class="content">So what about 2012? I expect yellow spot will feature strongly but I think it was a much quieter year for new releases. <br /><br />What have we got for 2012 - nothing new from bushmills that I can recall ( apart from something with honey???), yellow spot, some single casks, VR2012, and Jameson select (or was that 2011), and whatever Cooleys came out of which I can only  remember a few right now - sorry guys but there are those much better informed on this than I.<br />So what is the list?

				<div class="content">The Redbreast 21 got the nod this year for the Irish Whiskey Awards, voting was different this year as it was blind tastings. Sadly I didn't taste all the samples and therefore didn't vote. I'm sure these issues will be sorted in time.</div>
