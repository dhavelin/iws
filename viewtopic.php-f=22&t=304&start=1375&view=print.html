				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>zenmonk wrote:</cite>Redbreast 21 all Xmas. Wow.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I think we had a similar Christmas.<br /><br />Tonight it's a 27yr old Cameronbridge and a 1991 single cask Midleton.<br />Both very good and (dare I say it) remarkably similar in some ways. That said the nose on the Midleton is far superior and the taste more complex. But great as both these are the stand out dram tonight is (purists avert your eyes) a blend of the two - approx 70% Midleton 30% CB. It's like an aged version of the Celtic whiskey shops first single cask blend. I always felt though that bourbon cask SPS was a bit one dimensional on it's own and benefitted from either a bit of sherry cask or some grain.</div>

				<div class="content">Picked up two bottles of this, one for myself out of curiosity and one for a mate who done a favour or two for me.<br />A glass in and its not looking like he's getting the 2nd bottle!<br /><br />Much smoother/rounder than regular jameson, a lot of the bite is mellowed with a beautiful stout, almost chocolate nose.<br />Big round chocolate/stout flavour on first drink, but with some fruity tones coming through after a few moments and even a slight taste of spice, possibly cinnamon or clove.<br />Slight bit of heat after swallowing, but much more mellow than anything else ive had, and a definite big, round, smooth stout aftertaste. Just beautiful and at a hair under 40 quid, a bargain!<br /><br /><br />(pardon my relatively novice description of taste, im fairly new to this game)<br /><br /><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5324/17439780436_8c222190a9_c.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
