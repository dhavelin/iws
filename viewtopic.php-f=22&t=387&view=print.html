As it is getting a bit carried away too like IDL's.<br /><br />The Connemara 12yo is ludicrously priced so I cannot see a decent price for an 18yo. To be quite honest I'm also really getting hacked off by the common place €100 price tag on all these single casks and don't think I'll be buying them much anymore as a matter of principle. Why buy a 18yo Tyconnell, Connemara or Jameson for that matter if I can get the likes of Laphroaig 18yo for around 70Euro...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /></div>

				<div class="content">Gotta agree, Adrian.<br />I've sampled the CWS PPS, and it's lovely. But at that price, it's also ridiculous. And I'm fully aware that this is due to the distiller rather than the retailer.<br />Ditto with the 17 yo Tyrconnell and Connemara. Both smashing whiskeys, both crazily overpriced.<br />And that's overpriced in comparison to the Scotch market, which most commentators agree is itself crazily overpriced.<br />My resolution for this year is to stick to reasonably priced drams I know and trust, like Green Spot and Black Bush, and rely on the IWS to introduce me to new whiskeys.<br />Hopefully the Irish distillers will realise that the interest in their whiskeys is not waning from enthusiasts, but people's ability and desire to pay such skyhigh prices is ebbing away in the current economic climate.</div>

I'm not entirely sure about this, of course.</div>
