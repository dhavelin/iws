				<div class="content">Anyone drank a lot of Japanese?<br />I've had some Suntory in the past, and a Yamazaki 12 and 18 yo, both of which were very tasty.<br />But probably my best experience of their spirit was in Glasgow last year when I sampled the Hakushu heavily peated malt.<br />This was very possibly the whisky that finally turned me on to smokey spirits. Mind you, I had the Laphroaig quarter cask back to back with it, and the two of them were excellent, but I still recall that Hakushu being amazing.<br />Like some others I suspect, I'll be along to the CWS Japanese tasting tomorrow.<br />But in advance of that, I'd be keen to hear people's experiences of Japanese whiskies, being very much a novice to their drams.</div>

				<div class="content">So what do y'all think after the CWS Japanese whisky tasting?<br /><br />They were all decent, with the Yamazaki 18yo my favourite of the lot. But still, I didn't rate any of them as a whisky I would buy.<br /><br />That's the second time I've done a sweep through a bunch of Japanese whiskies, with the same result.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't have my notes from that tasting handy, but I do recall thinking that I preferred the Yamazakis that I've tried in the past more than anything that was on offer.<br />They all seemed like mid-quality scotches to me.<br />I wanted to get a Karuizawa 71 as it is my birth year, but it got hyped and prices ran away from me quickly before I had time to save up for it.<br />I'm sure it's nice, but like some Irish bottlings recently, it seems to be a product of overpricing and hype.<br />Then again perhaps I'm just bitter at missing out on something spectacular.</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry to dissappoint you guys but I got my grubby mits on a bottle and I loved it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />I paid Â£110 for a 36yo vintage whiskey which I thought was a cracking price. Beats the prices for Bowmore  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I do have to say it was an amazing zbottle and I've really enjoyed it and what was more amazing for a 36yo whiskey it was 64.1%  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  A brute but brilliant.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure. It might just be that the bottle is slightly more than 70cl, so it's not filled as much. Just my guess, though. <br /><br />All the pictures on the net have the same fill level - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.whiskynotes.be/upload/Karuizawa197236yo_119A/JAPAN_KAR10_thumb.jpg">http://www.whiskynotes.be/upload/Karuiz ... _thumb.jpg</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">Is it possible they use the same line for bottling 700ml and 750ml? Then one would be a little under-full and the other a little over-full. Or maybe they ran out of the 700ml bottles. Just speculating...</div>

Japan has very hot summers in parts so definitelywould be a reason for the high ABV of such an old whiskey. <br /><br />The extra space idea could also be a logical conclusion but hate to think that they are storing their botles in hot conditions.<br /><br />DH's explaination would be another logical answer.
