				<div class="content">I'm a bit worried about this release from the whiskey drinkers/connoisseurs point of view, sounds like it may come with premium packaging &amp; a hefty price tag, but i'll reserve judgement until we know officially.<br /><br />I'd be curious to know how this will compare with the younger Ardbeg releases - price wise ?<br /><br />That said a lot of work has gone into 1,000 bottles from what I hear.</div>

				<div class="content">Truthfully I'm also incredibly dubious about what bog oak, an organic material that has been subject to natural decomposition and subsequent acidic leeching under water, could offer to a whiskey. I like the idea, but I can't help but feel that the spirit would have benefited much more from a more imaginative, lively, wood maturation. The price tag of €250 to me signals that this is a once off, an experiment that really isn't intended to be repeated. Or maybe it's just the going rate for a whiskey that's sold with a stave section!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">I can understand that price is a factor with any purchase. People will have to decide what they are willing to pay.  <br /><br />I think that David and Samuel have done a great job of reviewing the whiskey...<br /><br />&quot;Now we have a very balanced whiskey. The peat is exactly where I like it: contributing to the ensemble without being obvious. There is nothing about this whiskey that I wish was different. It's a cracker!&quot; - Irish Whiskey Notes<br /><br />&quot;I find some touches of lemon curd and arrack and there is a slight kind of metallic note with touches of gunpowder. This is really mouthwatering stuff! When I warm the glass in my hands the whiskey really opens up and actually reveals it’s high ABV. The scents get more intense and a kind of ”carbonated bubblyness” appears that tickles my nose.&quot; - Connemara Clan<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />I know what I want Santa to bring me this Christmas...</div>

Maybe for collecting. I know there's older whiskey in it too. What would this taste like if there was no bog oak involved?<br /><br />I think, beyond the airport, there'll be only 30 bottles or so available in Dublin, more in Kilbeggan.</div>
