				<div class="content">Thank-you for your offer Zoltan, but do Committee members not have to be specifically elected by the membership of the Society? Perhaps I have misread our Constitution, if so I apologise. For the record, I have absolutely no problem with having balance; as long as the right of the general membersip to elect those who represent/serve them is not diluted. I think that is fair?<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">Perhaps it's not clear in the Constitution (I haven't read it closely myself) but there is provision for &quot;fermentation&quot; sub-committees to carry out specific tasks. So, for example, the Grand Crew bottling last year was done by a special sub-committee of one.<br /><br />This was the intention of having sub-committees - that expertise could be brought on board where that was lacking in the standing committee.<br /><br />That's what we have here too. We want a better gender balance and we don't really know how to achieve it. Hence the invitation.<br /><br />But sure, I see your point. I'm not going to get caught up in procedure but if a member wants to call for a formal process then I won't object.</div>

				<div class="content">I think David is correct, individuals can be co-opted for individual projects, however all the key positions will be subject to annual re-election at the agm. The committee is hoping to get a new infusion of talent each year, also it is good corporate governance to have a balance between steady turnover and stability, hopefully we are achieving that e.g. the President becomes ex-officio member in his final year. I think we are fortunate at the level of interest and commitment thus far from the committee members and would also extend the hand to John to get further involved.</div>

				<div class="content">Once again, many thanks for the offer. Unfortunately given my current committment to other organisations and projects I would be unable to give the required level of attention that a committee position would require. I certainly wouldn't rule it out in the future however and it would undoubtedly be a pleasure to work on the committee.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Back to my original point however, which is that it would be a shame to develop a habit of creating 'rules &amp; regs' and then ignore the protocols that they demand. 'Committee Members' should be such by way of a vote! Otherwise who knows what they represent or what way their policies will influence budgets and promotions? The 'sub committee / co-opted' business is not something I'm familiar with so I don't really know how that works within the Society however that was not how the position was originally represented? Once again this is just highlighting a democratic issue and is not in anyway a reflection of the strengths/weaknesses of any proposed officers <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes you are correct Michael, I had missed it myself.<br /><br />In the very last lin eof Article 18 it states.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> <span style="font-weight: bold">Article 18</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">&quot;The Committee may appoint Sub-Committees (Fermenters) to assist in specific areas.&quot;</span><br /><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />I think maybe every so often the Committee should formally ask members if they are interested in helping out.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Michael. You're spot-on, there is certainly nothing wrong with the appointment of sub-committees etc comprised of members who have an interest or particular competence in a particular field. In fact it should be encouraged! The confusion, I believe, stems from the manner of the initial e-mail announcement whereby it was mentioned that a new <span style="font-weight: bold">committee member</span> had joined, without any reference to a particular sub-committee or co-option process. Hence the election question! Simples <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />J.</div>
