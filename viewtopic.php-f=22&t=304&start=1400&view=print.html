				<div class="content">Springbank 18 year old.<br />When I wander from Ireland, in both the whiskey and geographical sense ,I don't like to go too far.  Often I can't manage to get beyond Campbeltown which, as the crow flies, is only a few miles from Bushmills.  I love the products of that fair town in all its shapes, forms and varieties.  <br />My latest engagement is with this 18 y.o. I bought the second last bottle in the stock of the Celtic Whiskey Shop; half way through the bottle I decided this love affair is too good to last. And so I sped back to the CWS for the last remaining bottle.  Alas, some bounder had nipped in and bought it.  <br />Reader, were you that person?  If so, enjoy as much as I did/do!</div>

				<div class="content">Had a lot of fun with tastings over the weekend:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- Teeling Single malt </span>which is delicious. Very similar to bushmills but theres an extra edge to it. Bottle half gone already.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- Teeling small batch.</span> Hated it. Tasted sharp, brutally bitter, and mostly just an alchol taste. the kind that makes you shudder. If i wanted that taste id go for the cheapest tesco brand label. will be avoiding in future. left the end of that bottle at a party and was happy to be done with it.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">- Jameson 12. </span>Surprised by this one with how malty it is, for a pot still blend. I know they use malted barley in the recipe but it never came out so strongly in any other jameson i tried. Very chocolate/toffee based flavor. Would be tempted to pick up a bottle if it was at the right price.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-black bush -</span> must have gotten through the best part of a bottle of this over the weekend. its a staple go to whenever im out, suitably tasty and not overly pricy when out and about.</div>
