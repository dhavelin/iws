				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Joel1802 wrote:</cite>What's you focus right now (WW2)?</div></blockquote><br />The activities at Bletchley Park, in particular. I have visited there many times over the last couple of years and have been fortunate to meet some people who worked there during the war. I do like to hear personal experiences because that period is slipping out of living memory but it's a time that shouldn't be forgotten. I met a veteran of the Battle of Britain and the Dambusters Squadron recently too.<br /><br />Aside from that I'm reading Gitta Sereny's biography of Albert Speer which is one of the most remarkable books I've ever read. I think she has got as close to the thinking of her subject as any biographer can.<br /><br />Any favourite periods of military history yourself?</div>

				<div class="content">I'm a bit of a nomad, I've just finishing up Belfast's Unholy War: the Troubles of the 1920s (I suppose that makes it para-military history).  Generally the world wars get about half of my attention.  I had a wonderful conversation with a chap who spent WW2 in corvettes in the North Atlantic about a year ago.  Used to share a pew with a D-Day vet too (Juno), but he died almost exactly three years ago.<br /><br />I've never managed to get to Bletchly, though I have a suspicion my great Grandfather may have has some involvement.  He was a technician for Post Office phones and couldn't talk about his war work before he died in the '70s.  I've wondered for some time if he was one of the ones drafted into Bletchly.  That said I suppose there are many things such a tech might have been doing, but he did spend some time in the right area...</div>

They had GPO workers on site and off (Dollis Hill was one GPO location) constructing machines from telephone exchange parts, including the world's first computer.<br /><br />There is a partial list of people who worked at BP <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/history/RollofHonour.rhtm" class="postlink">here</a> but that mightn't quite cover GPO personnel. Otherwise you could try contacting BT or Royal Mail to see what records they have kept.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome Joel!!  It's nice to see a fellow Canadian active on the forum.  If you're ever in southern Ontario between London and Toronto, let me know and we can try to get together.  The LCBO is working on boosting their Irish whiskey offerings, though some of the current &quot;hot&quot; bottles (Redbreast 12 CS, Yellow Spot, Powers John's Lane, etc.) haven't made it here yet.  I'm waiting to have the LCBO re-stock the Jameson 18 so that I can pick up a bottle.  Generally, I have found Canadian and US retailers to have better pricing of Irish bottles than Ireland does!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Here's the current LCBO offerings if your travels ever bring you this way:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?STOCK_TYPE_NAME=All&amp;ITEM_NAME=&amp;KEYWORDS=&amp;ITEM_NUMBER=&amp;productListingType=&amp;LIQUOR_TYPE_SHORT_=Spirits&amp;CATEGORY_NAME=Whisky%2FWhiskey&amp;SUB_CATEGORY_NAME=Irish&amp;PRODUCING_CNAME=*&amp;PRODUCING_SUBREGION_N=&amp;PRODUCING_REGION_N=*&amp;UNIT_VOLUME=*&amp;SELLING_PRICE=*&amp;LTO_SALES_CODE=&amp;VQA_CODE=&amp;KOSHER_CODE=&amp;VINTAGES_CODE=&amp;VALUE_ADD_SALES_CO=&amp;AIR_MILES_SALES_CO=&amp;SWEETNESS_DESCRIPTOR=&amp;VARIETAL_NAME=&amp;WINE_STYLE=&amp;language=EN&amp;style=+LCBO.css&amp;page=1&amp;action=result&amp;sort=sortedName&amp;order=1&amp;resultsPerPage=50" class="postlink">http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?STOCK_TYPE_NAME=All&amp;ITEM_NAME=&amp;KEYWORDS=&amp;ITEM_NUMBER=&amp;productListingType=&amp;LIQUOR_TYPE_SHORT_=Spirits&amp;CATEGORY_NAME=Whisky%2FWhiskey&amp;SUB_CATEGORY_NAME=Irish&amp;PRODUCING_CNAME=*&amp;PRODUCING_SUBREGION_N=&amp;PRODUCING_REGION_N=*&amp;UNIT_VOLUME=*&amp;SELLING_PRICE=*&amp;LTO_SALES_CODE=&amp;VQA_CODE=&amp;KOSHER_CODE=&amp;VINTAGES_CODE=&amp;VALUE_ADD_SALES_CO=&amp;AIR_MILES_SALES_CO=&amp;SWEETNESS_DESCRIPTOR=&amp;VARIETAL_NAME=&amp;WINE_STYLE=&amp;language=EN&amp;style=+LCBO.css&amp;page=1&amp;action=result&amp;sort=sortedName&amp;order=1&amp;resultsPerPage=50</a><br /><br />Sorry for the long link... <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /></div>

With 30 years under your belt there is a fair bit of whiskey mileage there so you must know what you like. So hearing what you think of new whiskeys (for you) would be very interesting.</div>
