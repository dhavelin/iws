				<div class="author">by <strong>Carl</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Greetings from Vancouver!<br />Never too late in life to discover new avenues of pleasure! So began- at age 61 - my passion for Scotch and Irish Whiskies. A conversation with a friend just before Christmas 2010 convinced me to buy my first single malt. Having done considerable research,  I was intrigued by the infamous Laphroaig Quarter Cask.  &quot;Not recommended for a novice!&quot; Such proclamations only motivate me to do the opposite. So it was: my first bottle of Single Malt Scotch Whiskey, Laphroaig Quarter Cask. It is now a favourite!<br />Over the years, I had tried various Scotch whiskies including the Glenlivet single malt, and have had many bottles of Jameson Irish Whiskey, including a Special Reserve 12 year old. But I had never sampled the delights of single malts in earnest. A few months later, I now have several wonderful single malt Scotch whiskies, and am thoroughly enjoying myself. <br />In the past couple of weeks, I started learning more about Irish whiskies. Wonderful reviews of Bushmills Black Bush, and the added incentive of very reasonable cost tempted me. My first bottle of Black Bush, and my first tasting, took place last Monday, the 31st of January. After my first nosing and first taste, I was in awe. How could a spirit so reasonably priced be so incredibly smooth and delicious!? Normally, I don't drink much during the work week. In this case, I have had at least a few drams every night. The Bushmills Black Bush has become my favourite spirit - bar none, including all single malts and blended whiskies that I have sampled so far. Different moods for different whiskies is the norm for me. One evening, a Highland Park. Next, maybe a Laphroaig. Then, maybe a Glendronach or a Glenfarclas. The one constant for me is the Black Bush. For this one, I am always in the mood. It is the epitome of what I always dreamed a whiskey would be: not harsh, extremely smooth, not too sweet, not too dry, a wonderful syrup like thickness which rolls beautifully around the tongue and about the mouth, and an incredible medium dry finish. Never disappointing in even the slightest way.<br />Sorry to ramble. This is meant to be an introduction, and not a review. So for now - Good night!<br />Cheers,<br />Carl</div>

				<div class="content">My name is Wally.  I enjoy whiskey from Ireland, Canada and Kentucky, USA.  I am open to learning about all whiskey around the world, but so far the 3 I listed are the ones that I prefer.  My favorite whiskey from college is Jameson Gold.  It once retailed in a pot still bottle for around 35 euro.  Now it retails under the distinction, Jameson Gold Reserve in a tall bottle.  Middleton Very Rare has become my favorite lately, however, I have the rare occasion to enjoy it due to the cost.  I will sign on here from time to time over the coming months, hopefully at least once a week.  If you have any knowledge to share with me I would greatly appreciate it.  I am hungry for information.  That is it for now.  Slainte,  Wally</div>

				<div class="content">Hello, I am Alan Davidson a Scot from Glasgow originally.<br />I came to (was posted to) Ireland in the late sixties as a young man, since collecting wife, children, debts etc.<br />I then spent many years in Brussels at the European HQ of my company and travelled extensively in Central + Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. This gave the opportunity for entertainment at others expense(!) and of course regular access to duty free....so a taste for single malt developed.<br /><br />I first came across a forum with Bladnoch and was delighted to see Raymond in these introductions. I have been there and met him although he won't remember. It was on that forum when I mentioned I was returning to Ireland with my wife in 2009 that someone suggested I contact this group.<br /><br />I have attended a few meetings and enjoyed them well, and whilst I recognise that the primary aim is towards Irish rather than Scotch I can live with that and signed up for full membership last month ! <br /><br />There is much expertise and many experts in the group, whereas I am merely a well intentioned amateur. I have a couple of dozen bottles at home and a hogshead of sherry casked Bruichladdich maturing on Islay.<br /><br />Best wishes to everyone.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi AlanD! Great to see someone from the tastings here. I know we would all love to get more feedback on the forum about the tastings, what could be improved, and what folks would like to see in the future.<br /><br />I'm like yourself: a well-intentioned amateur. It's true we want to compehensively explore Irish whiskey and we snag the new releases if we can but Scotch is firmly on the agenda too. I'm still overwhelmed by the number and variety of Scottish distilleries so I'm depending on the society to shed some light.</div>

				<div class="content">Nice that you could make it Alan and great to have you on board. There will be plenty of variety at the tasting though. out of the 11 meetings we had last year 4 had Scotch content with one solely dedicated to the Islands. We also had 2 nights dedicated to Japanese and American respectively so hopefully plenty of variety.<br /><br />Bladnoch is a great forum and I must make my way to Bladnoch to hook up with Raymond at some stage too.<br /><br />So anyway welcome to the gang and make yourself at home.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Everyone,<br /><br />    My name is Tommy and I am from North Carolina over in the States. I have been an Irish Whiskey drinker since before I was legal. I am of Irish and Scottish decent, so naturally I have a love for whiskey, but Irish is by far my favorite. I am mainly a Jameson drinker, or I should say anything from the Midleton Distillery, love Midleton Rare and like Paddy's. Have tried some for all the other Distilleries as well but not really as big of as a fan, Bushmills probably being my least favorite out of what I have tried. Not really bad just not my first choice. Whiskey from the Cooley Distilliery would probably be my second choice.<br /><br />   I have only recently started to collect Whiskey so right now my collection is very small. The two highlights would be a Midleton Very Rare 2007, the year I graduated College and I will be picking up my first bottle of Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve in a couple of weeks. One of the goals of my collection is to eventually get a Midleton Very Rare for certain years in my life, IE 1985 for birth year, 2007 for College Graduation, and then one for the year I get married and have kids, etc.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there I am a blow in from the Boards.ie Beer &amp; Wine &amp; Spirits forum. My name is Paul and even though I am 41 I really only have discovered the joy of single malt particularly peated single malt in recent times primarily because of a close friend introducing me to Laphroaig 10yr which was a revelation to me. So I have started exploring these Whiskys along with Irish ones and at the moment my current prefered tipple is Bowmore 12yr with Black Bush as the preferred Irish Whiskey. <br /><br />Really enjoying lurking and reading all the threads here and looking forward to discovering all the Whiskeys that are available out there (budget depending of course!). Will try and join up and attend a tasting or two when they happen again in the near future <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

I've been on there since the start and have been a moderator in the past. I'd say hang around just don't actively pimp this site. I found here and joined up from clicking through your sig link.<br /><br />Going away for a few days and will be near Lockes Distillery next week so I'll be dropping in there for the tour next week. Really enjoying my journey into the realm of Whiskey &amp; Whisky and wish I had a little more free cash to sample as far and wide as I can. Hopefully that will change in the near future.</div>

Have put together a nice little collection in that time, mainly from the Cooley distillery, a few Jamesons and Bushmills thrown in there as well.
