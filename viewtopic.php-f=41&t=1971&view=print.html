				<div class="content">I have two bottles - #251 and #252.  Both are in their original cylinders - but #251's bottle is empty.  I drank it and it was great.  #252 has not been opened and is being kept in a nice dark closet.  <br /><br />I think I paid about £78 for each bottle in 1999.  Does anyone have any idea what the values of these two (one empty and one full) bottles might be today?<br /><br />Regards</div>

				<div class="content">Certainly Peter Mulryans old 'Pajo' website indicated it was a Cooley malt with some small amount of old Jameson thrown in.</div>

				<div class="content">It was at most 10 year old Cooley Single Malt (distilling started Easter 1989) but most likely a younger whiskey. Preston's is usually a 10 year old Jameson blend although the website mentions pure pot still. It was bottled @ 43% from Cooley Cask #1319 on the 20 October 1999, yielding 330 bottles.<br /><br />No reports of note on the contents apart from the dubious &quot;Christmas Pudding&quot; tasting notes on the original website.  A collectible curiosity from yet another Millennium venture. I'd value it a €150-€200</div>

				<div class="content">The website mentions pure pot still, but Cooley were calling some of their stuff that back then anyway. They called the whiskey malt. <br /><br />It's not clear, but are they not suggesting the whiskey the mixed in is from the original distillery?</div>
