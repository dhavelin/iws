They were all finished distilling by the 1940s but the distillery bottlings may have continued for a while after that.<br /><br />More knowledgeable people will be able to give you more accurate information regarding screw-caps vs corks etc, or perhaps identify which of the three it could have been from.<br /><br />It might also be worthwhile to look at secondary sources e.g. was this in your grandfather's whiskey cupboard, or was it found in the cellar of an old pub etc? You might be able to get an idea of its era from that.</div>

				<div class="content">Interesting find and a nice curiousity.<br /><br />As the previous poster said the Dublin Distillers Co Ltd was founded in 1891 and was the amalgamation of three distilleries, George Roe, Thomas St; William Jameson, Marrowbone Lane; &amp; DWD, Jones Road. The three distilleries continued to bottle under their own brand names. Most distilling activity ceased around 1926, but bottling continued until the early 1940s.<br /><br />The offices of  The Dublin Distillers Co Ltd, was based at 157 Thomas St., Dublin, Co. Dublin next door to the offices of George Roe at 156 Thomas Street.<br /><br />It is most likely what you have is a lead capsule dating from the period between 1891 and 1930 other than that impossible to be more specific other than to say any bottling under the name Dublin Distillers Co Ltd is quite rare.</div>
