				<div class="content">Some nice buys there JC ...<br /><br />Myself and Leo (and my other brothers) purchased a 1960 Straithisla last year for one of our Brothers who hit 50. A nice way to mark a 50th.<br /><br />I've also had a chance to taste Leo's 1967 Straithisla and it was a very nice whisky indeed. I think for the age they are great value whiskies so best of luck with yours.<br /><br />Had a Longmourn 1971 myself a couple years ago which was under 100 and eventhough did not blow me away it was good all the same.</div>

				<div class="content">I had an indie bottling of Glenfarclas last year which was unsherried, and it was really interesting. Chocolate as you say, but also astringent and fruity. This time around I couldn't resist the idea of going all out on a proper sherried version, and at the price, the 21 yo fitted the bill.<br />I'm being won around to the Speyside and Highlands malts when it comes to smokiness. The Islay thing is generally a bit much for me. A touch of peat amid some sherried sweetness sounds fine by me!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Glenfarclas is nearly always sherried, often heavily so.<br />They do use some bourbon barrels, but finding unsherried Glenfarclas isn't easy and can usually only be found in the occasional single cask independent bottling, as far as I'm aware.<br />Like Macallan, they've made their name as a sherried Scotch, but unlike Macallan, they haven't to my knowledge yet gone down the road of releasing unsherried whiskey under their own label.<br />According to Dr Whisky (who I don't always trust), Glenfarclas only use sherry butts or 'plain casks' (which are either refill bourbon barrels which have already held scotch or else are four times used sherry casks.)<br />But he said that around 3 years ago, and I think they might use the odd bourbon barrel today. But it all gets vatted in with the sherried spirit when they come to bottle it.</div>

And a bourbon barrel matured whisk(e)y is not a finish. Further a lot of heavily sherried batch whisk(e)y I imagine has at least a small ratio of bourbon  matured whisk(e)y. However some of those glenfarclas batch runs would give you good reason to think they were solely sherry matured. <br /><br />I would reckon there is not a distillery on the planet that does not use Bourbon barrels to mature some precentage of their whisk(e)y. Except for one exception which is of course is US distillers ... who obviously do not use bourbon barrels but fresh oak  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>zenmonk wrote:</cite>What would a good introduction to Scotch malts be?

Also Port Charlotte, and Kilchoman. These are all based on Islay with the exception of Longrow, which is heavily peated from Springbank. Others with something of a peat presence would be Highland Park, Springbank and Ardmore. There are some distilleries that dip their toe into peated releases but the above all make good consistent produce, and make peated whisky as standard. My personal favourites ( at a decent price ) would be -<br /> <br />Ardbeg 10, also Uigeadail and Corryvreckan<br />Longrow CV, also the 10yo 100 Proof and 14yo<br />Caol Ila &quot;Natural Cask Strength&quot;<br />Lagavulin 12 Cask Strength<br />Springbank 12 Cask Strength<br /> <br />Looking at these i notice none are widely found in supermarkets, so you'll need a 'good whisky' outlet if you want to try one of these.<br /> <br />edit: i forgot Bowmore, mainly as it's not my cup of tea.</div>

				<div class="content">bredman has covered it pretty well ... I'll just add a few of my favourites.<br /><br />I agree on the Highland Park ... evethough not heavily peated it does have some and is very much well worth exploring. <br />However if you are not used to cask strength whisky it may be worth considering this before you buy.<br />It is always good to start with the entry level bottles as you will not get overly stung if you don't like it. <br /><br />So <br /><br />HP 12yo.<br />Laphroaig 10yo or Quarter Cask <br />Caol Ila 12yo<br /><br />Might be worth  checking out Lagavulin 16yo also.<br /><br />Even better are minis or small bottles.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-7805.aspx" class="postlink">See this</a> in WHisky Exchange.</div>
