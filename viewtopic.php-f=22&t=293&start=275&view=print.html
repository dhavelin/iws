With Scotch malt that isn't allowed, for a while they used the term &quot;Full Strength&quot; or &quot;High Strength&quot; whenever they did this procedure, but now afaik they print nothing on the label. Imo &quot;Cask Strength&quot; should only be used when no water is added at all.</div>

They had the 13yo and 14yo. The &quot;World Whisky&quot; page on their website doesn't seem to work, so i phoned them up, i assume it's the same for their other stores too.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Shane,<br /><br />You may have gone in at the deep-end there if you were trying to develop a taste for the peated range. Maybe try something lighter like a 12yo Highland Park? It wouldn't be as smoky as the Ardbeg and is usually more balanced with honey on the nose and a 'pearish' finish.<br /><br />Just a suggestion <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi John and IWC <br /><br />Yep may have gone full pelt with the Ardbeg alright - will give the Highland a try - Locke's 8 yr old - have a bottle - must try it <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The other thing about the Ardbeg that really disappointed was the colour of it - When I poured it in the the glass I was like - Jaysus don't like the colour of that ! Shouldn't be a factor but it is . Lately have tried quite a few offerings from Scotland ( Glenmorangie , Singleton and a few Macallans ) - and each was a rich deep &quot;whiskey&quot; colour which for me adds to the experience of drinking whiskey . The really pale Ardbeg was onto a loser from the pour  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
