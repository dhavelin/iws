				<div class="content">Hello all , new to here ..... not a drinker as i got pancreatitis from it anyway i was clearing out the grandmothers shed and came across this bottle of jameson . Its not one i have seen before ( i am 26 ) and i cant find it online .<br /><br />Its 750ML 70proof 40%vol jameson whiskey , pics ....<br /><br />Its in mint condition as seen from pics , is this worth anything ? I know it doesnt age in the bottle only the barrel etc... but i am sure since its old and no longer sold that it would be worth more than 24 quid anyway ?<br /><br />Thanks <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">It for the late 70's, early 80's. They removed the 70°proof soon after. <br />It not worth huge money as there are a few still around. I'd estimate €40+.</div>
