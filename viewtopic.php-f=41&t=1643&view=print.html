				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />firstly it is a screw cap, so that dates it to the 1960s for starters, one to open and try as it is not worth very much<br /><br />I'll see if I can dig out a bit more info, <br /><br />Regards L</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the info.  My original guess was because the only bottles I could find with a label like that were from the late 30's to late 40's.</div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately yes it is probably 60's. So not going to be worth any major money.<br /><br />labels from most Irish Whiskey brands changed very little from the 1920's to the 1960's so it is very easy to mistake an age of a bottle. And looking at the cap and bottle type can be the best way of dating bottles.</div>

				<div class="content">Just wondering if anybody has an opinion on an age for this one.<br /><br />A Bushmills with 1784 on it instead of the more outlandish 1608 nonsense.<br /><br />The label is unfortunately only a partial fragment at this stage.<br /><br />I thinking it is very much like the cream and gold gilt labels that were aged stated at 9yo or just Bushmills Whiskey but I've not been able to come across anything similar since I bought this. There is one on WhiskyAuction currently but does not have the embossed bottle and the label is different.<br /><br />However mine says Pure Malt as opposed to Just Bushmills Whiskey which seems to be the more common sighting. <br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Bushmills/Bushmills1784TornLable.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">I know I have read somewhere when they started putting the 1608 on the bottles, but I can't remember where or what date. I think it might have been mid 1960s or 1970s. But I'd say your bottle is a good bit older than that anyway. I have no idea, really.</div>

				<div class="content">I had no idea myself and don't want to get carried away but I can find no mention of Bushmills Pure Malt post the repeal of Prohibition.<br /><br />Any advertisments I've seen for Bushmills in the 1930's have all been Bushmills Irish Whiskey or a Blend of 100% Irish Whiskies or even just plain Bushmills. The pure malt term seems to have been dropped but that is not concrete proof. Rreally would like to know if this is a really old bottle or not though.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />My guess and it is only that, is somewhere between 1914-1930<br /><br />The bottle shape suggests later, but the seal suggests earlier.<br /><br />I note the word Limited is missing from below 'The Old Bushmills Distillery Co.'<br /><br />Sadly the lower part is missing and older bottles again mention 'Hill St Belfast'<br /><br />also I can,t see any bubbles in the glass bottle?<br /><br />Cheers TWB</div>
