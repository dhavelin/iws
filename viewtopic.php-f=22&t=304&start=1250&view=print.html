				<div class="content">Trying the A'bunadh it's not quiet what I expected. I expected more like the regular Aberlour. It's heavily sherried  and I get a hint of sulphur but may try again at a later date. <br />I assume they vary greatly from one batch to another. I can't believe how cloudy it got when I cut it with water. I even used mineral water as my mains is horrible lately.</div>

				<div class="content">Sulphur used to be common in some sherry monsters i.e. the likes of Glenrothes. However whether it is Sulphured is another question. There is a split in theory's over some sulphur tastes as It thought the use of Sulphur candles has ceased in the industry. IDL have stopped doing it for well over 20years ... yet I over head 2 well known industry experts or reviewers (for want of a better word) claim they tasted sulphur in a Midleton heavy pot sherry cask that was younger than that. I tasted the same whiskey and got more of a meaty taste which borders on sulphur too. It was at this IDL tasting that they were trying to show how some of their sherry casks are just too big for single cask release. I loved it but could see their reasoning as if they had blown the taste buds off two so called independent industry experts (in tasting) how would Joe public react  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />Anyway Willie the sulphur may subside after a while and it may not. If your struggling I'll take it off you hands  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  But too much of that characteristic can ruin the over all effect but hopefully it is just an initial flavour burst from initial opening.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm happy with The Aberlour.  It's very subtle anyway. <br /><br />I'm trying some Jon, Mark &amp; Robbo's Irish Malt Whiskey and some Glendronach. <br />The Irish is best described as soft. It won't stop me drinking it, but the Glendronach is fast becoming a favourite.</div>
