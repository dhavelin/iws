				<div class="content">I don't know if this is apropriate or a good idea, but I'll pitch it anyway. <br /><br />Say if some member would really like to try one of the more expensive whiskeys but didn't want to buy a whole bottle, then they could pitch it here, and anyone else who would like to do the same could chip in for a bottle. If there was enough interest... <br /><br />For example, a Willie Napier... If there were ten people interested, it could be bought for 50 euro each, and each buyer would get 7 cl . Or maybe something cheaper - Bowmore 25, whatever.<br /><br />I won't be offended if you think this is a rubbish idea. It's something that just popped into my head.</div>

				<div class="content">Here the deal, the airport are offering a &quot;double the difference&quot; if you can find the bottle cheaper in the city centre, so Midleton 1973 at the airport is €4000 and in CWS its only €2000 which means they refund you €4000!!! meaning yuo get the bottle free!!!! Well that was the case until yesterday, they have apparently taken it off sale. BUT it can be done for the 20th Anniversary !!!!</div>
