				<div class="content">And why?<br />Some people in the society have spent years building up formidable collections of Irish and other whiskey. But I was wondering whether people have favourites among such large collections?<br />It could be a bottle given to you by someone special, or a rare or ancient bottle that can't be found anymore. Or it can be a bottle that you just couldn't be without for some other reason.<br />Basically, what's the one bottle you'd grab if the house was on fire, and why is it your favourite?<br />To kick off - I'd say my favourite bottle is a Dunville's VR distilled around 1920. Firstly, because it's a Belfast whiskey, and there aren't many of those kicking around these days, and secondly because it's significantly older than most other bottles I have. Thirdly because I got it in Malta, but that's another story.<br />If I had a second favourite (there I go breaking my own rules!), it would have to be the Old Comber, as my Dad grew up in the shadow of the distillery, but was just too young to drink it before it closed for good. I was very proud to be able to get both him and me a bottle of the 33 yo bottled in the 80s. We drank his, but mine is still intact in the cupboard.<br />What about you? What's your favourite bottle?</div>

				<div class="content">As you say a hard question ....<br /><br />Probably has to be my <a href="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Pure%20Pot%20Still%20Whiskey/BlackEagle14yo.jpg" class="postlink">Black Eagle</a> Pure Pot Still Irish Whiskey.<br /><br />From Germany and bottled in the 70's and a whiskey that was distilled in the 1950's so it could easily be a Tullamore, Kilbeggan or even one of the Closed Dublin Distilleries. Really looking forward to the day I'll open this.<br /><br />After that it is probably my collection (I know cheating) of Knappogues ... 1951 (x2 one a single cask) and vintages 1990-1995 and the 15yo. <br /><br />Biggest disappointment which possibly could of been a contender was an old Kilbeggan which arrived broken ... I was gutted and I got it for under 100Euro  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">Interesting - a mystery favourite!<br />Maybe you'll be able to tell which distillery it's from if you ever crack it open?<br />Pity about your old Kilbeggan, though. I greatly sympathise. Part of the cork of my Dunville fell into the bottle as I brought it home, making the alcohol inside adulterated. It crushed me to think I don't have the option of ever tasting it.</div>

				<div class="content">There's a few sets I have that I like. The Powers 15 and the Midleton Reserve, bothing in the same style bottle. Or the set of Knappogues. Or the Old Irish gold 15 and 24. <br /><br />Probably my favourite is the Brusna Distillery bottling. I also like the old Jameson 7s, which I have a few of. And the Powers Pure Pot Still. But the Brusna (Kilbeggan) is my favourite.</div>

				<div class="content">I have to say my favourite is my bottle of 10yo William Jameson from c. 1920s/30s with miniature to match. Recently added a full bottle of William Jameson Irish American Whiskey from c. 1935 along with a couple of miniatures of the same. I have a bit of William Jameson ephemera to display with it also.<br /><br />I love it because of its rarity, and I have never heard of other bottles from this distillery which is amazing considering the volume of output as one of the big 4 Dublin distilleries.</div>

				<div class="content">A pretty cracking bottle all right ... I'm totally Jealous ... <br /><br />And the fact it has been labeled 'Aged for 10yrs in the Irish Free state' makes it easy to confirm what period it is from. Irish Free State 1922-1937. Strangely I have only seen it on William Jameson and George Roe bottles but would love to know if anybody else knows of any other to do the same.<br /><br />See the aforementioned bottle <a href="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Pure%20Pot%20Still%20Whiskey/WilliamJamesonSquare.jpg" class="postlink">HERE</a></div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately I have a number of favourites; stemming from either taste or the difficulty I had getting them! However I guess amongst my favourites I would have to name the Dungourney and a Greenspot 10yo. Both represent a uniquely Irish product respected for their quality and taste.<br />J.</div>
