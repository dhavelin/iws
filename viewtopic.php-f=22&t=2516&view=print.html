				<div class="content">Purchased a bottle of whiskey POWERS GOLD LABEL being in Ireland. Thinking about giving it as a present to my jewish friend. But it should be cosher, otherwise religious jews dont drink it. &quot;Cosher&quot; for whiskey means: no cask was used for production in which previously any wine was kept.<br />I tried to connect to the manufacturer but their site have some stupid gate based on my age. No matter what age, it does no allow me to enter the site.<br />Does anyone of you know what is the exact process for the given whisky production? I have the bottle on hand, its label bears what I posted. In addition, there is: &quot;Three swallow&quot; mark, &quot;Product of Ireland&quot;, &quot;Distilled and bottled in ??? by John Powers and Son&quot;, and &quot;Tripple distilled&quot;.<br />Any other data necessary? I can provide. Help please.<br /><br />Stan</div>

				<div class="content">The whiskey production should be kosher but I know many Whiskeys are matured in Ex-Sherried &amp; ex-Port casks. These are fortified wines and therefore may not be Kosher. <br />I'm not sure what ratio of Sherry Casks are used in Oowers but I know they're used.</div>

				<div class="content">'KELLAN' Irish whiskey which was a Cooley whiskey launched around 2008 and <br />which was exclusive to the U.S. market was the first whiskey that was Kosher<br />certified --- that is what it was advertised as at the time. Obviously a lot of other <br />brands have gone for Kosher certification since then.</div>
