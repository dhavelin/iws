				<div class="content">I have a couple of bottles of 12 yr old Redbreast from the 1960s which I have found details about but cannot find details on matching bottles of 10 yr old. The bottles are smaller and have a cream label and cream screw top. I cannot post a picture as I am using my phone. Any ideas on a value? <br />Also I have a collection of unusual and old promo bottles etc. how do I go about getting these valued?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">Difficult to say without knowing the size and seeing a picture.  Retail cost would probably be 300 - 400 for good condition and fill level based on a 26 ounce bottle, you'd see quite a bit less.  PM me if you are looking to sell, I might be interested.  Post pics if you can.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd agree with the previous poster, €300 - €400 is the Price they would sell for in a specialist retailer, however the same retailer would buy them for €150 - €200, a bid offer spread if you like, to cover taxes and margin. Pm me if you intend to sell regards.</div>

				<div class="content">we really need to see pictures of any bottles you have.<br /><br />In regards to the Redbreast, 3-400euro is a retail price and you will be very unlikely to achieve that in the open market.<br /><br />The 10 year old's will be slightly more rare than the 12 but in saying that they all pop up fairly regularly so not overly rare.<br /><br />can't really see these going for over 200 Euro<br /><br />Auction price for such bottles will be between 100-180 Euro so that is where you are looking at.<br /><br />However if anyone has evidence to the contrary please post.<br /><br />I've no interest in buying by the way. <br /><br />Cheers and thanks for posting.</div>

I have a nice few at home and I'll attach a photo of them. The most I've paid is for the cream label one. I've got some for €80 recently.<br />The screw cap ones are more recent. <br /><br />If they are similar to the ones I've posted I would be interested too.</div>
