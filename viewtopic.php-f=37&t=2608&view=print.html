				<div class="content">The first society tasting of the year promises to be epic. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.whiskymax.co.uk/charles-maclean/" class="postlink">Charles MacLean</a> &amp; the Scottish Malt Whisky Society are here. This could be an epic one. I expect they will be putting out all stops to show us how good they are. <br /><br />They entry price is €20 for members &amp; €30 for non-members. If rumours are to be believed it's a bargain. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://irishwhiskeysociety.wildapricot.org/event-2114885">https://irishwhiskeysociety.wildapricot ... nt-2114885</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">As a warm-up for this great event, have a view of the  Ken Loach film &quot;Angels' Share&quot;.  A great whisky-themed film with Charles Maclean playing himself (aka Ruari MacAllister).  Best viewed with a bottle of fine Speyside malt to hand.</div>

				<div class="content">Great idea Ken. I'd forgotten about that. It's great to see the tasting sell out so quickly too. Worth every penny.</div>

				<div class="content">That tasting went very well. <br />Here's what was tasted. <br />1 Linkwood 8 years old, 59%<br /><br />2 Auchentoshan 14yr, 59.9%<br /><br />3 Craggenmore 28yr, 58.1%<br /><br />4 Balmenach 14yr<br /><br />5 Bowmore 21yr, 56.6%<br /><br />6 Laphroaig 16yr, 58%<br /><br />My favourite was the Auchentoshan. It's so different from the regular one that I was really impressed. <br />I believe the Cragganmore was the most popular. It was probably the best but I was really surprised by that Auchentoschen.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, great tasting and could have stayed chatting to Charles till the cows came home. A very knowledgeable man in all things whisky. <br /><br />It is amazing how we are as people though are just so different as I was not too impressed with the Auchentoshan at all but it was also Charles' favourite on the night too.<br /><br />But that's what makes whiskey such a wonderful product as we all have such different views and so may it remain.<br /><br />The Balmenach was a disappointment for me though and I've had many a Balmenach but usually in the sherried variation and was a big fan but the Bourbon barrel was not to my liking at all. Possibly the least liked on the night over all too.<br /><br />The rest I thoroughly enjoyed with the Bowmore proving to be the one I would love to buy. Again not a huge hit over all as it was on the floral side which can but off putting for some but I actually like it when it is not too much in you face as it was in this case.<br /><br />The Laphroaig was excellent too but a typical mid teenage Laph and not the usual monster you can expect from Laphroaig. Nice and refined but still with a bit of umph due to the cask strength<br /><br />The Craggenmore was enjoyable but very complex as Charles stated but possibly too complex for the setting as it was hard (for me anyway) to get all that was going on in it but there was certainly a lot going on. One to be brought out on quite occasions when in the armchair by the fire.<br /><br />Linkwood was very nice too and although only a 8yo it was well worth the try. A beautiful light easy drinking whisky even at cask strength.</div>
