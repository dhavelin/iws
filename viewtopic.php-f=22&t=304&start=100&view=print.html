				<div class="content">Oh dear, the open bottles number has crept upwards again.<br />Currently got nine bottles open, including probably too many Bushmills.<br />Currently working through the hipflask-ful of 12 yo Caol Isla that sustained me on my holiday recently, and the dregs of one of the Bushmills 1608 400th anniversary bottling that I picked up at the start of the year.<br />I also still have a Black Bush open for visitors and a Bushmills Distillery edition 12 yo open for me!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br />And then there's the Irishman single malt, which is basically a beefy 12 yo bourbon-finished Bush ideal for summer drinking.<br />There's some smokey options for the mrs too - Connemara cask strength and a 21 year old Glen Garioch.<br />And I recently got given another Green Spot and a second set of the Kilbeggan 'test tubes' so this time I'm going to actually taste them.<br />If it weren't for the society tastings, it's entirely possible that I'd spend the rest of my life drinking mostly Bushmills. Not a bad prospect, but it is good to try new things, of course.</div>

				<div class="content">Had a dram of my oul lad's Old Comber the other day.<br />Nearly had to wrestle the bottle off him!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />The nose, as everyone comments, is staggeringly complex. I left the glass sitting for about 20 minutes and every five minutes it smelled totally different as it opened up. My notes were everywhere.<br />On the palate, I think this is a much maligned spirit. Jim Murray claimed it to be the wrong side of woody, and as far as I can see, everyone follows that opinion.<br />But I would disagree. I've not had the joy of drinking too many well-aged PPS's in my time, but this one seemed in great condition.<br />Sure, the wood comes through, with that varnish-y, dusty quality one expects from older PPS. But it's not without balance. I could go on all day about the strange, bizarre tastes that I kept finding, or imagining I was finding (hard to know which after a certain point  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ), but I won't.<br />Suffice to say, I was once again reminded of how happy I am to have a full bottle of this stashed away for my own old age!</div>

It was a light, tasty number, and I'll be sad to see the back of it.<br />I'd get another, except someone gave me a bottle of Green Spot last week, so I feel sorted for Summery whiskeys.</div>
