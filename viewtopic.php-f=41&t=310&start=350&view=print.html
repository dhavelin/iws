				<div class="content">I think that was a serious over inflated price. I remember seeing a Midleton distillery reserve bottle(dumpy bottle) getting £240 at an auction last year. <br /><br />I have seen lots of bottles sell at auction then pop up on Whisk(e)y shop sites later for well over the hammer. <br /><br />I can understand why the price in pubs are so high too John. It's so rare that each bottle opened ups the price. The current price of 1980's Redbreast is €400/500 in shops. It can still be found in certain bars for sale at standard prices. If they knew how rare it was it would be multiples more. The Mano A Lámh is way better whiskey too.</div>

There's on in the Whiskyauctioneer.com this week and I wonder will it fair as well. <br /><br />A Teeling 21 1st batch made €555, amazing. There's another this month. <br /><br />Jameson 15 got €322. A RVR got €252 which is good value for the quality I think. <br /><br />I've a tonne of results I've yet to post but will get there when I get a computer.

This may happen again in 6 mths time but again you need to look at the whole picture for a real value.<br /><br />Man o Lamh may yet be a very valuable bottle but you have to remember that this limited edition of 2000 took a very long time to sell out. This to me proves there is still a very limited market for Irish Whiskey but there is always a few willing to pay to get what they want and once that group is satiated the price falls dramatically.</div>

				<div class="content">If the seller was the original owner well £1 would have been a great. It's money for nothing after all. <br /><br />We guessed the reserve was £500. If it's not met this time it will be in the next auction. One of the Jamesons had a reserve too. It reached £300 but didn't sell either.</div>

It got £850 in told. That would amount to nearly €1500 when exchange rate, commission &amp; costs are factored in. It surprised me. I expected it to get £400/500.</div>
