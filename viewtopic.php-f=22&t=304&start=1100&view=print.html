				<div class="content">The Devils Cut has given me a taste for bourbon, so I decided to have some Jefferson Reserve. I never tried a whiskey that opens up so well with a drop of water. Not bad stuff for in front of the fire on a Wednesday night. I'm off for a few days therefore I can have more than one or two tonight. <br />Betting some practice in for the presidents tasting tomorrow night.</div>

				<div class="content">I do hope Yellow Spot makes it to Ontario (though am scared about the potential price if it does...)<br /><br />Last night involved a large pour of Four Roses Single Barrel for Binny's (Illinois liquor store chain) @ 55.8% using the OESQ recipe.  The banana note that is the signature of the yeast strain (the 'Q' in the recipe code) used in the bottling has worn off from the nose, but is still present in the palate.  It has been open for about 18 months, iirc and is still about 2/3 full...must experiment with adding water the next time I pour it.</div>

				<div class="content">Just draining the last of 2 bottles, an IB of Balmenach. A 26yo at cask strength, have always loved this distillery and the Deerhunter18yo used to be a firm favourite but not even sure it s still available any more.<br /><br />Now on Knappogue 1951, this really improved after being open for a while ... a rarity well worth trying but not sure it is worth the huge money that is asked of it. Patches of brilliance but there is also the woodiness with is a flaw.</div>

Have you tried the BBR 30 from Balmenach?  I keep meaning to order one, but something else always comes up.</div>

				<div class="content">Right now I'm having a bushmills select cask 12yo- the old one from heathrow with some rum cask in the mix. I opened this recently and didn't enjoy it at all and I'm not getting it tonight either. Yet this used to be a favourite - when this was regularly available I went through several bottles. So either this is a bad bottle or my tastes have changed I the few years since. Or come to think of it this was a whiskey I used to drink in summer - I remember putting a big dent in a bottle in my sisters back garden some years ago - I Had help! <br />So any thoughts is it bad bottle, tastes changing or a seasonal thing?</div>
