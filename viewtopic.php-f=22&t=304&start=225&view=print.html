				<div class="content">I know very little about beer production - I do know the beer was good and that;s probably enough. <br /><br />What I really meant was that I lot of people would probably make the same assumption as I did the first time I saw a beer labelled India Pale Ale. That it was made in India. Or if they say it in a glass that it was a lager.<br /><br />Good beer though. I relly like the Curim wheat beer too.</div>

				<div class="content">I think even casual beer drinkers (ok, maybe not the Bud and Heino set) know that IPA is a style and doesn't designate country of origin.<br />Oddly enough, India's probably the last place to make IPA, since the original style was developed so that the beer would keep in transit by ship from England to the colonies in the sub-continent. But the style was so good they never shipped it.<br />I recall one manufacturer running adds recently featuring an irate Indian man demanding that IPA beer be delivered at long last!<br />Anyhow, it's just a slightly stronger, slightly hoppier beer. But it's a great style and the Irish craft brewers are doing it some serious justice. I don't mind if they call it Irish Pale Ale to clarify where it comes from. They're small producers and need to make their name and develop their markets.</div>
