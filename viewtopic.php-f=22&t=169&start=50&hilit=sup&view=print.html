It also says its Scots for <span style="font-style: italic">a drop, dewdrop, distil, drizzle, drop</span>.  Personally I had never heard it until you brought it up though. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />   <br /><br /><br />PS its also Serbian for brown, but I'm not sure that's relevant.</div>

				<div class="content">What a fun thread! <br /><br />In the US, it's simple. Any spirits are measured by the &quot;shot&quot;. There are two &quot;shots&quot;, the smaller one is 1 fluid ounce (sometimes referred to as a &quot;jigger&quot;), the larger one is 1-1/2 ounces, always referred to as a shot. (Such as that Indian silver double measure mentioned early on).<br /><br />In the US, a 1-1/2 ounce &quot;shot&quot; is equal in alcohol to a &quot;glass of wine&quot;, and to 16 ounces of beer.<br /><br />Here in the US, most times spirits are ordered as &quot;Irish whiskey on the rocks&quot;, or &quot;Neat&quot;, which is served in an &quot;Old Fashioned&quot; glass. We don't order by the &quot;dram&quot; or any other term, must be a cultural shift. <br /><br />Do you folks on your side of the Atlantic &quot;release the angels&quot; (sprinkle a few drops of water over the drink) before drinking? I do that here and people look at me as if I had three heads.<br /><br />Gimme a shot of whiskey! (John Wayne style)</div>

				<div class="content">The distinction has to be made, when talking about whiskey in amounts smaller than a cask,between those terms describing measures of the spirit in legal and transactional situations (e.g.buying a whiskey in a bar) and the terms used in conversation in social and sociable situations (e.g. &quot;Will you have a dram or a drop of whiskey?)   Nothing relating to the size of the amount(measure) is implied in the latter,even when the prefix&quot;wee&quot; is used.  &quot;Wee&quot; here does not suggest size, but is rather a expression of endearment or affection - towards the whiskey, not the would-be recipient I hasten to add!  Phew! Just had to clarify that, otherwise I might never be able to offer/buy someone a drink- or vice versa.<br />So, when we go up to the bar we say to the barman &quot;A Black Bush please!&quot;, on certain occasions adding &quot;Make it a large one&quot; or &quot;Make it a double.&quot; That's all that needs to be said - nothing more.  Back at the table, having had a sip, we say &quot;That's a nice drop of whiskey.&quot;<br />For me &quot;drop&quot; is the appropriate conversational term in Ireland, understood by one and all.  &quot;Dram&quot; is too redolent of Scotland,though most certainly if I were in that country I would say &quot;Yes, I'd love a dram &quot; if it were proferred by a native. However,such occurrences are quite rare I have been told.<br />Slainte.</div>

				<div class="content">For me, I can never bring myself to say the word &quot;dram&quot;.  It sticks in my throat.<br /><br />For comparison, using the term &quot;dram&quot; in relation to whiskey in Ireland is akin to referring to &quot;violins&quot; at a trad session (rather than &quot;fiddles&quot;).  Same damn thing, but we're culturally atuned to referring to a fiddle, not a violin.  Similarly, a &quot;drop&quot; of whiskey rolls off the tongue.<br /><br />/M</div>
