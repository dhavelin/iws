				<div class="content">Found this old Jameson whiskey bottle in a crate in the attic, unopened. Belonged to my wife's grandfather. Guestimating it was bottled around the 60's. Anyone any info on T.W. Begge &amp; co on Bachelor's Walk? From what I can find is that they were a tea &amp; wine merchants. <br /><br />Any info on possible value too is appreciated. <br />It's a smaller bottle,so not the miniature, but the hipflask size you get in the off license kinda thing.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Steve,<br /><br />That's a nice find. Have you photos of it with a lighter background, It's difficult to see using a phone. Is it a driven cork? Is the capsule(gererally foil wrapping)intact?</div>

				<div class="content">Nice little bottle (a naggin), and looks original. <br /><br />This is an excellent curio and a nice piece of history, probably containing pot still from the original John's lane distillery.<br /><br />The actual bottler will not affect the value of this bottling as every retailer, wine merchant and pub bottled these in the day so unless it is a very famous establishment with a following no real affect on value.<br /><br />However this is something that collectors would be interested in but unfortunately I do not think it will be of any major value.<br /><br />Whiskey from this period is still fairly common and from that point of view the whiskey itself is not overly rare.<br /><br />So from a regular collectors point of view 30-50 Euro is my guesstimate but that is all it is ... a guess as I'm not sure on the collectablity of naggins.<br />However it could easily be a case that a minitures collector may have a bigger interest in it. Again unfortunately it may be too large for those collectors.<br /><br />An idea would be to contact the Celtic Whiskey shop to see what they say?</div>
