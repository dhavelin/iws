				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />I'll be meeting some fellow whiskey fans in downtown Toronto in about 10 days and was looking for suggestions as to which one (or two) from the Irish offerings on the below noted menu I should try:<br /><br /><a href="http://quinnssteakhouse.com/menus/Whiskey%20List%20Nov%202011.pdf" class="postlink">http://quinnssteakhouse.com/menus/Whiskey%20List%20Nov%202011.pdf</a><br /><br />Any and all suggestions are welcome.  I still consider myself a 'blank slate' when it comes to trying Irish whiskies.  I've only had Black Bush, Bushmills 1608, Tyrconnell Single Malt, Redbreast 12, Jamesons 18, Locke's 8, Green Spot, and Midleton Very Rare 2011 to date.  Thank you!</div>

				<div class="content">in a north american context, I'd usually say go for the green spot as its almost impossible to find in north america as a general rule and its brilliant stuff. But if you've already had it, it might be best to try something else. Redbreast 15 might be something new for you as its a highly sherried Single Pot Still and you'd already have the redbreast 12 for comparison so you might get more out of the experience. Tyrconnell port cask is delicious but can be found for a better price.</div>

				<div class="content">Yep Jameson Gold is a nice one all right. <br /><br />Redbreast 15 is great and looks like good value too.  (The Irishman 70 is lovely too)<br /><br />The Locke's 8yo is quite nice with a subtle hint of smoky peat in it. <br /><br />and if your tempted by a more peated Connemara then go for the cask Strength version which is the best of the pick for me. <br /><br />Stay away from Millar's Special Reserve or O'Kanagans Rare. Nothing special or rare about them  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks guys for all of the suggestions.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />  I will probably try two...one I can buy in Ontario (probably the Jameson Gold, maybe the Redbreast 15), and one that cannot be purchased around here, so it will be an extra treat (the Tyrconnell Port sounds like a nice one to 'splurge' on).  I'll let you guys know what I go with on Sunday.<br /><br />Thanks also to 'IWC' for the warnings about O'Kanagan and Millar's...I have seen the O'Kanagan kick around the LCBO stores on occasion and was a little curious about it.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all.  I got together with three other members from the Connosr forum who were in, or able to make it to, Toronto on Sunday.  I decided to splurge on the Tyrconnell Port Cask for my first dram, as it is definitely not available on a widespread basis in Ontario.  I have had a hit/miss relationship with Port Cask aged/finished whiskies.  Balvenie 1993 Port Wood (awesome!!!) and Balvenie 21 yo Port Wood (the OB that stemmed from the 1993 PW release) have been positives.  Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban has never really come together in the multiple tastings that I have had of it.  I found the Tyrconnell to be increasingly dominated by a minty/menthol type of note that started out nice, but then seemed to overwhelm the palate by the end.<br /><br />My second dram was the Jamesons Gold.  One of my tablemates immediately noted a cherry cola note on the nose, which I did not immediately pick up on.  However, on the first sip, this note was quite evident on the palate.  A liquid caramel note ran through the palate to the finish.  This dram continued to evolve to the sweet side as it sat in the glass.  By the time I had finished (after about 30-40 minutes) the sweet notes included candied fruits and cotton candy.  I really enjoyed this one, especially experiencing the evolution of the sweet notes.  It is being added to the wishlist.<br /><br />Thanks to all for your suggestions!   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />   I will refer to them for future opportunities to sample.  I neglectd to mention in my original post that I have indeed had a chance to try the Connemara Cask Strength on two occasions, and have greatly enjoyed it.  That bottle is on my wishlist to purchase in the future.</div>
