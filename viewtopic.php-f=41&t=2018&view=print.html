				<div class="content">Hi and welcome. If you can upload a photo using the UPLOAD ATTACHMENT tab that would help date your bottle and someone can give you some more info. Is it a 7 year old or the 12? This will be on the lower label. If this is missing the bottle shape my help.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it must be the 12 as it says &quot;Liqueur&quot;.<br /><br />If it's in good condition, it could go for between 250 euro and 400 euro, I'd say.</div>

				<div class="content">That's the one. I've one at home. <br />I got mine a few years ago for nearly  €200. <br /><br />If you check the archive on whiskyauctions.com you'll find the odd bottle. I haven't seen one for years. I think John's valuation is a fair one. Yours is in great condition so top value. It'll only appreciate too.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear reader,<br /><br />about 35 years ago I bought a few of these bottle in a wine shop in the Netherlands. I still have 3 or 4 of them. without a duty free stamp, because it was sold legally in the shop. they said they found these bottles in the cellar and as a wine shop, they wanted not to sell these liqueurs. <br /><br />What would a bottle cost now?<br /><br />On the photo (which didn't upload) the one who lost content, the others are completely full.<br /><br />Ron</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ron,<br /><br />I can post those photos for you, I'll send you my email address in a Private Message.<br /><br />The value would be from €250-400 depending on condition. They would retail for more. Shops have overheads and VAT to pay so they'll be pricing that in.<br /><br />You could search <a href="http://whiskyauction.com/" class="postlink">WhiskyAuctions</a> for a recent auction price.</div>
