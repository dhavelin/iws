				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JakeDPR wrote:</cite>Is it hard to get Japanese Whisky here in the states? I have never seen any</div></blockquote><br /><br />There is not much out there 'JakeDPR'.  Check some of the large retailer websites (i.e. Binny's in IL, K&amp;L Wines and Beltramo's in CA) to see what is available.  I was fortunate enough to get a bottle of Yamazaki 18 from Binny's in early May for $90, which is a very good price for that bottle.  <br /><br />If you can get to Maryland, their county liquor store system is quite well priced...for example, Montgomery County:<br /><br /><a href="http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/dlctmpl.asp?url=/content/dlc/liquor/home/index.asp" class="postlink">http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/dlctmpl.asp?url=/content/dlc/liquor/home/index.asp</a><br /><br />Though their Yamazaki 18 is more expensive than Binny's...it would appear that their Japanese whisky selection is limited to Yamazaki 12 &amp; 18 (though you should use the product name search if you have something specific in mind to check).</div>

				<div class="content">I enjoyed a lovely George T Stagg (2011).  At 71.3% this one requires water.  I found that a 4:1 whiskey:water ratio does the trick of simmering down the alcohol, while really bringing the excellent profile to the forefront. yum!!</div>

To get in the 'spirit' of the shows characters and settings, I had a drink of Redbreast 12, followed by the Old Potrero 18th Century (yes, the whisky &quot;pre-dates&quot; the show by a good 65 years) Style Rye whiskey.  Both awesome, and fitting, for the show.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
