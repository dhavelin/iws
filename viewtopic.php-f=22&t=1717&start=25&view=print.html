He claimed it was a waste of a glass bottle. <br /> <br />I just finished a bottle of Tullamore DEW, Kilbeggan and Beam's Devils Cut. I'd been mixing them and enjoyed the results. I was working for St. Patrick's and am making up for lost time. <br />There's a bottle of Booker's that needs addressing.</div>

The only place I buy whiskey from...<br /><br />Good to hear that the 21 year old was well received in Dingle. That was a very special and rare pre-release bottle.  My friend in the warehouse tells me that they will be running the first bottles down the line in the next few weeks.  With a little luck you should see the TWC 21yr in shops this summer.</div>

				<div class="content">6 more bit the dust last night at a neighbourhood BBQ<br />1) Powers NAS - there was much early demand for hot whiskeys, and Power's is best IMHO - had to use Jameson for the remaining ones.<br />2) Bowmore 1989, 16yo, 51.8% - a bit too perfumey in its final months in bottle, but a favourite in its early days.<br />3) Bruichladdich &quot;Peat&quot; , 46% - I never really liked this one - a bit buttery<br />4) Blackadder Tormor Raw Cask, Dist 1990, 66.2% - light and fruity<br />5) Aberlour 100 proof - very sherried and lasted the pace well - tasted much nicer outdoors that I recall indoors!<br />6) Locke's &quot;Grand Crew&quot; cask 696, 59.4% - a favourite!<br />/M</div>

Next to go are likely mini bottles of Yoichi 10 and Alberta Premium.  Trying to get to less than 30 open bottles, but something always seems to get popped open every month or two.  Laphroaig Cairdeas and Rowan's Creek Bourbon are likely to be cracked open in the next month.</div>
