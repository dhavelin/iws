				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />    HAPPY NEW YEAR to all IWS members!  Yesterday, I visited my local Liquor Store here in Maine.<br />I spied something new on the shelf, a one liter bottle of BARTON Irish Whiskey.  Ummmm....<br />This is a brand I've never heard of before.  I suspect BARTON is going to be.....(how shall I say).....<br />&quot;Entry level&quot; at best considering it's one liter size and twenty dollar (on sale) price.  Then again, one never knows how good (or bad) it might be until one gives it a try.  A Google search provided no information on Barton Irish Whiskey.  <br />So, might any IWS member have any information about BARTON Irish Whiskey ?  Thanks.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">There is a Barton brand out there though. According to <a href="http://www.bartonbrands.com/category.htm" class="postlink">the website</a> it already covers American and Canadian whiskeys, as well as rum, brandy... So an Irish whiskey wouldn't be a stretch.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there sixcats,<br /><br />It is most likely a Cooley blend of single malt and grain, however we cannot confirm that yet.. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.shopmerwins.com/3193so.html">http://www.shopmerwins.com/3193so.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Be the first to review it, if it is a Cooley Blend it will be soft, citrus, honey &amp; easy drinking.<br /><br />A softer version of the Kilbeggan I would imagine.</div>

				<div class="content">From Cooley's 2009 Annual Report:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In partnership with our US Importer Sazerac, we launched a new Irish whiskey under the &quot;Barton's&quot; brand. This is aimed solely at the on-trade as a &quot;well&quot; Irish whiskey rather than a branded call. Most Barton expressions, be it vodka, Scotch whisky or gin, sell in very high volume.</div></blockquote><br /><br />So it's unexpected, perhaps, for SixCats to find it in a liquor store. It's just meant to be the default &quot;Irish whiskey&quot; in a bar when no brand is specified. At least that's how I read the above quote.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Gentleman and Happy New Year!<br /><br />   Thank you very much John, Dave and WBro.  Ahhhh, that link does show the same Barton that is available in Maine.<br /> I will take a chance and buy a bottle of Barton Irish Whiskey soon.  I didn't realize Kilbeggan was a Cooley Whiskey.<br />Heck, at the cost of about $20.00 U.S. for a one liter bottle, even if it's halfway decent Whiskey, I would think it would be a good buy!  My current LEAST expensive favorite Whiskey (available in Maine) is in fact Kilbeggan (old label).  It will be fun to compare Barton vs. Kilbeggan.  A New Years project!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />    Today I received a reply to an inquiry I made regarding BARTON Irish Whiskey.<br />According to a Consumer Affairs Associate of BUFFALO TRACE Distillery, BARTON is indeed a COOLEY four year old Irish Whiskey and it is bottled in the U.S. <br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

Also, whiskycast cites the Irish Whiskey Society Twitter for its info... Or at least news of its release.</div>

				<div class="content">I yes I forgot about that, I tweeted way back in October about Barton's, the info came from Cooley's annual report which is usually published around September. Mark Gillespie from Whisky Cast contacted me to confirm the info and he in turn confirmed with Barton's as nothing had been heard the other side of the atlantic. (Mystery solved I hope).<br /><br />See you should follow the IrishWhiskeySociety on twitter for the breaking news, events and latest deals !!!! <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/IrishWhiskeySoc">http://twitter.com/IrishWhiskeySoc</a><!-- m --></div>

I suppose that is why they are called independent bottlers  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Also I have a feeling that the mysterious &quot;Erin Go Bragh&quot; was bottled outside of IDL control but I can't be sure.</div>

It doesn't even have to be a private label. There is no reason Jameson, say, could not be bottled in the US (it isn't though).</div>
