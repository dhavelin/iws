				<div class="content">Thanks for the picks<br /><br />Wanted to see the Redbreast but noticed something strange about the Jameson 15yo. I have 2 of these and both are different versions. 1 is the Millennium Limited edition and the other is a Pre millennium edition with a slightly plainer main label. However both have the small oval green crest label just above the the main label stating the bottle number. However the one pictured above has a totally different crest label which is actually a crest label for the original Jameson Gold which originally came in this style bottle too. So this may not be what it's purporting to be.<br /><br />Very odd  <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" />  Where did you source this bottle  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />As suggested, please see attached a shot of the rear label of the 15 year old. I can't remember how I got it when in IDL but unless I got it as a gift at some stage it must have come out of the shop.

(more than the other in fact)</div></blockquote><br /><br />It could well be. If someone bought it and had a spare box it could be. The reason for the higher bids is the condition of the box, I'm guessing. <br /><br />There's 3 5fl oz Redbreasts that are not doing as well as the 4 ordinary miniatures(1 rarish). I wonder do people realise what size they are. I would have valued them at a 1/5 the price of a full bottle. A full 70's bottle got €404 in the last Whiskyauction.com auction. I would have said that was overpriced. If estimated the 5oz to be worth 40/50 anyway. We'll have to wait and see.</div>
