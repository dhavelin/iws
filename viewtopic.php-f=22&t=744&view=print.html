				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   Well, somewhere posted here at The Irish Whiskey Society, IWC said something to the effect that I have to be careful as I have COLLECTING in my blood.  IWC was indeed correct.  Last week, I bought TEACHERS HIGHLAND CREAM.  Yesterday, I bought (a repeat buy) of BLACK BUSH.  Today...I drove to The State of New Hampshire State Liquor Store and bought yet another BLACK BUSH (seven dollars less in NH) and a bottle of JAMESON 12<br />(which is a whooping FIFTEEN dollars less expensive in NH vs. Maine).  Mind you, I am not drinking all now but rather putting away half of what I buy until Fall.  JC, I tried man, but, I just couldn't bring myself to buy only ONE expensive bottle Scotch vs. two good bottles of Irish after driving all the way to NH.  I swear, I will buy that LAGAVULIN 16 or such &quot;higher quality&quot; Scotch before too long.  I had some extra money due to the fact that I recently sold some of my Vintage Audio gear.  Of course, my wife got the bulk of the cash from the sale.  However, the wife doesn't know I pocketed enough money for Whiskey.  My collection as of today :  (2) Redbreast, (2) Jameson 12, (2) BLACK BUSH,  a single of Highland Park 12, Ardbeg 10.  Opened : Black Bush (nearly gone), &quot;The Irishman&quot;, Teachers HLC, Tamdhu 10, The Famous Grouse Gold Reserve.  Yikes, that's 13 bottles since Mothers Day (May 9th.) Uh Oh, me thinks I've got a problem!   Well, I DID give up going out to Restaurants, buying Coffee in the morning, etc.  I'm having more fun collecting (and drinking) Whiskey/Whisky.<br />Am I the only one who is this out of control buying/collecting ?<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

Also helps prevent getting burned.<br /><br />Personally I think we should have a 5th heading on the main page just devoted to our thoughts on Britney. I remember drinking one evening in a pub in carrick on suir and th music that was playing alternated all night between one Clancy brothers song and one Britney Spears song. I was trying to work out what album they were playing - maybe &quot;The Best Liam Clancy and Britney Spears album in the world.....Ever, Vol.2&quot; or &quot;Now that's what I call music by the Clancys and Britney. Vol 4.&quot;</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   Now, this is funny!  Talk about off topic.  Seriously, I didn't even know that the title/heading I wrote was a Brittany Spears song.  I mean, yes, I have heard that song but, being an older Fart, I had zero idea who sang that song.  I'm not one much for Pop Culture.  My taste in music is classic Jazz (listening to Miles &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;) as I type.  I also love 1960 &amp; 70's Rock, Blues and light Classical.  Back on topic, I think I can answer my own question now.  Yes indeed!  I do believe I have a serious COLLECTING problem.  Mind you, not a drinking problem (at least yet) but I like to Collect certain things and now it's Whiskey &amp; Whisky.  So, I plan on heading back down to NH tomorrow and make yet another purchase.  I figure that since Jameson 12 is fifteen dollars less a bottle in NH than Maine, perhaps it would make sense to by yet another Jameson 12, no ?  Heck, I had better open one of my Jameson 12 tonight and have a dram before committing to a THIRD bottle.  You can rest assure that even if I didn't love it, I will drink every last drop regardless.  At any rate, if I have enough pocket money, perhaps I'll buy a Laphroaig which is a bit more expensive than the Irish Whiskey.  Bush Black, The Irishman, Tullamore Dew 12 and Jameson 12 are all close in price.<br />Gotta buy something!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Ah ha!  &quot;The Irishman Original Clan&quot; is once again back to it's $27.99 (no tax) price in NH.  Sweeeeet!<br />Perhaps I'll buy a bottle of &quot;The Irishman&quot; and a bottle of Powers!  Or...or...I did just open an pour myself a dram of JAMESON 12.  Damn fine Whiskey!  I realize that I am a newbie regarding tasting Irish Whiskey but, this much I can say...I have now tasted Redbreast, Black Bush, Powers, Jameson 12 and &quot;The Irishman&quot;.  I believe that each and every single one of the five are OUTSTANDING Irish Whiskeys!  I would say that one isn't necessary better than the other, just different.  I really think it just depends on ones mood which is prefered.<br />I enjoy (from time to time) a nice big bowl of quality Ice Cream.  I enjoy Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry &amp; Coffee.  Each unique but equally good (in my book).  I have quickly learned that once you reach a certain level of quality in Irish Whiskey, taste becomes rather subjective.  Perhaps I would rate (regular) POWERS a bit &quot;lesser&quot; than the other four I've listed but still, quite good, especially considering it's much lower price.  I would rate Jameson 12, Black Bush and &quot;The Irishman&quot; damn near equal in quality.  These three are (U.S.) priced very close together.  Redbreast is a bit more expensive.  I killed my first bottle of Redbreast rather quickly.  I have put two more away.  Considering the lower price of Jameson 12, Black Bush and &quot;The Irishman&quot;, it may be awhile before I spent the extra money on Redbreast.  Wow, I have to decide which I prefer for a repeat buy tomorrow...Jameson 12, <br />Black Bush or &quot;The Irishman&quot;.  Tough call!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi IWC,<br /><br />   Man, I just can't resist a sale ($27.99 a 750ml) especially when &quot;The Irishman&quot; is so difficult to find in New England.  If I'm not mistaken, NH may be the only New England State who carries &quot;The Irishman&quot;.<br />Next trip, more Black Bush and Jameson 12...unless Redbreast is on sale.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>
