				<div class="content">Cross post from Bargain Buys: Has anyone any idea what the Aldi Glen Marnoch 24 year old is?  Only €39.99 but was released last Thursday so may be all gone, going to check tomorrow.  I see the 12 year old was allegedly D*lm*r*, and another under this name was allegedly Gl*nm*r*ng** (names hidden in case not right but you may guess what they are).</div>

				<div class="content">I can't answer that, but I did Google some reviews when I got the Aldi email. They are pretty negative so I didn't pursue it any further.<br /><br />I bought the Lidl Scotch whisky marmalade that's in their Deluxe Christmas range. I like it, but it doesn't taste of whisky.</div>

				<div class="content">The Dalmore and Glenmorangie rumours are from a few years ago. Even if they were true then, there is little chance the same distilleries are still used. A well kept secret and, afaik, no one knows.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><br />Staying with Aldi their 1973 Vintage Napoleon Brandy (39yo) looks intriguing at £24.99. I grabbed the last two in my local branch, one to try and one as a gift, i confess to not liking brandy but... I also grabbed two Offley 30yo Tawny Ports for my better half at £30 each, another bargain. One bottle of El Dorado 15yo rum for £35.</div>

				<div class="content">The Glen Marnoch is a 24yo Speyside distilled in 1988, 40% abv, bought one of two that were remaining on the shelf in Sandyford.<br /><br />The distillery concerned is a closely guarded secret, speculation is that it might be a Dalmore, wishful thinking suggests a Glenmorangie or  Glenfarclas.<br /><br />Reviews mixed, lowdown suggests that it is inoffensive and worth a go! <br /><br />This years bottling is a bourbon cask so that rules out Glenfarclas...<br /><br />Review: Typical generic Speyside, <br /><br />Nose: citrus, candy, grassy think older Tyrconnel<br />Taste: quite spirity for 40% abv, dry, creamy, biscuity, slightly bitter<br />Finish: Astringent &amp; bitter, dry but light, <br /><br />Verdict: Passable but no vanilla explosion</div>
