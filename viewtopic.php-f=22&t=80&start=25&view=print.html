				<div class="content">Just a quick note on these so called books as there seem to be a few with different titles ... if you see Books LLC with these long winded titles do not purchase unless you know exactly what you are getting. Basically these are print companies that source a batch of wiki pages on the same subject which as you may or may not know are free of copyright. So basically these are print outs of WIki-Pedia topics from information that is freely available on the internet. They are actually fairly nicely edited and laid out but the information in regards to Irish Whiskey in particular is usually fairly basic. <br /><br /><br />And they do pretty much all look like this.<br /><br /><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gd9glCu5L._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">i have seen some of these on amazon, with long titles inc. Jameson, Bushmills, Locke's, Powers and so on, but it was a bit scary, because there was no named author or editor.<br /><br />i think i have asked somewhere else on the forum if anyone know these, but no reply<br /><br />but here you go, someone just trying to get money for literally nothing<br /><br />lucky me, i did not bought it</div>

				<div class="content">101 Whiskies To Try Before You Die by Ian Buxton<br /><br />Hi got this new book last week and I have to say it would be a good book for anyone who is beginning to explore scotch and other whiskies, or for someone looking to branch out and try new whiskies. Clear and well written with a sense of humour and informative.<br /><br />Currently £8.44 on amazon.co.uk versus RRP  of £12.99<br /><br />In Ireland ir is €15.60 in Hodges &amp; Figgis and €17+ in Easons afaik.</div>

				<div class="content">Got this too. It's very good, I think. Tasting notes are nice and simple, the way they should be. Think he could have had Connemara in there, though. <br /><br />Dave Broom is releasing a World Atlas of Whisky soon. I've pre ordered it on Amazon. Might be something similar to the Whisky Bible, a new edition of which is out next month.</div>

				<div class="content">I got that a few days ago - good book. Some similarities to Michael Jackson's world whiskey book in terms of the geographic tour of Scottish distilleries - the Irish chapter a little shorter I think but well worth a read, the Japanese one quite comprehensive. Interesting enough system of linking taste profiles betwwen different whiskeys. I think Dave Broom wrote the Japanese chapter in Michael Jackson's book but I could be wrong - I can't find the book to check.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm getting through a bit more of the Dave Broom book - some quite new and interesting approaches - and I say that as someone with lots of whisky books.

Also interesting, in the context of the discussion in another topic on Connemara Turf Mor (how do I add the sine fada again?), he talks about how the amount of peat coming through to the end product can vary greatly depending on the fermantation time, which part of the cut is taken etc. So the higher or lower ppm isn't the only factor. Also interesting is that there are different elements to the phenols and that even at the same ppm there are different compounds from floor maltings that drum maltings that have an impact.<br /><br />Interesting stuff, in a nerdy way!</div>
