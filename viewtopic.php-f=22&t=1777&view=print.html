				<div class="content">This topic may have been discussed already, but I couldn't find it.<br /><br />As best as I can tell the historic spelling of whisky in Ireland is without the e.  Even Dublin's big four spelled it without the e when Truths About Whisky was published in 1879.  By the early 1900s they all seem to have shifted to whiskey.  I have read that this was a decision taken to differentiate Dublin Whiskey from 'the rest.'  However, I have seen some very old adverts from Bushmills that tend to indicate that it adopted the e quite early, but Bushmills seems like it may have been an exception along with the Glen distillery in Co. Cork.<br /><br />As best as I can tell all in this list are pre-1950s.<br /><br />Whisky:<br />Coleraine<br />Allman's<br />All Belfast Brands<br />Cork Distilleries<br />Persse's<br />Watts brands (Londonderry)<br /><br />Whiskey:<br />John Jameson<br />John Powers<br />George Roe<br />William Jameson<br />Cassidy's (Monasterevin)<br />Bushmills<br />Old Comber<br />Tullamore <br /><br />Can anyone shed any light on this mystery? <br />Once I have won the lottery and open my distillery I shall call it whisky.  Then I can say it is the only true Irish whisky.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Joel1802 wrote:</cite>Even Dublin's big four spelled it without the e when Truths About Whisky was published in 1879.</div></blockquote><br />Well, that's just the title of the book. You can see from the labels reproduced in the back that Roe, for example, favoured &quot;whiskey&quot;.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Once I have won the lottery and open my distillery I shall call it whisky.  Then I can say it is the only true Irish whisky.</div></blockquote><br />That would be a pity, I think. It's just an accident of history that we have ended up with &quot;whiskey&quot; and the Scots with &quot;whisky&quot; but now that we have it it is a nice distinction, one that everyone around the world latches on to as their favourite fact about Irish whiskey. I'm afraid, though, that various Irish whiskey producers (and even the Irish Whiskey Society) have begun to abandon the convention by writing &quot;whiskies&quot; when they should write &quot;whiskeys&quot;. It is even appearing on bottle labels. Given that spelling's strong association with Scotch I feel it's an &quot;admission&quot; that Irish whiskey is not the real deal and is trying to score some legitimacy by riding Scotch's coat tails. It's a lack of self-confidence.</div>

Or perhaps open one in Scotland and use the e.  That'd get a reaction, I'm sure. <br /><br />Thanks for pointing Roe out, I hadn't gotten there yet.

				<div class="content">Could they do that? Their legal definition might apply to whisky only, so while they would say whiskey is a different product, they might not be able to stop its sale, should they wish. <br /><br />I wonder if their rules apply to Scotch whisky, rather than whiskey, could people start selling stuff like the Hybrid release as whiskey in Scotland?<br /><br />I'm confusing myself now.</div>

				<div class="content">Good to see you diving in Joel, Irish Whiskey History is a maze and can be very hard to figure out at times.<br /><br />However just one word of caution when referring to old text as it is something I had done too until I heard a reference to spelling differences in relation to something completely different. It applies to names too so one needs to be aware of the possible reasons why it may be different. The spelling issue a lot of the time depended on the author and not the product. Therefore if you had a distillery that spelt their product Whisky there was a possibility that it would be described as Whiskey. There is definitely a thread already hear about it somewhere so I'll try and dig it out.<br /><br />But the precedence has been historically in Ireland that it was spelt both ways and it was as common in Cork as it was in the north. The mention of the Dublin whiskey starting it has been mentioned before too. Who knows though.<br /><br />Irish Whisky<br /><br />... why not  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>Could they do that? Their legal definition might apply to whisky only, so while they would say whiskey is a different product...</div></blockquote><br />I'm just speculating wildly here, of course, so take anything I say with a pinch of salte (as I prefer to spell it). If someone in Scotland decided to sell vodka as &quot;whiskey&quot; or &quot;whiskee&quot; I would bet money they would be stomped on pretty sharply. I don't believe it would be regarded as a different product because it is obviously intended to create confusion in the mind of the consumer.<br /><br />However, if a Scottish company decided to sell something that legally qualifies as whisky but labelled &quot;whiskey&quot;, I'd have a harder time identifying what exactly the infringement was.<br /><br />Ultimately, I just think it's in the industry's own interests to all row the same way. It magnifies the consumer perception of the product. That's why they have an SWA, after all.</div>
