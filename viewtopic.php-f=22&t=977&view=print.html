				<div class="content">Hey guys,<br /><br />I've just been to my local Lidl here in Wales and saw that they have a few Whiskies on sale.<br /><br />The one that stands out is a Maxwell 28 Year Old Highland Single Malt. It is £29.99 and the description is: &quot;This fine single malt has lain untouched in oak casks for 28 years to produce and outstanding whisky with a soft, sweet taste with a subtle kick of spice and citrus in its long lingering finish. 70cl 40%<br /><br />Another is an 18 Year Old Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky. Description: This classic single malt has an elegant, refined nose, warm flavours of grape, cinnamon and hints of ginger and nutmet. 70cl 40%. <br /><br />Tobermory 10 Year Old Single Malt. Description: A light amber whisky with a smooth, fruity taste and a rich, well-rounded finish. 70cl 40%<br /><br />Langs 5 Year Old Supreme Blended Scotch Whisky. Description: This whisky has a unique, gentle style and smooth creamy taste. 70cl 40%<br /><br />And for an Irish:<br /><br />Dundalgan 8 Year Old Blended Irish Whiskey. Description: Mellow with hints of vanilla, caramel and citrus fruits. 70cl 40%<br /><br />I've tried a Speyside 12 year old from Lidl earlier in the year. It wasn't too bad; not as peaty as most Scotch I've tasted. I don't have any tasting notes but I do wonder how the 18 year old tastes.<br /><br />Anyone have any information on these? The 28 year old seems like a great offer for the price.<br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br />Graham.</div>

				<div class="content">The don't seem to have the 28 yr old in Ireland. At least, I went in and didn't see it there - nor did I see it advertised. I went in looking for it. They have the 18 yr old, I think.<br /><br />I heard the 28 might be a Tamnavulin. Speculation, of course.</div>

				<div class="content">The Maxwell is a tempting offer. But it wont be world class. I held some in my hand the other day and didn't purchase, i reckoned that £30 could be spent elsewhere. There is more to good whisky than just age, and £30 will buy better ( admittedly younger ) whisky. Past offerings such as this - for me - have been disappointing. How good or average would a 28 yo whisky be before it's sold off anonymously by a cheap supermarket? I await opinions on the whisky itself. My guess is it's a Teaninich or similar which is capable of very good whisky though.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think it's collectable 'investment wise'. That will depend on the distillery - it would have to be a collectors distillery, which it probably isn't, hence the price and anonymity. I'm certain it would just about hold it's value at least.</div>

				<div class="content">well, i do not really call any distillery a collector distillery, i would just call collectible whisky and whiskey from a distillery<br /><br />however in my terms there are whisk(e)ys coming out from certain distillery, and those may be closed and they are very collectible, because they may not be open again, and those whiskeys are old stocks, usually limited, can be single casks and bottles are numbered, just to give one example; Port Ellen<br /><br />but from the same land Islay, there is Ardbeg with their special single casks, and committee bottling, they are also sought after and one they are sold from the distillery they double triple their price on auctions, they are also limited one of bottlings<br />but at the same time their standard say 10 years old, i think never be a high value collectible item<br />same as Bowmore with their special very old bottlings selling for thousand each will be good inveatments, but a bottle of Bowmore 12 will not make too much <br /><br />same here with Midleton, the very rare yearly series are the most collectible Irish whiskey, also numbered each year, and there is rarities like 1973, 20Th Anniversary, Dungourney also limited, numbered one off whiskeys, and they will increase value, but the Paddy and Jameson, Powers will not worth much more 50 years time than today</div>

				<div class="content">going back to the main content of this thread<br /><br />the Dundalgan with no age statement, i believe was bottled at the same time as the 8 years old version seeing the codes on it<br /><br />says on the front; gold shield special reserve aged in wood, from the emerald isle<br /><br />on the back; Dundalgan &quot;premium&quot; irish whiskey is matured in oak casks to create a superb full bodied flavour<br />and specially produced for lidl ireland<br /><br /><br />the Dundalgan 8 years old says finest blended special reserve aged in wood on front<br /><br />on the back; this Dundalgan blended irish whiskey uses only a selection of the finest whiskeys that have been carefully matured in oak casks for at least 8 long years. our master blenders have &quot;married&quot; these individual blends to create to create a beatifully mellow whiskey with hints of vanilla, caramel and citrus fruits. a whiskey as unique as ireland itself<br />thisone have the uk unit chart and drinkavare.co.uk , and lidl uk and ireland</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not entirely sure the likes of the Midleton 1973 will go up in value - not if you buy them at today's retail prices. Maybe in 15 yrs or something like that. If one went for auction now, for example, it would not even make its original retail price - €1,400 or whatever it was. It's likely to go for less than half that. <br /><br />I also think some Ardbeg 10s will go up in value. There are lots of them around, but they ones made pre-LVMH might go up in value. I'm not sure if this is the case, but it's said that because the distillery was closed for a short period and was only making a limited amount on other years, there are older whiskys in that 10 yr old (as there usually is with malts). Anyway, they're good to drink. <br /><br />Karuizawa seems to increase rapidly in value once the bottles are sold out, particularly the Noh series.<br /><br />Then there's Brora, Rosebank (still good value, though) and Port Ellen. GlenDronach single casks seem to go down a bomb too. Older Bowmores and Macallans...</div>
