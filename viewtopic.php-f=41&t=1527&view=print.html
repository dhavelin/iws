				<div class="content">Would really need to see a picture as it was bottled as Gilbeys up until the early 80's<br /><br />Look forward to seeing it if you can manage it. Probably will not make much a difference on value whether 1964 up to early 80's.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it from the 60's. I have one from the 70's and 80's and they have a different labels. I paid €80 each for mine about 2 years ago and got 4 in total. 3 from the 80's and one 70's I think. I'd like to try this one because it should be better than the ones i have. I believe IWC told me that mine came from the time when Irish Distillers had stopped supplying whiskey to Gilbeys and they spent too long in the timber and thus had a slight spent feel but for a better description. I guess they would be worth €100-€200 today at auction.<br />I know their is one in CWS for €299, it says 70's but i'd have though later too. Again that's retail and I've made the mistake of over estimating things before when i see retail prices.<br />I now use the guide €100= 60(cost)15(profit)25(vat). That would put it about €180. Of course I stand to be corrected.</div>

I also could nearly guarantee you that if I wanted to buy another one of these I will be able to locate one with in the next 6months for under €150. <br /><br />I always try to give fair estimates to cover both the seller and the buyer as I don't buy on here but if the seller gets more due to demand then well done.

Certainly rare(ish) but these are certainly not worth more than €200 and again I would say closer to €150.<br /><br />So all I'll say is a word of warning to all new Irish Whiskey Collectors is be very careful on attributing values to what a specialist retailer and once off auction sales dictate. These prices can very easily distort the actual value. The Irish Whiskey Collectors circle is minuscule and once a few have been sold the market is gone. <br /><br />The Jameson Millions or what ever they call it is a prime example of this. Ally was selling one for €500 and now another is €600 a bottle. However this is a totally notional value and once these start to appear on ebay more regular the value will plummet, and they will, as there are at least 1500 in existence (if not double that). I reckon that either you will have a load on ebay that don't sell because of over inflated prices or they will be lucky to fetch €100. <br /><br />At the end of the day it is just my personal opinion and that's all it ever can be but I've been at this game long enough to know not to get stung by panic buying just because something rare comes along and I hope that I can prevent others getting stung. A collector needs to know what is rare and what is not and I can say for fairly certain that Redbreasts like this are not as rare as people like to believe.</div>
