				<div class="content">Anyone receive this magazine? I ordered the first issue on March 30th and it never arrived. Followed up May 3rd and was promised a replacement which has yet to arrive. Just noticed the second edition is out but shame on me if I throw away more money for something that will never arrive. Anyone have any luck getting it delivered to America? Is the magazine any good? Worth the price?</div>

				<div class="content">Well, I did get the second issue in the mail today.  I never ordered the second so I guess that's in lieu of the first, which I'm guessing is sold out.  There's a lot packed in there!  I'm impressed.</div>
