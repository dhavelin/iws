				<div class="content">&quot;Pot Still Single Malt&quot; i hope we dont have another 'early Cooley' labeling fiasco in the making. I've been trying to figure out since they started what they plan on doing. First i heard they want to make pot still but then their brochure only mentioned single malt but then i read a comment from MacDougall mentioning both &quot;single malt&quot; and &quot;Irish pot still.&quot; If someone can clear that up on Thursday, i'd be hugely obliged. I hope they dont go down the &quot;malt is made in a pot still and is therefore legally 'Irish pot still'&quot; route...</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, I tried pinning them down too but I was told &quot;single malt pot still&quot;. If I was starting my own distillery though, I'd keep my options open, try both (maybe even a peated pot still <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> and see what came out well. So it'll probably all come out in the wash (ha ha).<br /><br />Did you notice, by the way, that Tullamore Dew has stated its intention to release SPS whiskey from its new distillery? I mentioned it in a recent blog post.</div>

				<div class="content">When I was down there a few weeks ago, they said it will initially be Single Malt. And no estimate could be given for doing SPS so I reckon the Pot Still is down the road a bit but you never know.<br /><br />Peter who is heading up the operation is first and foremost a Brewer and probably needs to find his way a bit under the grand tutelage of Master Distiller John McDougall. He has already done a good job on the gin so I don't think it will take him too long to get to grips with the distillation part but Single Malt initially is more straight forward.</div>

				<div class="content">well then let them doubley know  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />similarly, if any of them confirm that they do intend to make sps within the next year, would you do me a grand favour and tell them i'm looking to speak to them about a book on sps revival... I spoke to Oliver Hughes briefly a while back but, again, it was unclear whether or not they were making the stuff. If they do commit to it, i'd be very interested in including them in the project. Thanks David!</div>

				<div class="content">You can let them know that I'm none too pleased about the mis-leading use of Pot Still too.  Why do so many in Ireland seem so keen to distil Malt?  Why be just another one in the herd when you could do something special and (currently) unique to Ireland?   <br /><br />Harumph.</div>

				<div class="content">Very enjoyable night had by all and sundry. Approx. 200 people in attendance. A couple <br />of Trad. musicians created a nice atmosphere. The Distillery is as the Americans would say 'Quaint'<br />in a nice way. One wall is dominated by the names of the 'Founding Fathers'. <br />Those in attendance had a chance to sample the Dingle Gin and the Vodka. Tried the Gin and very much enjoyed. <br />The graphics on the Gin advertising is very effective with the Fuchsia very much emphasized. This native <br />plant of South America is now very much a symbol of West Cork and Kerry  !!! If the Gin is anything to go<br />by then the Whiskey will be worth the wait. Hopefully they will not rush to market with the 'Irish Oak wood <br />matured ' effort tried in other places !!</div>
