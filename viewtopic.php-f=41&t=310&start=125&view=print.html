Basically it is a fairly straight forward issue in one way. Customs may intercept your package and then let it go through An Post and for you to be able to take receipt of package you have to pay the duty &amp; Vat plus a handling charge.<br /><br />This is the legal duty of anyone buying and importing goods from outside the EU.<br /><br />I've noticed that the Midlands Customs office which my post goes through are very much on the ball and my last 3 or 4 bottles from the US have arrived with Duty charges, so you should expect to have to pay you duty &amp; Vat charges when making such purchases.</div>

But yes for general sales Joe Soap is not allowed to sell regular bottles unless they are &quot;Collectable&quot; containers ?!?!?!?. Which I have always found as a week loop hole any way.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br /><br />On the Old Donegal, seen quite a few over the years so I would imagine they are fine and I think I've seen adverts for them too so in my mind fine. There really are a myriad of unattributable brands from the days of old out there but I don't put much value on them unless you can verify distillery of origin. I would imagine there are hundreds of different brands. Quite a lot from England and Scotland too.<br /><br />The one on ebay is from the Irish Free state era so very easily dated to a 3 or 4 year period circa 1934 -1937.<br /><br />Reason being is this is a US bottle so Prohibition has a bearing. Congress passed the &quot;Volstead Act&quot; on October 28, 1919, <br />This came into Law 17th Jan 1920 and  repealed on December 5, 1933.<br /><br />However the Irish Free state was 6th Dec 1922- 29th Dec 1937. So this particular bottle must of only been legally imported after repeal.<br /><br />Giving us dates of  December 5, 1933 till 29th Dec 1937.</div>

However if your getting higher prices at Kruger's it is possibly worth selling through Whisky Auction. If you take a regular auction house then the fees seem to be either 15% or 20% plus vat on those payments. However a lot of auction houses do not charge on the balance over 2 grand. So if you sell something for €3500 you only pay on €2000. However you need to ask as these charges can be different from auction house to auction house.</div>
