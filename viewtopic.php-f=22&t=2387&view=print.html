				<div class="content">This will be an interesting year for Irish whiskey. For the first time in generations we could have Whiskeys from more than the big 3. Both Alltech and Dingle have stock that could be legally sold this year. Both were distilling in November 2012. <br /><br />Midleton didn't released the promised 3 SPS's so I'm assuming they will make amends this year. We should have the Red Spot very soon. <br />I'm assuming a Jameson Pot Still will be introduced. <br />I expect a couple of single cask Midleton's. <br /><br />I have been hoping for a new brand, a Dungourney perhaps to add to the Dungourney 1964 legacy. I'd like to see some old labels reintroduced like Hewitts. <br /><br />Beam Suntory could have a few treats for us this year. They have rebranded the Greenore as Kilbeggan Single Grain. They too have Sinsle Pot Still and could have some limited releases just to test the water. <br /><br />The Kilbeggan 21 went down well at WhiskyLive. They may decide to give the malts a spot in the sunlight this year. <br /><br />I'm really look forward to see what Bushmills will do now that they have been released from the shackles of Diageo. I'm may be too soon for them to do anything innovative but I've great expectations.<br /><br />I can only wait to see what Teelings have in store for us, one things for certain it won't be dull. They don't do that.</div>

I was told that the Irish Distillers year is the financial year, ending June. So we should be able to look forward to a couple of pot stills in the first half of 2015.<br /><br />I share your hopes and expectations regarding Kilbeggan, Bushmills and Teeling. Should be a great year!</div>

				<div class="content">I was in my local Tesco's in Athlone and browsed the whiskey shelves - as you do.<br /><br />A new offering caught my attention, O'Reilly's Premium Irish Whiskey, retailing for about 25 euro.<br /><br />Being of a certain age I didn't have my reading glasses with me so couldn't read the blurb on the back and thought I'd find some answers on the internet. I came up with a blank other than references to it on Tescos own site.<br /><br />Another own label expression for Tesco then?<br /><br />Didn't buy it as working my way through my Xmas and New Year whiskey booty!<br /><br />Anyone else come across it or tasted it yet?</div>

				<div class="content">Just arrived in last week on the Tesco shelves I think.<br />The address on the bottle is 162 Clontarf Rd., which<br />was the registered office of Cooley pre takeover so I <br />think it is a Cooley from the Teeling stable. Have not<br />tried it but probably fairly standard fare aimed at the<br />mid market where Teeling had a gap up till now.</div>

				<div class="content">I saw the O'Reilly whiskey on the shelf in Tesco over Christmas but when I went back a week later ,no stock and a blank look from the assistant ,when asked . Tesco's did have it on their website stating that it was a special price until Feb ,but it has now disappeared from the site.  As for 162 Clontarf Road, the home of the Teeling group of companies, I noticed that 2 new whiskey companies have been registered at that address in the last year, &quot;The Munster Distillery Co.Ltd &quot; on 14thJan 2014 and &quot;the Waterford Whiskey Co. Ltd&quot; on 22 Jan 2014 Directors James Finn and John Teeling .This is after the acquisition of the Great Northern Brewery and prior to Mark Reynier buying the Waterford brewery.</div>

				<div class="content">How will quantitative easing affect the Irish whiskey industry? <br /><br />That bottle of Midleton Peril now cost a few dollars less. I'm hopeful that the market will be flooded with new Whiskeys to meet the demand. <br /><br />My fear will be that the powers that be will increase the price in the domestic markets and I will be left looking at the Redbreasts on the shelf while I reach for something a little more affordable.</div>

				<div class="content">2015 has brought me a blast from the past. Michael Collins Irish Whiskey Blend in the old baseball bat type bottle. I thought these were a bit rare what with production stopped when Beam took over Cooley and the $100 million lawsuit. Obviously my local Centra in Athlone has some on sale and is unperturbed by such events.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Teelings</span> came out with great whiskeys this year. I've yet to try them all. I'm sure they'll have a few for next year too. <br />They have released Kavanagh's in the US and I've heard good things about it. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">IDL</span> come up with Dair Ghaelach and Powers three Swallow. These will be new expressions going forward. <br /><br />We also got a one of Redbreast, the Mano A Lámh. It sold for €65+ p&amp;p. I was very impressed with it particularly because it was released through their singlepotstill.com site for members. This has to be a first for them. <br /><br />One big change in policy from them is the new single cask Powers. We've got the Aviation &amp; Celtic Whiskey Shop releases so far. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Kilbeggan</span> are keeping things tight with no new releases but I'm sure there stock cooking. They had us busy with the Kilbeggan 21 &amp; Connemara 22 in 2014. <br /><br />We had <span style="font-weight: bold">Bushmills</span> at Whiskylive in Dublin this year. I was a the society stand just across from them. They had lots of visitors. Seamus Lowry, the brand ambassador and Colum Egan, master distiller were on the stand. I got some great sample to try and things look good for the future. Diageo is gone now &amp; will not be missed. Plans are in place to expand production. I'm looking forward to seeing what new expressions will follow. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Dingle</span> produces a whiskey as predicted. It was a limited edition Cask 2. I'm told it's nice but I've yet to try it. <br />They are producing Malt as well as Pot Still now. They're a great little distillery. I hope other that have started follow in their footsteps. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Altech</span> didn't come out with a new whiskey. They have stopped production in Carlow for the time being. I know they have be able to move to Dublin yet so things are a little stagnant for them. Fingers crossed that they'll get back in action soon. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">West Cork</span> Distillers have a brand out but it's not sold in Ireland. They have introduced The Pogues Irish Whiskey which is available in Supervalu for €30. Frank McHardy is behind the production so it should e an improvement on previous efforts.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The Irish Whiskey Society </span> came out with our first ever Grain. This was sourced from Midleton and was also their first ever release of a grain.</div>
