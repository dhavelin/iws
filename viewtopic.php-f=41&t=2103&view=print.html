				<div class="content">I've been saving this very old bottle of JJ&amp;S Whiskey for a special occasion but I was told not to open it before I did some research on it because it could possibly be rare, I know it's old but that's about all I know now. Any input would be gratefully appreciated.<div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">I just received a message from JJ&amp;S that is calling my bottle one of our historical bottles, we are currently checking our archives to identify the bottle you've described.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> is it strange for me to comment on my own post?

				<div class="content">That's a beautiful bottle indeed. They are rare to find. Certainly one for a special occasion. <br /><br />I think it's from the 50's possibly early 60's. I've had one I got a few years ago on whiskyauctions.com. I believe I paid a pretty sum for it then. It was from the Italian market. Yours appear to be an original Irish one. Has it a duty free stamp on the rear? I seen one a few years ago that came from Shannon duty free.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes it does have a duty free stamp on the rear that says TAX-FREE EX SHANNON AIRPORT ONLY and a spot that says SEREAL NO.______________ but there is no number there from what I can see.</div>

				<div class="content">The one I seen was the same I think. <br /><br />I have a feeling they may have been for Duty Free or the foreign market. I don't see them selling on the Irish market back then. <br /><br />If your interested in selling you could try The Celtic Whiskey Shop or someone here may be interested. I'd look at whiskyauction.com 's result archive to get a guide price. They have one for â‚¬500. It says it from the 40/50 but I didn't think they were selling the 12 year old back then., but I'm not certain. I know retailers would be selling for premium prices, so their prices are generally much higher than you'd expect to get. <br /><br />If you get info from the Midleton archive regarding the age I love to know it.</div>

				<div class="content">Checked out The Celtic Whiskey Shop but I'm not sure how to access the archives. I will let you know though what I find out. I did post a question about this old hexagon shaped bottle on the Jameson Facebook page and have had several reply's from them. The last one has heightened my curiosity greatly, I'm getting excited having finally gotten some results, and positive ones to boot.</div>

				<div class="content">I found my bottle on the Irish whiskey Chaser page in the Jameson section under HISTORIC BOTTLES pre 70's. I scrolled down and found mine which appears to be from the 60's. This is the most info I have been able to find so far, still looking forward to hearing more from the Jameson company itself.</div>
