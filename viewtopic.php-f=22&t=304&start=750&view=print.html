But there have been sherry monsters i liked, make that 'that i loved', a'Bunadh #20 for example. This Mortlach 16yo is a bit too sharp on the nose, and on the palate the middle is missing, all of it. I'm genuinely disappointed as there is some thing quite lovely that is unable to reveal itself. No major sulphur signature going on, but i wonder. Could this be an e150 overload, Diageo (damn them).

I did come across one batch which was sour and not in a nice way but a once off. <br /><br />In regards to the Mortlach<br /><br />The Big Sherry is there (Raisin &amp; dried currants) but not totally dominant with layers of other flavours like ripe whiskey soaked orange, sweet dark chocolate and a love dry spice bite. I think there is plenty of other stuff mingling around in there too so it really is a glass full of flavour. <br /><br />This was recommended to me by a couple of Scotch Malt enthusiasts that I trust and I was delighted that they had so I find your comments surprising. I wounder is this an off bottle ... when is it from ??? ... I've checked out my Mortlach F&amp;F and it is from 2008 ... must say I still think it is a very good drop.</div>

				<div class="content">There's an off licence on the left just after the bridge in New Ross which occasionally has interesting things - it's a fairly old and haphazard place but I picked up to Redbreasts from the 1980's there a couple of years ago for â‚¬75 each when they were going for around â‚¬250 elsewhere. I saw a Jameson 15 PPS in the window one day but didn't have time to stop. Can't remember the name but it's the one possible off licence I can think of in county wexford that might have what you want.</div>
