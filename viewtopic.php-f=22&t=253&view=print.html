				<div class="content">What's the difference?<br /><br />Is there one?<br /><br />This came up in another topic earlier so I thought I put it out there. I've no well formed view yet.<br /><br />I'm not saying we should quantify it or anything but in my mind there's a difference between a bar that happens to have a few decent whiskeys,, which are often obvious choices - e.g. plinths etc., and one which make a genuine effort to have a decent selection with a few more unusual bottles. They don't have to be of the standard of Tigh Niechtain in Galway or anything, just a few of interest.<br /><br />Any thoughts?</div>

				<div class="content">One approach could be to adopt the format of the LA Whiskey Society or something similar.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lawhiskeysociety.com/bars_list_group.php?grouped=1&amp;filter=&amp;order=&amp;asc=">http://www.lawhiskeysociety.com/bars_li ... rder=&amp;asc=</a><!-- m --><br /><br />They list the bars, no. of whiskies (I can see it now, IanB in the bar counting whiskies and getting strange looks)prices for benchmark whiskeys (say Black Bush, JJS12,Connemara, Midleton,etc) expense rating and a recommended by using their symbol.<br /><br />Alternatively list no of Irish, Scotch &amp; World whiskies<br /><br />Could be incorporated permanently on the website part.<br /><br />Just throwing it out there for discussion.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think there is a difference but I do agree with you that they should be seen to make an effort on the whiskey front to get a mention. <br /><br />But what the criteria is and how we should judge it is another thing.</div>
