				<div class="content">I was drinking some Buffalo Trace and added some Sherry to see how it reacted. I was surprised at how little affected the taste. I wonder how a bourbon would taste if it were finished in a Sherry or Port Cask?  <br /><br />I searched the web and seen a couple of examples like Belle Meade. Are there many doing this? Are the readily available?</div>

				<div class="content">Obviously I think as you have said they will have experimented with this but that fact we never see much of these types is possible a factor that it is thought not to be worth while. <br /><br />There are 2 factors I think may not go in it's favour. <br /><br />Basically the legal Cask usage constraints that the American whiskey industry has had to endure ... <br /><br /><br />i.e.<br /><br />1. American Whiskey as far as I'm aware can only be aged in new, charred American Oak or as they say these days Virgin American Oak.<br /><br />and<br /><br />2. as Bourbon and alot of other American types of whiskey are already quite sweet due to the above method maybe putting a sherry layer on top of that may possibly be just a touch too much.<br /><br />But number 2 is just a hunch by me.</div>

				<div class="content">Angels Evny is aged in Port Casks.<br /><br />Heaven Hill released a 10 yr Parkers Heritage collection in 2011 that was finished in Cognac<br /><br />And Jim Beam has a Master Distillers edition of 18 and 20 yrs old that were finished in Cognac and Port casks respectively.<br /><br />and there are several micros that are releasing &quot;wine finished&quot; Bourbon to try to compete with the big boys.<br /><br />I, personally, am not a fan of wine finished bourbon.</div>
