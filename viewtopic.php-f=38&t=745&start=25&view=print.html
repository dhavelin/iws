				<div class="content">I must admit I feel sorry for Kaka as it really was a bad way to go out and you could just as easily say cheating on the part of the Ivory Coast player. I think it is ludicrous that these red cards cannot be recinded. How can a ref that did not see the incident send someone off ? <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />Brazil had some silky play but I'm not 100% sure about them as a team as to how they will cope against the stronger teams.<br /><br />First goal by Fabiano was a cracker ... however I was not overly impressed by Lucio who was falling all over the place in sheer agony if anybody touched him  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> .</div>

				<div class="content">I feel sad for the French people who have been terribly let down by the collection of chancers and cheats sent to represent their nation in South Africa.<br />It's ignominious for fans to spend their hard-earned money travelling so far to support such a bunch of lazy, self-entitled, self-important reprobates.<br />Sarkozy apparently intends to hold a public inquiry into this global PR disaster for France. I'm not sure that's the best way forward, but I'll leave it to the French to deal with French matters.<br />As an Irishman, I am merely gratified that this team and their management's collective appalling behaviour from November to the present has resulted in no reward and the righteous contempt of the sporting world.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: this post has been edited by the moderators and offensive remarks have been removed. It has to be highlighted that any offensive remarks will not be tolerated on this forum even if made in jest.</div>

				<div class="content">I was rooting for Holland but after seeing how they played in the first half I was not overly concerned by the second half. Spain played the better football and deserved their victory. Holland should have only finished with maximum 9 players if not 8 and really let themselves down. Has been a bit of a dissappointing world cup over all eventhough the latter stages did throw up a few decent games.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with the mod actions above. Establishing the facts of alleged crimes is way beyond the competence (or interest, really) of the moderators on this forum. It should be possible to stick to whiskey and light conversation around here. Quite a few posters are readily identifiable (myself included), unlike on many internet forums, and I'd like to preserve the generally pleasant environment that facilitates this.</div>
