				<div class="content">I think it's a funny one, because it's from two distilleries. Not sure they can call it single malt, but it's all malt, for sure. <br /><br />Do they have a term for this kind of thing? A double malt?</div>

				<div class="content">Technically not a single malt according to the definitions that apply in Scotland.<br />I'd be inclined to call it a pure malt, myself.<br />But since there are no rules here in Ireland, no doubt they'll call it a single malt.<br />Which brings me back to the thread: What is Irish whiskey?<br />It's high time there were some guidelines and rules about what terms can be applied. We've seen Cooley play fast and loose with the term 'pure potstill' in the past. No harm to them, but I think they're devaluing the meaning of these terms the way they use them sometimes.<br />We probably need to create a consensus on what's what and have it underwritten by legislation.</div>

				<div class="content">I think this can be argued as a single malt on a slant of a technicallity.<br /><br />Do we all agree that you have to distill a whiskey.<br /><br />Well the wort is only a brew of Beer so the the distilation aspect has not happened yet.<br /><br />All distilation happens in Kilbeggan so the spirit/whiskey is soley produced in a single distillery.</div>
