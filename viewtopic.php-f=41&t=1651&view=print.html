				<div class="content">A friend of mine send me a message about Jameson Red Seal Whiskey.<br />He has a bottle with it printed on the label.<br />I've looked around and could find no information what so ever. I've a few old bottles of Jameson but none say RED SEAL WHISKEY on the label. He sent a phone picture that verifies the name and I'll post a proper photo when he send me a good copy.<br /><br />Bit of a head scratcher for me? He also has a few other odd ones he says. I'll keep posted.</div>

				<div class="content">Saw this on eBay a while back.  It's a mini, though.  Is your friend's full sized?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Jameson-Red-Seal-Irish-Whiskey-Miniature-/170828575387?pt=UK_Collectables_Bottle_Pots_ET&amp;hash=item27c62d329b" class="postlink">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Jameson-Red-Seal-Irish-Whiskey-Miniature-/170828575387?pt=UK_Collectables_Bottle_Pots_ET&amp;hash=item27c62d329b</a><br /><br />Does look like marketing for the standard Jameson.  Don't know when/where it would have been sold, however.</div>

				<div class="content">It's a full size bottle. I have a photo of the label. he send another but was not suitable. It appears to be the exact same as the 70/80's bottles. the label is the only thing different.<br /><br />I'm glad that miniature bottle was posted. It reminds me of another thing I posted a while back when I found a miniature bottle of Jameson 10 instead of Crested 10. Are there bottles of Jameson 10 out there?</div>

				<div class="content">When first launched as a brand it was branded Jameson Dublin Whiskey not Jameson Irish Whiskey.<br />The use of the 'Jameson Red Seal' may have come in the interim period between the two or<br />of course as said it may have been a regional variation. I'm not sure if many have survived of the<br />'Dublin Whiskey' as the bottle looked essentiall the same and because of this may not have survived<br />a determined attack on the Drinks cabinet at the end of a party  <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Raven,<br />I'll tell him to hold on to it if so. May be worth a few bob in a few years.<br /><br />He was reading the tread and sent me a message that he has also got an old bottle of Crested 10 with a cork cap.<br />I'll post a photo as soon as I get one sent to me.( JCB phones don't received picture messages ) <br />When I was reading the text I thought he was going to say he had a bottle of Jameson 10 too. <br /><br />What is the history on Crested 10? <br />My old bottle is a screw cap and is from Bow Street Distillery. I picked it up at Tennant's auctions a few month back.<br />I'll attach a photo.<br /><br />He says his has the same label but with a Cork and a intact seal with JJ&amp;S around it and a ship embossed on it. I'll have to take a trip to Kerry to see if he has any other hidden treasures!</div>

				<div class="content">As a brand Crested 10 dates from 1963. Jameson realized they could make a lot<br />more revenue by bottling themselves. Originally contents were 10 yr. old and upwards<br />but now anything from 8 to 15 yrs. old according to Jim Murray's Whiskey Almanac<br />(1994) -- When were screw caps introduced ??<br /><br />I'm also not sure whether one can differentiate between a Bow St. bottling and a later Midleton <br />bottling ??? I would not trust the fact that Bow St., appears on the label -- artistic licence and all that  <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <br />In the case of your bottle an answer lies as to when the 750 ml. print was introduced <br />side by side with the pre-decimal measurement.</div>

				<div class="content">I've asked him about the size and volume of his and he can't find any numbers on it that relate to either. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br />It's appears to be the same size as the Red Label Whiskey that I posted earlier.<br /><br />I've seen this on old bottles of John Power &amp; Son I have at home here both have corks too if it's of any importance.</div>
