				<div class="content">They were definitely three casks bottled at 43% Cask #86583, 86584 &amp; 86585. A total of 1,000 bottles were produced which would indicate about 333 per cask.<br /><br />This would tally with the 30yo single cask #1831/56 bottled at 40% yielded a total of 300 bottles.<br /><br />They only unsolved part of the mystery is the 26yo from the same series of which cask #39810 is the only one I am aware of, yet there were 1,000 bottles of this release also so they may be two other casks awaiting discovery.</div>

				<div class="content">On the Midleton 26 Year Old,<br /><br />IDL had six casks from 1973, three were bottled as individual casks for the Midleton 25 Year Old release and the other three were re-casked in a single port pipe for up to a year for the Midleton 26 Year Old and released the following year.</div>
