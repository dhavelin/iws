				<div class="content">Hi Maca, <br /><br />Sorry to be bearer of bad news but ...<br /><br />Master of Malt have it for £122.95 which is just over €155. So for you on the secondary market you'd probably need to drop it about 20-40% to entice a buyer.</div>

				<div class="content">YA I have just been looking else where for valuations. <br /><br />That seems to be a more reasonable price. <br /><br />The whisky exchange seem to be very high priced.<br /><br />So hopefully I will now get it sold</div>

				<div class="content">The Master of Malt price is a legacy price. If they were selling it now, they'd definitely be asking for more than that. The Whisky Exchange is one of the only shops selling it right now. This ceramic version, that is. But if it was worth what they're selling it for, they'd have none left. <br /><br />But as you say, you won't get retail prices for it. There's one on eBay advertised for £150 at the moment. You could see if that sells or what it sells for to give you an indication of value. I doubt it would sell for that, to be honest. I'd say you might get about £100 for it. Selling ceramics can be hard, because it's hard to know how much spirit is left in the container.</div>

				<div class="content">Looks like there may not be too much interest in the fiddic however you could try somewhere like whiskywhiskywhisky a mainly scotch forum. Not sure about their rules though as some members get uppity on people selling but just ignore that.</div>
