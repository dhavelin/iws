				<div class="content">Those Old Middleton look fine indeed. For me it's a Tullibardine 1988 46%. There nothing wrong with this whisky at all, no faults to report, it is however a bit dull, lacking complexity. Saved by a big earthy barley.</div>

I'm not keen on a lot of Diageo standards as they're too heavy on the E150 - i'm quite sensitive to it it seems. The Talisker 10 is one of the worst. The Talisker 57 North is 57% and has much less of the E150 effect - it's a good Talisker.</div>

				<div class="content">Started with a Marfield only 20% and quite dissappointing on taste but a very interesting and intense nose. <br /><br />Next a Benraich 23yo cask strength ... really only had a tiny sip of this and really promising. The flavours came across rich.<br /><br />However I was in a rush to taste the Ardbeg Corryvreckan as this is the distillery I love to hate.<br /><br />Well what can I say what a monster of a whiskey and I totally love it. I can get some of the ardbeg taste that dissagrees with me but in this case it is not an off note as it is balanced by what I am guessing is a sherry matured part of the  whisky. A powerful but rewarding whisky.</div>
