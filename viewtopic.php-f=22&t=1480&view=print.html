				<div class="content">Well I can't leave them out. <br /><br />Personally I'd like ot see a certain cask bottled at the perfect age and win the Whiskybible world whiskey of the year for that year. But only after we made JM pay several hundred euro for a 200ml sample.<br /><br />This may never happen. <br /><br />Otherwise I look forward to some more SPS!</div>

				<div class="content">i also look forward to trying a certain cask when its ready, trying a fuller range of killbeggan-made whisky in general, perhaps a malt that hasnt been watered down and botched with caramel, and perhaps a lightly peated single pot still. yes, you heard me right. that's secretly what i've been hoping cooley play around with ever since they got on board with SPS in general.</div>

				<div class="content">in fact, on the subject of killbeggan, i'd be happy to see anything at all available from the distillery. i noticed that the distillery is no longer listed on the CWS website, whichused to give it a special tab along with the other three irish distilleries, so i'm assuming they've run out of stock of the original kilbeggan malt. Does anyone know what the story is with Kilbeggan's immediate plans?</div>
