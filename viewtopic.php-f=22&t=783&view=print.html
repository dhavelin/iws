				<div class="content">I've been curious to try this one because of the implication on the label that it only uses first-fill bourbon barrels. It implies an interest in quality, anyway.</div>

				<div class="content">As you say David sounds like a fairly decent quality blend but we all know how PR people bend the facts.<br /><br />Small Batch I feel is a bit misleading though. I'm sure that this maybe produced in small Batches i.e. grab x amount of matured whiskey and make it up in a batch and bottle it but small batch really refers to a single batch of whiskey distilled at the one time and casked and kept in context. This is a common term in American whiskey where they do produce whiskey in batches but I think Cooley produce on a much larger scale. Whether there is a major difference or not is another story.<br /><br />However in saying that the use of first fill bourbon would be of more importance on the whiskey than making it in small batches. So if this is also correct for the maturation of the grain whiskey used it would indeed  lead us to believe that this should be a quality blend as we all know how good Cooley grain can be.<br /><br />Unfortunately I think we on this side of the pond may never see this  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">Has anyone seen this on any shelves in the Eastern US? I like to buy at bigger stores, as the selection is far greater, but so many brands I see mentioned here aren't in any of the stores I visit.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't recall seeing it either. I always look through the Irish and Scotch to see if anything new. <br /><br />I always got a kick out of Scotch calling itself &quot;rare&quot;, with so many bottles of it on the shelves.</div>
