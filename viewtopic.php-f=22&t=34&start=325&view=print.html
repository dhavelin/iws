				<div class="content">I popped into Lidl to grab a few bottles of their new beers under the Name &quot;Crafty Brewing Company&quot;. I got the red Ale and the Larger which I'm guessing (and hoping) is more along Boston Larger lines than Budweiser by the description. However while on my way to the till I had a quick look at the spirits section. Firstly I noticed that they now have an aged version of their Queen Margot which is a 5yo. Would still not hold out much for it though. But then I noticed another addition Abrachan triple cask at €24.99. No age statement but is nicely boxeed and quite dark in appearence. It seemingly has been finished in both oloroso casks and port pipes. Sounds lovely but I have no clue? Anybody have had a try yet? If I don't hear anything negative in the next week or so I may give it a try.<br /><br />Also I purchased the the Aldi 8yo Black label or what ever it is called a while back and I must admit it is not a bad whisky at all. Very much in the lightly sherried speyside style so if you like that sort of style very well worth your while giving it a go, smooth and easy to drink (too easy  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />   ). Definately worth just having to offer guests if tnothing else and not feeling your giving them some muck.</div>

But it was a bit of a hike for me as I'm not in the City.<br /><br />Basically I drove the 15-20mins into Oranmore to the Tesco there to try and buy, but it was not on offer in Oranmore  <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <br /><br />I then decided to head to the Galway Shopping centre (another 15min drive) and I had a glance at the shelf and low &amp; behold it was out of stock. I was disappointed but had a nose around and saw one had fallen over on it's side and to the back of the shelf. So result for me but whether they have any left in stock I cannot say. I hope I did not rob you of the chance as I checked on-line and the Talisker is not listed as on offer  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />So not sure what them situation is? It is either a past offer which they have forgotten to remove in that shop or it will up coming very soon and they have jumped the gun.</div>
