				<div class="content">Hi, I'm new to this forum and I joined for two reasons; first, I like Irish whiskey about as well as any whiskey I've tried, and second, I'm about to spend 3 weeks in Ireland which will give me an opportunity to try a lot more varieties than I can find in the Virginia ABC stores. The ABC stores have: Bushmills, Jamesons, Tulemore, Killbeggen, and Irish Manor. I drink a lot of cheap bourbon, Stoli, Gin, not much scotch. Mostly I'm so old that my olfactory senses are pretty well shot and I'm happy with whatever has alcohol in it, but Irish whiskey is my favorite, even though I know nothing about it.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello <br /><br />I'm sligeach and I've joined as I'm interested in gaining more knowledge in Irish spirits beyond my cousin's (RIP - but not from the) poteen. <br />I enjoy 15-yr.

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br />I'm Aidan. I'm of Irish descent but have been living and working by the Arctic Circle in Norway since 1991. <br />I spent my formative years at boarding school in Antrim (Garron Tower) where I was afforded the opportunity to visit to the Bushmill's distillery. This was way back in 84 or 85 and their whiskeys have been my favourites ever since. As is the case with most ex-pats I tend to extoll the virtues of Irish whiskey over their Scottish counterparts. With the number of successful converts I've made over here I should perhaps have been a priest...<br />I've joined the forum with a very specific purpose/request in mind which I'll post outside the introduction area.<br />Really looking forward to some constructive feedback from informed forum members in due course.</div>
