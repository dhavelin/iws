				<div class="content">I have tried asking on the websites that are specifically for distilling with some  but little results.<br /><br />Sooo Does anyone have experience with PID temperature controlls.<br /><br />I want to use one in part of  my still operation.  I want to use it as a means of deactivating a contacter that will switch my applied voltage to the heat element from 240 to 120 volts.<br /><br /> I can already do it with a device i have  by simply throwing a toggle switch but I really would like it to happen when temperature rise at the  base of the tower first is sensed. I'm using a K sensor in the relay  mode.<br /> <br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/special%20%20hobby%20tools/voltagebox.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />The PID is an Auber SYL-1512A<br /><br /> It is on thes yahoo search list in pdf form<br /><br /><a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search%3B_ylt=AifHkeA6TfyRwOFPSl2kxjh52PAI?p=The+PID+is+an+Auber+SYL-1512A&amp;fr=my-myy&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" class="postlink">http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=AifHkeA6TfyRwOFPSl2kxjh52PAI?p=The+PID+is+an+Auber+SYL-1512A&amp;fr=my-myy&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8</a><br /><br /><br />JUST ANOTHER NOTE<br /> I have it working  but it doesnt shut the heater off when the temperature is reached. Im using a  mock up that has a beaker with water, a small heat element and a k type sensor.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/VODKA/DSCF0003.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

A guy in sweeden helped me.<br />   Right  now it automatically changes the voltage applied to the internal heat element from   240 volts to 120 volts((( de activates a  mechanical relay)) I have tested it and it works ok. I had to chase down the correct DIN sizes of drill bit and tap to correctly install the jerry rigged setup i have  now,<br />     As asoon as i am released from rehab, (( hip replacement)) i will do that little chore and work on a system to separete the diferent factions that come out of a still.<br /><br />I thought that i would  mention that the system i intend to make will not be  good for whiskey but only for vodka.</div>
