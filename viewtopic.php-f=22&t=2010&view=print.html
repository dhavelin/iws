				<div class="content">A conference on Irish Whiskey will be held in the historic Port of <span style="font-weight: bold">Youghal </span>on the 29th./30th. September next (  10 lectures <br />programme). The names of a lot of the speakers are well recognizable. This is the 11th. annual conference of 'Youghal Celebrates History' <br />a  voluntary group of which I am part. Youghal was one of the earliest areas where whiskey was produced in the early 1600’s <br />as mentioned in a diary entry of Richard Boyle whose myriad of industries in the area were the subject of a previous conference. (His direct <br />ancestor the Duke of Devonshire still retains Lismore Castle and the Lismore Estate a few miles upriver as well as amongst other things the <br />bed of the River Blackwater down to the sea at Youghal.)<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1617 : Richard Boyle the 1st. Earl of Cork ( and friend of Sir Walter Raleigh ) notes in his diary for 20th March, 1617 what is in all probability<br />the first recorded export of whiskey to America ( not just any whiskey but ‘Choice Aquavite’).  The entry occurs in a sequence of entries which <br />show that he was in Youghal at the time.<br /> <br />&quot;Sent by fforest servant to Mr. Nicholas galwaye, 32 gallons of choice Aquavite, to my cozen Barsie of Plymouth, to be presented to Sir Walter <br />Raleigh for his Guiana voyadge.&quot;<br /> <br />(The entry occurs in a sequence of entries which show that he was in Youghal at the time which also means that the whiskey was from <br />Youghal where the vast bulk of his various business interests were concentrated. Boyle was noted to always record gifts particularly to <br />Sir Walter Raleigh from whom he had bought his Youghal Estates.)<br /> </span><br />Our website is<span style="font-weight: bold"> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youghalcelebrateshistory.com">http://www.youghalcelebrateshistory.com</a><!-- m --> </span>and a PDF of our brochure is downloadable. One can also view details of our <br />previous conferences and speakers. Paypal is the payment method which everyone is well familiar with.In any event for Irish Whiskey <br />buffs who also appreciate the history aspects keep the dates free. Some members of IWS already probably got hard copies of the brochure <br />from the night of the June tasting, so this post is just a reminder for those who may like to attend.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks,David I We have uploaded some whiskey images onto our Facebook<br />page and will be adding more as our conference dates approach. Already I note<br />some IWS members have booked places. East Cork will have a busy September<br />in a lot of whiskey aspects. The fields around here have been shorn of their golden crop<br />which will be appreciated in another form by whiskey imbibers in future years  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
