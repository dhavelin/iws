I found it a reasonable substitute for white wine with dinner if you didn't want to drink much. I used to pour it in a wine glass and just have one or two. At most half a can which meant I didn't get lazy / sleepy as I sometimes do after a few glasses of wine.<br /><br />Don't like the regular Bulmers at all. Don't tell my sister - she works there! Her partner too but I think he'll be moving to Grants along with Tullamore dew. Not that they mentioned him in the press release or anything.</div>

				<div class="content">Just had some Busmills select cask 12yo (the one with rum cask in it). I'm now onto a Bushmills 12yo Distillers Selection. It says &quot;distillers selection&quot; as opposed to &quot;distillery reserve&quot; but the labels are similar. Quite nice and similar to how I remember the reserve but I've no idea of where it came from. I mean I know where I bought it but where and when it was originally sold I don't know. I'd guess it's the same vintage as some of those Jameson12 distillers selections knocking around from a couple of years ago.</div>
