				<div class="content">hey guys, it's been a while since i've dropped by the forum (school and other petty distractions) but i was wondering what the verdict was on this stuff at your tasting? I have a close friend whose getting married in the fall and he's a pretty avid fan of PPS. I was thinking of getting him either the new PPS CWS bottling or the terminal 2 bottling. Any suggestions?</div>

Of course he can always water it down if not  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />For me it probably would have to be the T2 bottling as it is cask strength (53.7%) which makes it quite unique for an IDL bottling. But in all fairness both will be super bottlings so it really is a toss up and which is the easiest to source.</div>

				<div class="content">oh thank you zoltan/luke, that's tremendously helpful <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Unfortunately i'm on a student budget so its a big spring just to get one or the other. As for the recipient, he's most certainly used to cask strength whiskeys and, among the more regular PPS botlings, he has a thing for green spot if that helps narrow it down between the two</div>

				<div class="content">as for sourcing, CWS of course ship abroad and i'll be in Dublin sometime around July/August so i should be able to pop into terminal 2 (any views on the likelihood that there'll still be bottles there?)</div>
