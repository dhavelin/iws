				<div class="content">Adrian,<br /><br />unfortunately I didn't transfer my posts from our last website to this one. I am enjoying this whiskey (although my expectations were different at the start) but I keep coming back to it to try and understand and experience the huge undivided (it seems) adoration for this pot still whiskey.<br /><br />I still think I am missing something big here. Yes it is mouthwatering, oily and whewy to me also. I get the toffee and the spice. However, I am at a loss to see how quite alot of people vote this as one of the worlds best whiskeys.<br /><br />Feeling like an outcast! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />...and that's the beauty of this complex tipple  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Stephen</div>

I'm head over heals with Laphroaig but just don't get Ardbeg ... some people think I'm a mad man  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Unfortunately an Irish Whiskey like Redbreast 15 yo comes up so seldom at the original price that we all jumped at it and in that possibly talked it up too often but for me still a Giant of an Irish Whiskey.  If Jameson Rarest Vintage was available at 56Euro a bottle I think I'd be saying the very same about that but it just may fall short of that cult status because of the 400Euro price tag.</div>

				<div class="content">I have the same problem re Ardbeg/Laphroaig - Can't understand the attraction of Ardbeg/Love Laphroaig.<br /><br />Redbreast 15 is Ard-RÃ­ of Pure Pot Still (at least until a proper NCF 18YO emerges - at 48-50%!)</div>

				<div class="content">Redbreast 15yo<br /><br />Nose: Has that typical Irish smell to me. Sherry in a not to small dose. Some maltiness and rather &quot;fullflavored&quot; what ever I mean with that.<br /><br />Taste: Fruity, smooth, oily (I like that oily feeling). Some spiciness but that's not what I sense first.<br /><br />Finish: A bit flat and not the best part of this. Not to much differences to the taste, just falls down a bit. <br /><br />Comment: Good vork Midleton and IDL. At Whiskycast the keep gnabbing about Redbreast as THE single pot still. I will put some of this up against some other a see. I will not be surprised if Redbreast will stand the test. Easy going but rather full-bodied, a lot of complexity and sweetness that makes it a very good dram.</div>
