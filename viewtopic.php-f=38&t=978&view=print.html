				<div class="content">A few shots of the winter wonderland around Retford Notts today. All on a compact camera so apologies for the quality. The snow is 20&quot; deep, and deeper in parts.<br /> <br />One from the Mrs, hence the flash on the window - bless her. The back yard.<br /> <br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5003/5224610499_0287c39dde_z.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /> <br />A busy street<br /> <br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5249/5225206350_6957a2e2be_z.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /> <br />On the 'high street'.<br /> <br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5121/5225209390_462bb6224a_z.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /> <br />Just after i cleared a route to the back gate another 'blizzard' starts.<br /> <br /><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5224612881_037c88cbc4_z.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /> <br />A barge sat on the Cheserfield Canal during a late stroll earlier.<br /> <br /><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5284/5224613839_249de62804_z.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

It was covered up again in no time. I reckon it's safer to walk on the snow anyway than the black ice underneath.<br /><br />Nice pics!</div>

I saw on the news scotland was expecting temps as low as -25 and possibly lower with -27 being the lowest recorded so they are not far off a record up there.</div>

Met Office were talking about it over the cold snap. Essentially the reason you didn't get any was that the bands of precipitation (i.e. clouds) missed you. With the lack of cloud cover the temperature may have fallen further than would otherwise have been the case but that still means the lack of snow and the cold have the same root cause rather than one causing the other. <br /><br />Or something.<br /><br />I drove past gorey one day and it was minus 10. And there was plenty of snow.</div>

				<div class="content">You folks got hit earlier than we did in the eastern USA. Our big storm, 30 inches or more, came Dec 26. I blame all those who wished for a white Christmas. Got another 4 inches Jan 2, and 6 more on Jan 11-12. More than we usually get, and a lot earlier too.<br /><br />Are big snowfalls normal for your side of the Atlantic? East coast storms here move eastward across the country, and we can watch them approach and figure out when and how much snowfall we could get.</div>

				<div class="content">In Ireland we very rarely see snow so even an inch is a big deal never mind 3 &amp; 4 inches. Also sub zero temperatures are not very common and -1 to -3 would be a hard winter so -12 to -17 is  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />Because of the infrequency of such temps we are not equiped to deal with them ... i.e. very few people would have snow chains for their cars.<br /><br />Grid lock on roads, water pipes freezing it was an experience that a lot of people had not had before.</div>
