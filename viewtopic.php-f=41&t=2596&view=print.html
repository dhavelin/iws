				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering what you guys thing of the Centenary Collection 1914 Single Cask Irish Whiskey available at Dublin Airport. Is it worth the money? Is it collectible? Or is it just priced because it's limited? <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.theloop.ie/p/13456/centenary-collection-1914-single-cask-irish-whiskey-70cl">http://www.theloop.ie/p/13456/centenary ... iskey-70cl</a><!-- m -->  <br /><br /><br /><br />Any advise is welcome.</div>

				<div class="content">it's priced as a collectable whiskey. I don't really think it worth drinking at that price, you'll find much better whiskey for a fraction of the price. <br /><br />I'm not really sure who would collect it too. I don't see what's really remarkable about it. I can understand single cask Midleton's or Teelings 20+s commanding the price but this doesn't tick the same boxes for me. That's me of course, others will have different opinions I'm sure.</div>

				<div class="content">I am wondering cause it's available for almost 2 years and still available. That made me curious what others think of it. Usualy these very limeted bottles will go fast and the price dropped from 395 Eur to 295 Eur.Thanks for your opinion. Anything you would recommend at the moment?<blockquote><div><cite>Good Whiskey Hunting wrote:</cite>it's priced as a collectable whiskey.

				<div class="content">We tried this at the Dingle tasting last April. It wasn't mind blowing. The Mano A Lámh was on the line up and was very popular. <br /><br />We're going to be awash with collectable whiskeys in years to come and I don't see this gaining much in time. It reminds me of one of those endless commemorative Jack Daniels bottles.</div>

				<div class="content">I think I leave that one where it is and hope that they have the Midleton Very Rare 2014 still available. With that being the first one from Brian Nation it might be worth keeping it and if it's not collectible it's definitely enjoyable.<blockquote><div><cite>IrishWhiskeyChaser wrote:</cite>I've heard very little about it ... €295 is quite a steep price but I suppose it is a 24yo and a single cask so at least your getting something for your money but there has been very little promotion about it and even less people mentioning that they have tasted it.  <br /><br />I don't even know the company behind it.

				<div class="content">I don't now where it's from either, but given the age and that it was supplied by Teeling, it is likely not a Cooley. I could be wrong. <br /><br />Do Teeling have stocks of aged Cooley?</div>

				<div class="content">Not sure if this is any good ZeClaw but you should still be able to get it in Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport. I believe there is a reasonable price too, lower than the introductory price I believe as it is a one-price-for-all in terms of duty paid / duty free destinations.</div>
