				<div class="content">Yes I would be very interested what they make of any of the SPS because the Malt Maniacs are very much Malt biased (imho of course <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> )</div>

Virtually every whisky, if not all, got a medal which I find hard to relate to and at the end of the day they will only judge what has been submitted, which is a form of sponsorship. In essence it is a very limited snap shot of whisky yet a lot of credence is put on their Awards amongst the serious whisky drinking public as they are seen as independent. Unfortunately I don't see that. I'm certainly not questioning their integrity but I'm just a bit skeptical of the Awards and their relevance.<br /><br />But then I'm a Skeptic in general anyway  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>
