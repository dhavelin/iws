				<div class="content">I've just seen there's a new Distilleries in Waterford. The Blackwater Distillery. It's a micro distillery and the first new one there for 174 years. <br />They hope to start distilling before the end of the year. <br /><br />I wish them the best of luck and hope to talk with someone there soon to see what style of whiskey they are doing. I'm assuming they will be doing whiskey anyway although it could be Vodka and Gin.</div>

				<div class="content">Greetings from Cappoquin in West Waterford - let me start by saying that websites aren't what they used to be. Holding pages are no longer good enough and responsive, mobile enabled, e-commerce bells and whistles take time - so sorry for the delay on that front. In the meantime we are on Twitter @BlackDistillery and when there's more to say, trading on Facebook as Blackwaterdistillery.</div>

				<div class="content">We will start production this year and we will start conservatively, I can't be more specific right now as one of the problems with setting up a business in rural Ireland is the shocking lack of basic infrastructure - from internet to waste water, everything is a battle and that is all impacting on R&amp;D. But there's no point setting up a micro-distillery to replicate the offerings of the multi-nationals that control 99% of the spirit production in this country. The Scots are lashed to conformity by their sporran straps, while here in Ireland we have wonderfully open legislation and we're not exploiting it.</div>
