				<div class="content">Excellent price and probably a fair price ... you'll find it hard to get it for much less anywhere else. Possibly you may get it for that on ebay as irish whiskey is i=not reselling well currently but specialist retailers will look for a hell of a lot more for it.  <br /><br />Did you by in privately or from a local off icence</div>

				<div class="content">Inspired by Michael and Luke's superlative smokey whisk(e)y tasting, I picked up a Laphroaig triple wood (one litre!) and a Caol Isla Zinfandel finish this week.<br /><br />I also grabbed a Celtic Nations to replace the one the society drank way back in the days of our earliest tastings in Bowes. You don't see many of those around any more (not since the Scotch Whisky Association decided it was naughty to vat Irish malt and Scotch). <br /><br />And a 1993 Daluaine to add to the nipper's birthyear whiskey collection.<br /><br />So far, I've opened the Laphroaig (which is great stuff, and my palate for smokey whiskies is notably more tolerant thanks to the education I got the other night) and the Caol Isla, which is downright superb. The only problem may be ensuring there's some left in the bottles for when the other half gets back to the house, since she's already miffed at having to miss the tasting on Thursday!</div>

				<div class="content">Afaik, they objected to it on the grounds that it wasn't Scotch, basically, because it had some Irish in it.<br />Then there appears to have been stern words issued to Bruichladdich by the SWA, and they were persuaded to abandon their plans to issue 9 such bottlings.<br />Hence there is and only ever will be one. <br />We opened my last one back in the early days of the society, and if I recall, it was ok, nothing spectacular, quite light and inoffensive really. But I decided to replace it because you don't see them around much, and it was only 45 euro in a German supermarket!</div>

				<div class="content">The thing is it never said it was Scotch. And a few years before there was the Jon Mark and Robbo's one which was basically Cooley and Bunnahabhainn. Wasn't a particularly exciting whiskey either but no SWA fuss at the time. I think maybe Bruichladdich and SWA don't see eye to eye.</div>
