				<div class="content">Finished a lovely dinner of Steak &amp; spuds washed down with porter  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />Anyway a bit bloated and as it's friday so decided to break out the whiskey earlier than normal.<br /><br />Last drop from a bottle of Lagavulin 16yo which made a nice large one  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />This is an evergreen in my stock ... I actually opened another one a couple of months ago so that it was well seasoned when this one was finished  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> <br /><br />Anyway this whisky is one of the all time classics ... an islay which has heavy layers of smoke which is like having wafts of smoldering fires in your glass ... but in no way harsh ... actually very smooth, silky smooth with velvety rich sherry.<br /><br />A stunning creation and one of my all time favourites.<br /><br />What say the rest of ye  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">When I want a smooth Islay rather than a big in your face monster Lagavulin  is my &quot;go to&quot; whiskey.<br />I find it incredibly complex and smoky the opposite to my other favourite Islay 10yo Laphroaig.<br /><br />Note: I was give a bottle of the distillers reserve Lagavulin but didn't enjoy it as much - it was very dark and little too much for my palate..<br /><br />willie</div>
