				<div class="content">I hear what you're saying IWC however I can still pick up a bottle in the UK from £70 - £88 depending on the outlet. Even with the currency differential that is still a much, much better deal than anything I've ever seen on this side of the water. The argument is 'old-hat' of course at this stage. Clearly the UK (and Euro) retailers are more interested in turning over stock by being more price competitive. I would imagine that come the 2011 release date here there will still be ample stocks of 2008, 2009 &amp; 2010 available. As a by the way, with that much stock kicking about I can't see how IDL manage to seriously stand over the 'VR' status of the beverage!</div>

The whole premise of Midleton has always been to be a premium product. It's just a shame that they do the same with the Jameson Gold and 18yo which I feel is totally out of line with both relavant market prices in other countries and position for similar products but then we now have Redbreast 15 which is a positive move in the right direction.</div>

				<div class="content">if they reduce the price of the Midleton VR, then the old bottles will lose their value as collectible items, and the hardly got together full collections will worth a lot less,<br /><br /> the VR is known the most sought after collectable Irish whiskey know everywhere in the world, they be mad to reduce that price<br /><br /> as a collector, i like to get them cheaper, but if it is too cheap, than it is not worth too much in the future<br /><br />as Redbreast 15 was only 120 in Ireland, everywhere else 60-75, and now it is back to the normal price here too, <br />but the VR was always around the 120-140 mark, except a few duty free shop in the UK airports</div>

				<div class="content">I suppose the other point is that we're looking at this from the viewpoint of &quot;amateur whiskey experts&quot;, if you know what I mean. For most people who like Irish whiskey but aren't into it in a mad way, this is the ultimate Irish whiskey. I think that's mostly based on the price and the fact that it is very very smooth.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm tasting this now alongside the 2008 and 2009 vintage. Funnily enough, in the context of a discussion on another topic about whether caramel is added, the 2010 seems slightly darker in colour than the other 2. <br /><br />Impression so far are the 2008 has the best nose - clean non sherried pot still. Can't get as much off the other 2 but I do have a bit of a cold. 2008 though I can definitely get - it's been open a while, the other 2 just tonight - can that have an effect, in this case positive.<br /><br />Will come back on taste shortly.</div>

				<div class="content">The 2008 is my favourite. I haven't read JM's review but I can see where he's coming from in terms of caramelisation. It's possible that average age of the whiskeys is slightly older and that there's a natural caramelisation going on but the clean pot still that's there on the 08 seems a little more overpowered by something quite sweet on the other, particularly the 10. Then again, I smoke so my taste buds are probably in bits anyway.</div>

However a lot of whiskeys that seem closed when you first open the bottle seem to reveal themselves aftera fwe weeks. It's all part of the fun really.<br /><br />I have 3 powers open ... a PPS and late70's/80's blend and a current one ... quite intersting but my head  is wrecked (tired and can't really concentrate on them  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>
