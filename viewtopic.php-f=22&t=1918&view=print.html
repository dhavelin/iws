				<div class="content">Very kind of you to say.<br /><br />I don't directly check the blog feeds much since I got into Twitter. I follow a ton of bloggers there and find I'm dipping into many more blogs than I otherwise would have, by following enticing tweeted links. I feel I'm reading a virtual Irish whiskey blog, contributed to by many of the world's whiskey bloggers.<br /><br />The other thing about Twitter is that much content that would have ended up in a blog article now goes there instead. I used to do &quot;round up&quot; articles, for example, but I now just tweet the short items as I hear them. Not because I think that's better, but because it saves a huge amount of time.<br /><br />Oliver and Tim are great because neither does the press release copy-and-paste thing, they don't hide their opinions and they go into lots of depth.</div>
