				<div class="content">I was in Dublin earlier this month.  Had a great time.  I was so sad to leave.  I am a big fan of Irish whiskey and am lucky enough to have a good variety here in Jacksonville FL.  I could not wait to try Green Spot and drank that most of the time in Dublin as you can not get it in the states.  I brought back a bottle of that as well as the Palace 9 yr.  My biggest regret is not picking up a bottle of Yellow Spot and a 2nd Green Spot in the duty free store at the airport on the way home.  E32 for Green Spot there!!  How could I have been so short sighted.  My question is this....I am placing an order through the whiskey exchange and they seem to have both yellow and green for about the prices I saw at duty free shop in Dublin since I am outside the EU and not subject to VAT.  Are there any Americans on the board who have used this site?  Will the bottles get to me?  Have you been forced to pay tax in the US?  <br /><br />Also, assuming this works, I am open to suggestions on other whiskeys not available in the US.  We only have Tyrconnell single malt, not the aged bottles.  We also have most all the Bushmills and Jameson.  We have Rebreast 12 and 15(my fav whiskeys of all time) but not cask strength.  Let me know of any recommendations you may have.  I tried Teeling at Kehoes in Dublin.  Loved it.  Heard they may be adding US market soon.  Hope so.<br /><br />Thanks all!  I look forward to being a contributor to the forum.</div>

				<div class="content">hey David, i used to live in San Francisco and, when i was there, i got my green spot fix via the Celtic Whiskey Shop's website and the bottles always came. Similarly, i have friends stateside who use that site and i've never heard any complaints. Given shipping, its best to make a bulk order that'll last a while rather than one bottle at a time if you're planning on more than one. Cant speak for ordering Irish whiskey into the states via WhiskyExchange as i've never used it but i hope that helps?</div>

				<div class="content">The Whisky Exchange is usally good for dilevery to the states also. I know many state siders that use the site. However I believe it depends on the state. I would contact TWE directly and ask if they already ship to your area. They will be straight with you as they don't want to lose shipments either. The are a good professional outfit.<br /><br />As above the Celtic Whiskey Shop in Dublin do a good trade to the US too and you can also avail of the reduced rate from them also.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>
