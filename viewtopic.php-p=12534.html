			<div class="content">All,<br /><br />I am an editor working on a collection of short stories with an Irish theme.  One of the writers singled out Powers as the drink of choice in County Westmeath in his story.  As we want accuracy, even though these are works of fiction, I was wondering if anyone knows what the whiskey preferences are (by and large) in Irish counties, esp. pre-World War II.<br /><br />If anyone has ANY info on Irish Whiskey preferences in ANY counties, I can always extrapolate from there.<br /><br />Thanks to all!<br /><br />Kellard<br /><br /><br />Edit from Admin: Moved from Society  to Whiskey Forum. Thanks for posting  though interesting question.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Kellard,welcome to the forum.<br />I'm from Wexford. I also work in a bar.<br />The current favourite is Jameson. You would find that nationally i would assume.<br />Historically Power &amp; Son would have been the favourite. The reason for this is that the Power family lived in Edermine house near Enniscorthy. They also built the village of Oilgate for their workers. A large number of people from the village went on to work for the family in their distillery in Dublin. <br />Powers would still be favoured by older people. It is also the Whiskey of choice for Hot Whiskeys.</div>

			<div class="content">At this stage it is a hard one to call as you'd really need to be able to do local research amongst life time whiskey drinkers to see where original string holds would have been. Jameson was always a huge seller abroad while Powers was bigger in Ireland. So did Jameson concentrate on export and Powers on Local. I honestly don't think it is as clear as that. Both were Dublin whiskey's but enjoyed success through out Ireland. <br /><br />As previously said Powers out sold Jameson in Ireland up until a few years ago but Jameson has always been strong here too. There would be strong holds of the big 3 all over Ireland. The big 3 being Jameson, Paddy &amp; Powers.  <br /><br />I reckon it could even be as mad as locality to locality. As G-W-H said Powers was well liked in Wexford and I know that in Nearby south Kilkenny Powers was the more go to Whiskey too as Power is a strong family name there also. Paddy obviously would have been strong in the south and cork especially. But in neighboring Kerry I know for a fact that Jameson was a big seller too. In my local area in the West of Ireland, Jameson is with out doubt the big seller with the regular whiskey drinkers but whether that is true in the more built up areas I could not say. <br /><br />I was asked to organize a whiskey reception for a wedding a few years back. So due to orders Jameson Paddy, Powers regular were on offer along with Jameson 12yo,Redbreast 12yo and Midleton. As with all free drink the most expensive seems to go the quickest so half the Midleton was cleared, plenty of Jameson and some Jameson 12yo, hardly any Redbreast but to my surprise the most sampled was Paddy with only a couple of inches left in the bottle.<br /><br />It's something I've thought about on and off over the years but I cannot say there is any clear reasoning and you would really need local knowledge.</div>

			<div class="content">All -<br /><br />Great information!  I appreciate the knowledge and willingness to remember back.  The detail is also helpful, esp. the note on how to tell what's popular in a particular pub.  Having never worked in a pub or restaurant, it helps getting these insights from the pros.<br /><br />If in your own asking around you get more info, PLEASE send it my way - esp. if you know anyone in Westmeath or Mullingar proper.<br /><br />I will be sure to give you, collectively some recognition as the writing project proceeds! <br /><br />Slainte!</div>
