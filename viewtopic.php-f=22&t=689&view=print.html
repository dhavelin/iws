				<div class="content">Actually, I don't see info there but it will be posted. <br /><br />Here's something from whiskymag...<br /><br />This year the Bushmills Master Distiller Colum Egan has taken the<br />unprecedented step of offering to share his unique life in Bushmills for 30<br />days. This global opportunity will see one person spend 30 days at the heart<br />of the area and community that was granted a licence to distil in 1608.<br /><br />If they can prove to Colum that they have captured the special Bushmills<br />way of life and 'Make it at Bushmills,' then at the end of their 30 days,<br />they will get to be the first ever person outside of the distillery to create<br />their own blend of Bushmills Irish Whiskey.<br /><br />Set against the stunning backdrop of Ireland's north coast the winner<br />will get to experience the best of Bushmills for those 30 days, from the<br />secrets of making the finest Irish whiskey to discovering the unique<br />personality and sense of adventure that are an integral part of the Bushmills<br />community.<br /><br />Colum Egan said: &quot;This is a fantastic opportunity for someone to<br />come to the home of Bushmills Irish Whiskey and get a truly unique experience of what goes on here. It's a special place filled with special people - we want to show them the very best of what Bushmills and the north coast of Ireland has to offer.<br /><br />&quot;Over the past 400 years we've learned a lot about making great whiskey<br />and a lot about enjoying it! That's something we want to share, from learning<br />how to select the perfect mature whiskey, to learning the best way to catch a<br />good salmon...or even one of our world-famous waves! It's all part of the<br />Bushmills way of life. If someone can prove to us that they have what it<br />takes to 'Make it at Bushmills' then we'd be delighted to let them be the<br />first person outside of the distillery to work alongside me to create their<br />own special blend of Bushmills Irish Whiskey - hopefully it's not too good<br />because I like my job too much!&quot;<br /><br />The global search for someone to ‘Make it at Bushmills’ will give<br />millions of people the chance to apply online through the Bushmills Facebook<br />page. People in participating countries will compete to win a place at<br />Bushcamp, where each of the country winners will try to prove that they have<br />what it takes to be the global winner of the ‘Make it at Bushmills’ challenge.<br /><br />For the winner of Bushcamp, there are the added attractions of a 30 day<br />trip in Ireland for two, luxury penthouse accommodation and £5,000 spending money. T&amp;C's apply.<br /><br />Do you have what it takes to 'Make it at Bushmills'?</div>
