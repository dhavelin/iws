				<div class="content">Old Dublin is no longer available in larger bottles but can still be bought in half or quarter bottles.<br />Have been told that it is a mix of Bushmills and Jameson, a possible reason for it's departure of the shelves<br />since Pernod Recard sold Bushmills to Diagio. An &quot;inoffencive&quot; whiskey as a friend has put it.<br />Tasted a whiskey while in Dublin last week called  &quot;The Dubliner&quot;, this tasted of Cadbury Chrunchie......different.<br />Just don't get the 2 confused.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Old Dublin which I think is now no more ... was cheap blend created by IDL circa Mid 90's to Mid 2000's. However I could be corrected on that. <br /><br />Possibly still available in old stock in obscure shops.<br /><br />&quot;Possibly&quot; created to try and be a competitor to the influx of cheap Cooley private and supermarket blends.  <br /><br />There has been a few versions of it ... basically style changes. Originally in a Dimple(esque) stlye bottle but 2 dimples (Front and rear) rather than 3 as of Dimple.<br /><br /><br />(Edit: Tallu B beat me to it and sounds like a good explanation  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> )</div>

IDL had decided in 1970 to stop selling casks to merchants and Gilbey's recieved their last casks in 1971 when the Jameson Distillery in Dublin Closed. Gilbeys exhaused their stock in 1985 and that was the end of Redbreast under Gilbeys. These were basically created using some of the last unused casks that Gilbey's had in stock. Even though some much older whiskey has gone into these 12yo bottling's alot of them were tired casks that were gone past their best hence the under whelming bottles that came out at that time. It coul of died a death there and then but luckily IDL aquired the brand and relaunched it in the early 90's.</div>

Went back there and found much more added but still is missing a lot. Now you can say whether your bottle is open or not.</div>
