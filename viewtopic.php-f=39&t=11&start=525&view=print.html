				<div class="content">Hi, <br /><br />My name is Gary, I live in Germany and have my business here in Paderborn, not too far from Hannover. The family is originally from Clontarf, although the majority of the family is scattered across the globe these days, the older generation still living in and around Clontarf.<br /><br />I used to dislike whiskey intensely when I was younger preferring rum, I  could never come to terms with peaty whisky which always reminded me of TCP which Mum and Nana used to apply to our childhood scrapes and cuts. I first started enjoying Whiskeys about 10 years ago whilst visiting my cousin Paul in Munich. He has his own Irish Pub with a huge selection of Whiskey. It was whilst there that we decided to have a few drinks in memory of my granddad who was a great fan of Powers. I had expected to be cringing at the first sip, but was pleasently surprised, inevitably one drink became two and so on...... Ever since then my interest in Irish whiskey and its history has grown and continues to do so, I particularly love Pot Still, but I am not a whiskey snob and like a wide range of blends, single malts and grains. I do still however have my peated Whiskey phobia, but there are not too many of those currently in terms of Irish Whiskeys and plenty of the those without to keep me going.<br /><br />I try to get back to Dublin a few times a year and always make a pilgrimage to Dawson Street to see what the Celtic Whiskey Shop has  es on the shelves<br /><br />Well that should do for a hello post, wishing you all the best of fun enjoying Irish Whiskey and sending you all the best from Germany <br />Sláinte Gary</div>

				<div class="content">Cheers Will,<br /><br />Great to be back and looking forward to catching up with everyone once I'm back at work in Dublin in coming weeks.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of working with with many other nationalities during my year away and was introduced to several Austrian Whiskeys. I also had a friendly Whiskey war with a Scottish colleague who was also a whisky aficionado.<br /><br />I received a fascinating insight into Balkan Rakias from Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Not just the normal  Šljivovica which is made from Plums / Damsons, but also sister spirits made from Quince, Cherry, Pear, Williams Pear (there is a difference!!), Apricot, Mountain Herbs and Grasses and even Walnut. Every village has several active home distillation projects and the quality was very very good. I brought you back a small sample for when we next meet up.<br /><br />Busy for the last week working on the Irish Whiskey Trail  <a href="http://WhiskeyTrail.ie" class="postlink">http://WhiskeyTrail.ie</a> and the Dublin Whiskey Trail <a href="http://DublinWhiskeyTrail.ie" class="postlink">http://DublinWhiskeyTrail.ie</a> websites.

There's a whiskey museum near Trinity College in Dublin City centre and they'll have some info. There's a section with Distillery Pictures and information on this forum.

				<div class="content">Hi to all @ Irish Whiskey Society <br /><br />Seamus here , ive been collecting Irish Whiskey &amp; Red Wine for a few years now , originaly the wine was used in the Kitchen as a bit of decoration and to fill some empty shelves  and it has since turned into a bit more than that . My Grandfather on my dads side was the owner of ''The Ulster Bar '' in Belturbet Co.Cavan in the 1940's and he had a bottling company in the 50's / 60's , my father went on to be a bartender in a number of Dublin pubs , growing up in Dublin i spent some time in pubs on both north and the south side of the River Liffey , sadly at the time i didnt appreciate Irish whiskey and everything that was Irish Whiskey , my Mother tells me that her parents would treat themselves to a bottle of Crested ten a few times each year and if they had money to spare maybe a bottle of Redbreast or a Bushmills .<br /><br />Now here i am some 20 years later after spending so much time as a kid in Irish pubs &amp; snugs buying Whiskey for myself hoping that 1 day i will have the pallet to appreciate a good Irish Whiskey , currentley i only have a smell/taste a few times each year , i do a lot of driving for a living including nights and weekends so cant afford to indulge too much , im still growing my collection at a bout 1-2 bottles per month anything Irish pot still / Single Malt / Blended / grain , the hope is to one day put an old Garage at home  currentley unused to good use and have somewhere nice to display my Whiskey collection and other old world pub stuff . i see there is an area on the Forum where i can post a list of Whiskies in my collection which i will do later this week , i hope to spend a bit more time online getting to know members of the forum and Irish Whiskey Society members .<br /><br />Many thanks <br /><br />Seamus</div>

				<div class="content">Howrya?<br /><br />Been a lurker for a while but decided to get involved. <br /><br />I've been &quot;collecting&quot; Irish whiskeys for about 2 years now in a very amateur way. I travel a lot so spend a lot of my time at The Loop checking what I can afford, but have recently got involved in some auction sites. <br /><br />My main weakness is pretty much everything from a certain Distillery east of Cork City - though single pot stills will always be my &quot;go-to&quot;. My wifes parents live 15 mins away so its always a pitstop when I'm down there. <br /><br />Looking forward to being involved in the discussions here and there. <br /><br />All the best, <br /><br />Claw</div>
