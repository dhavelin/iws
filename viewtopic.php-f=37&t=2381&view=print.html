				<div class="content">2014 has been another great year for us Irish Whiskey fans.<br /><br />New distilleries popping up every other month and some changing hands. <br /><br />We had lots of new arrivals again although we haven't got our expected quota of Pot Stills! we still have a couple of weeks left.<br /><br />The Irish Whiskey society Cork chapter has grown very quickly. The Dublin branch is filling venues regularly even with the larger capacity. Word on the street and in the fields is that a few more chapters are planned in the new year. <br /><br />We've had tastings outside of Cork and Dublin again this year and hopefully this will expand too.<br /><br />I wish all a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. <br /><br />Sl√°inte,<br /><br />W</div>
