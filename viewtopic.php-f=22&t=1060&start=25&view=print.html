				<div class="content">I have. I'll consider anything. What we need is full list of added ingredients on the labels, so if consistency is your primary requirement you don't have to read the label, you can just look at the colour, and purchase.

People do think it's older, or from fresher casks, or from sherry casks. <br /> <br /> <br />( Didn't they ban the use of paxarette over concerns of it being overused, not quite the same thing but still, shows that they know of such principals, iirc )</div>

But water is a palate cleanser, not a complex soup of volatile flavours and esters. If e150 does coat and inhibit the palate ( for quite some time with some individuals ) what is to be gained by tasting water afterwards, or at the same time. ( also: this will be difficult to prove if only some people are sensitive, e.g. look at sulphur ). All MoM proved is that those particular testers could not detect 'their' e150a sample in water.</div>

The addition of caramel to some whiskeys goes far beyond the amount needed for batch consistency.<br /><br />The use of caramel got grandfathered into law not because it's a good thing or a necessary thing but because distillers were using it for whatever purpose and they told the legislators what to write in the statute books. Perhaps laws should be framed for consumers (proper labelling) or for the reputation of this island's food and drink industry as a whole (&quot;Irish produce is natural and additive-free&quot;).</div>

In my mind it holds more weight than the anecdotal 'some people say...'. I also like that MoM encourage people to experiment with E150 for themselves, to make up their own minds.

Possibly as many are unaware that (some) whisky is artificially coloured. I've told 'non-whiskey anorak friends' who were shocked and surprised ( and ultimately disappointed ). I stated before that a little education can go a long way. There are two Glenmorangie Originals on a supermarket shelf, one claims to be &quot;Free Of Artificial Colouring&quot;, and the other states &quot;Contains Artificial Colouring That <span style="font-weight: bold">May</span> Interfere With Flavour For Some Individuals&quot;.

This has been one of the main bug bears that people have in relation to IDL, and the fact that these conflicts are out there. Therefore the comment on the use of E150a kind of explains the how come all this confusion has happened. Not sure if I would go as far as saying it as a bomb shell though. I have to admit that it does not overly bother me. But that is neither here not there. However what is positive is that we know know that IDL are happy to talk about what exactly they are doing. <br /><br />I know that it will probably not make any difference to you but what David Quinn was highlighting is that it is more of a scenario of shading rather than colouring and the amounts they use are even more minimal than normal blends from other distilleries. The Midleton whiskey (even Bourbon casks) have a decent amount of colour in them in comparison to the Bourbon casks of many other distilleries.  One of the reasoning behind it is that they want to make sure that their whiskeys do not have an identical colour which is very possibly with similar age stated whiskeys.</div>
