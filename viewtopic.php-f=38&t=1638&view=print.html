Not sure what the other one was but you have tried two of the best Irish whiskeys there anyway, in my opinion.</div>

				<div class="content">Dave, I always remember you commenting to me about there being a reason for single malt ((basicly the flavour) Truly i was shocked to find all 3 of the whiskeys so noticably diferent in taste. In all my 70 years i never even gave it  much thought. <br />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> My visitor has renewed my entheuseasm to  mash some of my barley  malt and also to gain more knowledge. We discussed ageing and oaking for quite some time.<br /><br />Unfortunately because of my health in the past 2 years, i didnt have a drop of any of my home made to let him evaluate.</div>

I still have 35 pounds of barley malt left. I will have to deviate from my single malt idea and just do  an irish whiskey recipe. I just purchased 50 usa pounds of  flaked barley-unmalted 22.7 kilos<br /><br /> The recipe i will use is 75% unmalted barley and 25% malted barley. I'm not using the wheat, rye and oats in an attempt to try to get a single grain profile if there is such a thing.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>can you give me a recipe for a beer that is typically Irish. Ihave all the equipment and a converted fridge. but never made beer.</div></blockquote><br />Apologies for being off the radar for a while.  Here's a stout receipe that works ... gave me a very close approximation to bottled Guinness which I quite like.<br /><br />Volume: 2 gallons<br />1oz Northern Brewer hops (in boil 25 min)<br />1oz Fuggles hops (in boil 10 min)<br />2lb malt extract (liquid)<br />6oz crushed crystal malt<br />8oz black malt<br />1oz chololate malt<br />1oz roasted barley<br />1oz wheat malt<br />2oz brown rice<br />1tsp salt<br />2 tbsp+ strong brewed tea (for tannin)<br /><br />4 tbsp lemon juice<br />1 sachet gervin ale yeast (or other ale yeast)<br /><br />Don't crack the chocolate malt.<br />Simmer ~6 pints water and stir in the malt extract.<br />Add the grains and 1/2 the hops.<br />Cover &amp; simmer for 15 mins (25 mins in my last batch)<br />Add remaining hops &amp; simmer for another 10 minutes or so.<br />Stop heat &amp; allow to cool.<br />Strain off the contents into a fermenter &amp; add yeast ( plus cold tea &amp; lemon juice).<br />Top up to 2 gallons, ferment and rack to secondary after 7 days. After further 7 days (or when finishing gravity is acheived) prime with corn sugar and bottle. The beer is ready to drink after 6 weeks, but peaked at about 15 months in my case!<br /><br />Its been quite a while (March 2000) since I brewed this, but it was my favourite.<br />Adjust as you like (e.g. some oats/porridge for different mouth feel etc.).<br />Enjoy.<br />Michael</div>
