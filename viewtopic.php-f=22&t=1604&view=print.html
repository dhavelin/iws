				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />We are playing with the idea of an Irish Whiskey locator.<br /><br />Just looking for comments and ideas if people have them.<br /><br />It would be based on Google maps and the Idea is for it to be an Ireland map for the time being. We would need to get together a criteria for inclusion as we probably should only be including premises that are making an effort to have a proper whiskey range or doing their bit in promoting Irish Whiskey.   <br /><br />So get you thinking caps on and let us know what we should be doing.<br /><br />Until then here is a link to a test map to give people an Idea of what we can create. Also if anybody can do some magic with google maps please feel free to volunteer your time. This is just a sample map so don't worry about the comment/descriptions etc as they were done on the fly.<br /><br /><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/irishwhiskeysociety.com/www/reference/irish-whiskey-locator" class="postlink">Irish Whiskey Locator</a></div>

				<div class="content">I think the guys over beoir.org already have the beer side covered.<br /><br />In relation to populating the whiskey map I think we'd need to do it as an IWS approved system or else we'd have every tom, dick &amp; harry with 3 whiskies for sale putting up their pub. So I'm thinking we probably would ask for submissions and we'd then approve and enter the details ourselves.</div>

				<div class="content">We could have a web form set-up to collect the necessary details based on our criteria for assessment.<br />This could be based on no of Irish, scotch, American, Japanese, RoW etc<br />Knowledge of Bar Staff, whiskey Heritage etc<br /><br />We could decide internally on a rating system for each bar, cater for heritage pubs and recommended pubs,<br /><br />Once established we could have an award system, <br /><br />Plenty of scope.</div>
