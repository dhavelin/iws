Definitely got that orange syrupy thing and stale, musty aroma. Dull is a good word too. It just didn't sparkle.</div>

Just whiskey.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">The Bottle in the Bull and Castle has been open for 2 and half years, i know this becasue i opened it.<br /><br />The first measure i had out of it was muck and i re tried about 3 weeks ago (hence the fact there is only half a shot left) and its still bloody muck no worse no better, exactly the same as when i opened it. The seal was good on the bottle (the bottle was bought from the shop and we dont buy/sell bottles with huge evaporation). So im looking forward to opening another bottle of it just to see if it was a dud.</div>
