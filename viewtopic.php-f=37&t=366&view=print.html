				<div class="content">I don't know if there would be much demand within the Irish Whiskey Society for a Burns night, it's more of a Scottish thing - doubt many people over here would be very familiar with his work. <br /><br />The concept of matching food and spirits is becoming more popular, though if I'm having a drink of that nature (i.e. 40% alc. and upwards) I usually prefer it on it's own. <br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">(Two months later...)<br /><br />I agree with the post above, that other folks enjoy St. Patrick's, Oktoberfest, and other assorted ethnic and national festivals, so why not enjoy a Burns dinner? I'm always up for a meal I don't often have. (I'm addicted to food shows on the Food Network here in the US). I also agree with the posts above that good uische beatha should be enjoyed with a sprinkle of water to release the angels, and little else (as in, not during a meal).<br /><br /><br /><br />Gleanntan ni Cheleigh</div>
