What you get is this intense spice bust in the taste but that is washed away quickly going into the finished which initially is sweet. I don't mean the spice only last a short time what I mean is that is seems to very suddenly disappear as you head into the finish.

That seems to be there for quite a long bit after.<br /><br />I was totally at sea for a while on this until I remembered JohnM mentioned the envelope glue and he is totally correct it is there for me too.<br /><br />Still a really enjoyable whiskey and very rewarding.  <br /><br />If I get the opportunity I'm going to try this with a cigar this week as the full sweet flavours strike me as something that would go well with a cigar.

				<h3>YELLOW SPOT and Cigar (Cohiba Siglo II)</h3>

This is a medium cigar but I suppose it is also a smooth cigar so something more robust would possibly be a better match. I was not complaining though as I enjoyed the experience at the same time, just being hyper critical.</div>

				<div class="content">I noticed Irish Distillers have changed their taste profile for Yellow Spot.<br />When it came out in was originally described as more delicate and closer to Barry Crockett Legacy, but slightly sweeter.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://singlepotstill.com/spswhiskeys.do?menuId=3&amp;url=sps_whiskeys_landing_page">http://singlepotstill.com/spswhiskeys.d ... nding_page</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I personally found it a little spicier but I don't profess to be good at detecting these things.<br /><br />I would have though Redbreast 15 more robust that the 12 as they describe it. <br /> <br />Has anyone any opinions on where they would place the various whiskeys on the profile grid?</div>
