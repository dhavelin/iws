				<div class="content">Dear Irish Whiskey fan,<br /><br />This forum will be closed to all new discussion from next weekend (10 March 2018).<br /><br />The world moves on and the society running its own server, database and forum software is an anachronism. There are other venues for discussion on the internet these days and most users have already migrated there. The Irish Whiskey Society itself has outposts on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IrishWhiskeySociety/" class="postlink">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/IrishWhiskeySoc" class="postlink">Twitter</a>.<br /><br />The plan is to preserve the information and chat in this forum by taking a snapshot of it before it closes. We will then upload the snapshot to the same web address (that's our hope anyway).<br /><br />Thank you very much for all your contributions over many years.<br /><br />The forum is dead, long live Irish whiskey discussion!</div>

				<div class="content">A very regressive decision David. I’m very disappointed that the full potential of this resource was not fully explored by the Society, and it’s being dropped in favour of Twitter?!!! Hardly like for like. The preservation of the information is obviously the most important deliverable now it would appear anyway. If there is any risk to that and equally if there is to be any likely impediment to members being able to freely access it, then this process should stop immediately.</div>

Twitter is a forum I associate with the Great Leader and I<br />do not mean the little round guy in Asia. Twitter is not a forum for serious discussion<br />or exchange of information. It would appear that it is not even certain that the <br />information contained  in the forum will survive in any format. Membership cards <br />went a few years ago etc. etc. What is there left for members outside of Dublin ???<br />At this stage now that an undemocratic decision has been taken to close the forum <br />why not go for a full re-brand and relaunch as the 'Dublin Whiskey Society' ????? because<br />that in essence is the way the Society is going.</div>

				<div class="content">This is very sad. I discovered this site as my interest in Irish whiskey grew and as the explosion of brands, collectible and otherwise, occurred around me.  Then and now I have not found a finer collection of Irish whiskey lovers on the internet. That said, it’s been pretty dead. Not much conversation to go with the proliferation of our favorite tipple. I will miss knowing where to go for great advice.  Take care everyone!</div>
