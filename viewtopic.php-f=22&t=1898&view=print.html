				<div class="content">Recently published Travel book with a difference entitled ' The Wet and the Dry' by Lawrence Osborne<br />published by Harvill Secker @ 12.99 Sterling ( Ebook also available ) Excellent read about the author's search<br />for a drink in supposedly dry Islamic countries and his visits to breweries,wineries and distilleries. In some<br />cases as with the winery in Egypt owned by two Lebanese they only see five years left for them as things are<br />getting harsher. Most unusual whiskey must be the blended Malt 'Gymkhana' made in Rawalpindi, Pakistan whose <br />combined brewery/distillery he visited ( a 21 year old is also made there neither of which are available outside Pakistan )</div>

				<div class="content">Very interesting book I just read over the Christmas period 'Shackleton's Whisky' by Neville Peat and<br />published by Preface books 2013. Details the Shackleton 'British Antarctic Expedition' 1907/09  and<br />the discovery in 2007 of crates of Mackinlay 10 yr. old Malt Whiskey from that Expedition secreted <br />under the original hut in Antarctica. Extremely tedious work in retrieving same and thawing out the <br />box -- the whiskey never froze as when tested it was 47.19 a.b.v. which would have required  minus <br />34.3 degrees . Whyte &amp; Mackay who now own the brand re-created the 1907 bottling and did 50,000<br />bottles at £100 each in the U.K. when launched. Recommended read. I got mine in waterstone's, Cork<br />which cost Euros 21.50.</div>

				<div class="content">Do they mention any of the other whisky brought on the expedition? Shackleton brought Irish whiskey too, and drank it... Also brandy, I think. <br /><br />I got &quot;The Science and Commerce of Whisky&quot; for Christmas.</div>

				<div class="content">Shackleton had Irish Quaker roots being born at Kilkea near Ballitore the Quaker settlement <br />in Co. Kildare and was himself according to the book fairly abstemious. No mention whatsoever <br />of Irish whiskey on the voyage -- the original order still survives. The Brandy and Port are not <br />specified by name but some of this was recovered as well and it was Australian Brandy from <br />the Hunter Valley. The Brandy loaded in London though was likely from France.</div>

				<div class="content">That's interesting. I know I read somewhere that they brought Irish whiskey on the expedition and consumed it. The scotch was the stuff that was left. Me reading it somewhere is no guarantee it's true, of course. I'll have look into that.</div>

				<div class="content">During the War of Independence in North Cork an interesting use was made of Irish whiskey bottles <br />(Recycling was not invented in the last 20/30 years)by the local people who kept watch out for the <br />Flying Columns to prevent attempts of encirclement by the enemy.Empty bottles were filled with an <br />inch of water and the bottom was heated over a flame which consequently fell off.What remained was <br />called a 'Conchie' no doubt after the Conch shell which was used as a horn to send signals 'which were <br />loud and created a disquieting sound at night'. They could be disposed of easily in hedgerows until<br />required again. This little nugget is in<span style="font-weight: bold"> 'Sean Moylan Rebel Leader' by Aideen Carroll.</span> Mercier press <br />of Cork 2010. It is about the well known &amp; respected commander of Cork no.2 Brigade who was afterwards <br />a T.D. and Government minister.</div>

				<div class="content">Dave Broom is fantastic in general and the above is an excellent comprehensive guide (if it's the book i think it is, it's also the only world whiskey guide that goes into any technical depth whatsoever about Midleton's peculiar distillation procedures...)</div>
