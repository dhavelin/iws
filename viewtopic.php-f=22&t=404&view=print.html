				<div class="content">i know this may sound silly, but i would really love to get involved in the process of distilling whisk(e)y.  ive been in ireland now for 2 years and cannot find any work.  its really bad, but i wont bore you with the details.  anyway, i was wondering if anyone knew of how to get involved.  im guessing its a hard job to come by and its all &quot;who you know.&quot;  i was looking into classes for distilling, and the only thing i could find was some learn from home course based out of scotland.  it dealt with chemistry and bio for the distilling process.  im assuming even if you did pass the course, it would be extremely hard to get a job distilling.  i would think it would be one of those jobs that takes years to get right .  maybe an apprenticeship?  to be honest, i would love to just be one of the workers in the storehouse.  and then possibly work my way up to other things.  me and my wife are currently looking at moving out of western ireland.  we def. want to go somewhere in the UK...possibly up north.  but we would go anywhere if a job came up.  im a pisces so i am a natural born dreamer.  so dont be too hard on me, haha</div>

				<div class="content">Not really addressing the job hunt problem, but definitely should help with the dreaming bit ... see my earlier post re a book &quot;The Art of Distilling Whiskey and other spirits&quot; posted <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="viewtopic.php-f=34&amp;t=375.html" class="postlink">here</a></span>.<br /><br />More directly related: Bruichladdich run something called <a href="http://www.bruichladdich.com/the_academy.htm" class="postlink">The Academy</a> - &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">Experience ‘hands-on’  the art of  distilling - the Victorian way.  Stay for 4 nights in the Distillery Manager’s house,  limited to a maximum of 6 guests, you will work alongside our craftsmen on a one-to-one basis as they go about their craft of milling, mashing, distilling, tasting and bottling our whisky. ...
