				<div class="content">I wonder how it will affect the brands ... Beam also own Laphroaig ... is a good or bad thing for Connemara?<br /><br />Will they continue with all stable brands currently available?<br /><br />Will they continue supplying independents?<br /><br />They have the clout to progress both distilleries immensely but will it be to the expense of fringe brands?<br /><br />Will be very interesting how Beam proceed.</div>

				<div class="content">They're buying it because of the growth potential of Irish whiskey, so I don't think they'll be holding it back in any way. It already has practically zero effect on Laphroaig sales, I'd say. I wouldn't know about the fringe brands. Maybe if they focus more sales in the US, they won't have the stock to supply others? Please keep in mind that I don't know what I'm talking about. <br /><br />I suppose it means, as we probably know already, that William Grant won't be buying Cooley, so an extra distillery is even more likely.</div>

Maybe the offer was there for a while, and once the euro weakened, they jumped. I have no idea, of course. And the euro may weaken further against the dollar down the road.</div>

				<div class="content">Currencies fluctuate all the time for sure, certainly the dollar is strong against the euro at the moment but those things matter less than eg. the manner in which they structure the offer/take-over. My opinion on this is that it is a really strange time to sell, also because they made such a massive deal over being the only independent, fully Irish distillery. As soon as someone came along with enough spare change to throw around they sold up and bailed out. I guess I was too beguiled by the patriotic mumbo jumbo being spouted that I forgot that the main man was just in there to make a reasonably 'quick' buck. Like I said, shame. <br />I hope at least the employees get looked after in all of this.</div>

				<div class="content">A reasonably quick buck is a harsh assessment, this is a culmination of 25 years of effort by the owners/shareholders. Of course its sad to see it in foreign ownership but that's business. But Cooley is riding high at the moment, and it  has been looking for a strategic partner on and off for a long time now.<br /><br />Nobody is complaining in IDL at the support they get from Pernod Ricard. This could be the making of Cooley yet.<br /><br />Good news for the category, in my view.</div>

				<div class="content">In the greater scheme of things, even 25 years is reasonably quick Leo. Also, in contrast with your IDL example, I'm sure there is an equal number of employees at Bushmills who regret the Diageo deal. All in all, as much as this is good news for Cooley shareholders (though I'm not really convinced it is), it is not so for the Irish whiskey enthusiast. Deals like this always come with non-compete clauses so it will be interesting to see what gets sidelined over time.</div>

				<div class="content">I really don't think you can call â¬76 million a bargain. The company only had sales of â¬16 million last year. There are very few businesses i can imaging selling for 5 times turnover, never mind profit, especially at the moment. Also as John pointed out it's interesting  in the context of Bushmills, a much bigger brand. It's an interesting insight into how distilleries are valued if nothing else. Clearly the brand names and the huge levels of maturing whiskey are big considerations as well as the usual profit and turnover issues. Then again I'm an accountant so maybe I'm the only one who thinks this is interesting.</div>
