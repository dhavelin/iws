				<div class="content">well folks, its official.  i will be moving back to america on june 10th.  the economy has officially won the battle.  never got to meet any of you, but i enjoyed learning and reading on this forum.  i will still be frequenting the site from america and hell, now i can get irish whiskey cheaper!  :low blow:  going back to the suburbs of philadelphia to live around my parents.  not fair on the wife to be working here full time with me doing nothing, so we are just going to start a new life.  who knows, maybe we will come back here later in life.  right now, its just not feasible for us to be living here.  special thanks to adrian who sent me those samples and gave me a lot of info.  thanks to him i was guided in the right direction to start up my own collection.  i might have to sell the whisk(e)y and if not it will be stashed at my father in laws house for future visits, lol.  not sure i can bring open bottles in checked luggage and it will be $$$$ to ship them over.  sucksssss</div>

Some Single Malt drinkers can be the most frustrating whisky drinkers in this way. Basically if it is not a single malt they can turn their noses up to it yet they are some amazing high quality blends on the market and a lot of the Irish whiskeys are blends and alot are of an amazingly high quality.</div>

				<div class="content">Add me to the Northeast USA chapter.<br /><br />You folks over there have plenty of company here. I read somewhere that the Irish are the #2 in number of immigrants here, after the Germans. (That might need to be updated, due to the mass influx of Hispanics). Anyway, there are a lot of Irish here. There is an area of the central New Jersey shore that is called the &quot;Irish Riviera&quot;, and the concentration of Irish is greater in this six-town area than even New York City and Boston.<br /><br />We're in good hands over here.</div>

				<div class="content">Don't know if Germans drink much whiskey. German spirits are not great (to me). I do respect them for their beer. Can't improve on perfection!<br /><br />West of where I live was a enclave of Irish coal miners (the story of the Molly Maguires is from this part of the state) and there were small Gaeltachts there, where little if any English was spoken.<br /><br />GSC is correct about the Irish Riviera on the Jersey Shore. Our cousin lives right in the middle of this area, and there is a huge Irish influence in everything there.</div>
