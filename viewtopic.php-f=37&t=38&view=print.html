				<div class="content">Just an idea for consideration. In order to develop the society in a meaningful way and to introduce a base level of knowledge for members who would like to know more, perhaps it would be a good idea to develop our own 'training' curriculum. Educational materials should be relatively easy to source and I'm sure that some of the master distillars etc would consider giving the odd specialist lecture from time to time within a given programme? A distance learning format would perhaps be best? I think it would help to establish ourselves as a 'whiskey fountain of knowledge'?!!<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">There are a few things on various sites that can be used for this and we can easily link into them ....<br /><br />Another good idea to chat about at the meeting <br /><br />I also have a nosing kit which we could use one night briefly and give people the basics at what they should be looking out for.</div>

				<div class="content">Good idea John.  I think that the training should be aimed at asserting the distinctiveness of Irish Whiskey.  The nosing and tasting course from Whisky Mag is useful for sure, but very generic.  I reckon there should be an effort to raise awareness of the different styles, etc.  <br /><br />Also, the tasting wheel on WM was designed by Charlie MacLean et al for Scotch Malt and may not be the perfect device for Irish Whiskey.  I'm speculating here, but I know that when exploring bourbon for instance (no comparison implied) I find myself selecting descriptors from a small section of the wheel, because the wheel was not designed for it.  I guess its likely that Irish Whiskey will be much closer in style to Scotch, but there may be room for reevaluation of the wheel.  <br /><br />It would be good to see the development of truly Irish-specific knowledge.</div>

				<div class="content">Good points Willie .... even though we do have a few peated offerings there is no real sign of iodine or medicinal tastes in Irish that I am aware of. However every thing else may come into play wood fruit honey etc <br /><br />View Whisky Mag<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><a href="http://www.whiskymag.com/gfx/nosing/Whiskywheel-Big.jpg" class="postlink">Tasting Wheel</a></span></div>

				<div class="content">That's a great idea. Maybe a pack of minis of the main brands for self-study, with notes supplied on the website? Or maybe a shop would do a deal on such a pack if you show your membership card?</div>

				<div class="content">I think we could put together an Introduction to Irish Whiskey tasting night that could be part of a membership package and also available to visitors/tourists etc.<br />We could run it sporadically throughout the year.<br />I'm not claiming to be the best palate around, but I've tasted beer professionally and written on whiskey for the whisky mags. And I know our esteemed webmaster trained in tasting at UCD and could likely assist in putting together a fun, informative and enlightening evening that could operate as a revenue spinner for the society.</div>

I did an adult ed course at UCD and, while it was very educational, I have a long way to go before I can offer anything like an informed opinion. I am trying to get the instructor along to a tasting, however.</div>

				<div class="content">He might be someone to talk to about creating an Irish whiskey specific taste wheel.<br />I could have a word with my old Guinness guru too, though he's strictly beer, really.<br />Mightn't be a bad idea to get the distillers in on it, too? I'm sure they're operating their own individual ones anyway. While I suspect they wouldn't share them with us, they might at least be happy to give us an indication of some of the ways they break down what they're looking for in their products' taste spectra.</div>

				<div class="content">Just another idea about education. We could create a inventory/directoy of Irish whiskey distilleries including distilleries that existed in past. Just looked at Alfred Barnard's book and he mentioned approx. 25 irish distilleries. I'm sure there were more ... not counting the &quot;unofficals&quot;.</div>
