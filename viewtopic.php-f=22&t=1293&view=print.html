				<div class="content">You are better off going to Cooley's distillery in Kilbeggan.  The distillery in Cooley is closed to the pubic.  Also all of the things you would want to see at a distillery are down in Kilbeggan.  There is a museum part that is from the old Lockes Distillery and then there is a new working distillery with wooden washbacks and the worlds oldest copper port still.  Take the motorway from Dublin to Galway and then get off at Kilbeggan.  There are signs on the motorway but it is at exit 5 off the M-6 just before you get to Athlone.  Takes me about an hour and 10 min from the north side of Dublin. <br /><br />Pub wise the Palace Bar at the end of Templebar is always good. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Distiller,<br /><br />but I've been to Kilbeggan maybe a year ago. It was quite nice there!<br />So I guess going up to Dundalk is not worth the time and I think Kilbeggan is to far away as I stay in Howth... mmm, but I see it 's just 10 minutes more than Dundalk, if google maps is right. Maybeeeee...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />Thanks for the adivce!</div>

				<div class="content">You can't just drive up to Cooley in Louth for a tour but they often do pre-arranged tours. You should contact the distillery and ask. The local town of Carlingford is quite picturesque too.</div>

				<div class="content">I would say that you have very little chance of a tour on the weekend in Cooley.  They are building some new warehouses and are not letting the public in for tours.<br /><br />If you have not been down to Kilbeggan since the new mashing and fermenters were installed I would recommend it.<br /><br />The people are very nice! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">that being said, if you have your heart set on the riverstown distillery, there's no harm trying. I once called in to their offices in clontarf and asked nicely if i could come up on a weekend and they were glad to let myself and my cousin sean drive up there and take a look round. It's not as scenic as some of the other distilleries but if you're just there to see the bones of whats going on up there, its rather an interesting place. Worth a call at the very least</div>
