				<div class="content">Really? They couldn't use vodka?<br /><br />Obviously, they think they have a serious problem in that country. Can't say I noticed it. There is a far more menacing atmosphere on Dublin streets than there is in Stockholm.</div>

				<div class="content">Everyone thinks their own country is more dangerous, because sometimes it's harder to recognise the danger when you're abroad. Ireland has a very low violent crime rate, but the papers will make you think you're living in Bogota. <br /><br />Sweden is a relatively safe country, but Ireland is probably safer.</div>

				<div class="content">There are huge problems with Alcoholism in parts of Sweden - especially as you go further north in winter. Probably something to do with lack of sunlight. I work with a guy who sailed up the coast of Sweden and described this police boat that sailed from place to place picking up people for drink related crimes.</div>

There is a public, alcohol-induced menace in Ireland and gangs of openly-drinking scumbags in my own locality and in town that I just didn't see in Sweden, despite spending a year and a half there, in various parts. I've also known plenty of Swedes and can't think of any who had a bad relationship with alcohol (or drugs), unlike the Irish I've known.<br /><br />It's just my own observation, and I admit we haven't had nightclubs shot up or politicians assassinated on the streets in recent years, as has happened in Sweden. But there is something badly wrong in this country when it's unpleasant to go out at night time and be around your fellow citizens.</div>

You are saying we should &quot;transport&quot; Irish undesirables to far-off countries. I'll start drawing up a list...</div>
