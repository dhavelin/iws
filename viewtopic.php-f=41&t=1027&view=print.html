				<div class="content">i bought one about 6 months ago in mint condition (bottle and packaging) for 400 euro. I was talking to people in the CWS and they said they had sold 1984's for over 1,000 euro only a couple of years ago. It might be worth hanging on to it and hope the value goes back up.</div>
