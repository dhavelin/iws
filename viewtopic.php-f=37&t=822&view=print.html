				<div class="content">I will write up the practical aspects of it, ie what whiskey was matched with what cheeses and some details on the whiskey. Later today I'll also update the event page with the whiskey table (and a cheese table).<br /><br />I can't really judge how it went but I think at least that people were happy with the selections of cheese and whiskey, and that it wasn't entirely outrageous to put them together <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>
