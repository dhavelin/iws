				<div class="content">I read in <a href="http://westcorktimes.com/home/archives/33324" class="postlink">West Cork Times</a> that there's a distillery planed for Clear Island in West Cork. They plan to have a visitor centre too. <br /><br />Great new for the people in West Cork to get a distillery. I hope they get the planning and start up. There was a distillery planned for Horse Island a few years back but didn't go ahead. <br /><br />I look forward to visiting them when they are up and running, that's if they'll have me.</div>
