				<div class="content">Just watching Flog It on BBC and they had a Bushmills Millennium 1975 on the show and took it to auction.<br /><br />Bottled specially for UTV <br /><br />Estimate of £40-50<br /><br />Sold for £80.00<br /><br />Which is probably around right for this bottle at auction. <br /><br />Good to see an Irish Whiskey on one of the TV auction programmes.</div>

				<div class="content">It would be nice to be able to get them at £80. This month's auction at McTears saw three of these bottles all go for £100, £100 and £105 respectively, before the 20% commission goes on too.</div>

				<div class="content">You used to be able to get them for about €80. Postage on top, of course. Those were the days. <br />And you could have bought a whole cask for £5,000, including taxes. A very handy deal. <br /><br />I bought several for about €40-45 too. They were drank, passed on a few and gave a few away as table quiz raffle prizes. Won by people who didn't even like whskey, probably. <br /><br />The last few I bought were all more expensive. Still great value, though. <br /><br />I think it's a lovely whiskey. My favourite Bushmills so far. Although I'm not sure all the casks were great.</div>

A real perfumey quality to it which I believe some Bowmore's used to suffer from too. Something to do with sherry casks but can't remember what causes it. Just shows you the risks of buying a cask and not knowing what the end product will be.</div>
