				<div class="content">I'm not a troll,  hear me out.  I decided to see what all the fuss was about,  and ordered a redbreast last week,  10 quid a glass in Dublin city centre. Tried it at room temp without and with a tiny drop of water. <br /><br />I found it very ordinary. There's no real edge to it at all, quite a blunt taste. Got a little caramel and spice at first,  but no real defined finish. <br /><br />Now I know it's pretty much loved the world over so is it possible I sample from a bottle that was left open long or something else sullied what's generally an excellent whiskey?<br /><br />I generally favour pot stills, with Jameson Black Barrel Reserve &amp; Greenspot being two of my fav's right now so its defo not an issue with the type/style of whiskey.</div>

It could also be down to the fact you had your first taste in a pub which I personally believe is not overly condusive to getting to grips with the thraits of a whiskey.<br /><br />3. or simply the price you paid for the whiskey may have led you to expect a fantastic experience and did not get your moneys worth. I personally feel most premium whiskeys are way too expensive in the pubs.<br /><br />Rebreast in my opinion would be a more flavoursome whiskey that green spot.<br /><br />However it really is very much down to personal taste and sometimes certain taste profiles do not suite certain palates.<br /><br />I love Laphroaig but find Ardbeg not to my taste although many belive them to be &quot;slightly&quot; similar styles.<br /><br />Best bet is to try and get a sample and try at home and you'll know for sure whether you like it or not.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Love the Twool. <br /><br />I agree totally with IWC. I'm a big pot still fan and would also go for Redbreast over Green Spot. I'd blame the bottle conditions. <br /><br />Give it another go at home with a nice glass.</div>

				<div class="content">I love Redbreast it's my favourite whiskey - in a blind tasting the 15 yr old was my personal favourite. with the 12 yr old I've noticed variation over the last few years with some years better than others. I wonder was this at play here? totally agree the price in many bars for good whiskey like a redbreast 12 is way over the top.  FX Buckley to their great credit charge less than â‚¬6 for redbreast 12.</div>

				<div class="content">Maybe not the right thread, but....<br />My wife brought me a bottle of cs batch 1/15 from Dublin airport Loop shop, and I wonder if anyone has tried it?<br />It will not be opened for a while yet, so what is the verdict?</div>
