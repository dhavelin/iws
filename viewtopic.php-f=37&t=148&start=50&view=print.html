				<div class="content">Sadly, Motorbikes and Clydesdales may not mix.  Similarly, we may discourage similar raids by barge crews. <br />But it is a good idea and they may like to hold up the Leyland!<br />Pic of &quot;Ned&quot;, the Clydesdale with owners and the Leyland FG (1969) and owners follow:<br /><br /><img src="http://grandcrew.iwai.ie/gallery/thumbs/Jim&amp;SuzieMurrayWithNed.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://grandcrew.iwai.ie/gallery/thumbs/Leyland_FG_1969.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Sorry to be joining this thread late but, as far as I  remember, there was some issue around the label not having been cleared by Industry &amp; Commerce (or whoever) for public sale and that clearing it would have pushed the price up considerably?   Private sale (e.g. by various societies to their members) would be considered a 'private' sale., so wouldn't be affected.  If this is the case, how can anyone get a bottle from Ally?  Did I miss something along the way?<br /><br />Garry. <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /></div>

				<div class="content">Folks,  I've updated the Grand Crew website at <a href="http://grandcrew.iwai.ie" class="postlink">http://grandcrew.iwai.ie</a>.<br />The Gallery includes the first batch of photos from yesterday (no captions yet). See <a href="http://grandcrew.iwai.ie/gallery/" class="postlink">http://grandcrew.iwai.ie/gallery/</a><br /><br />Yesterday was a fantastic example of organisations and individuals cooperating enthusiastically to deliver a fantastic result and very very enjoyable day.  We also had the usual suspects putting in tremendous effort, Offaly IWAI branch, HBA, the 107B project barge crew and the Kilbeggan Harbour Ameniety Group.  The Irish Whiskey Society turned up in numbers to give the casks a good send off.  John Teeling of Cooley was very supportive.  In addition, we had local individuals like Joe Cleary with his vintage Leyland, Jimmy Murray with his Clydesdale, Carina O'Donovan and her riders volunteering tremendous time and effort.  Many thanks to all.<br /><br />A bottle of Grand Crew (or a promise of same) was presented to the 10th annual AXA/AON Annual Across Ireland run (Irelands largest &amp; Longest motorcycle event of its kind) from Dublin to Galway when it passed through Kilbeggan.  The bottle was auctioned for €280 at their charity auction last night.<br /><br />I'd appreciate if people would send me additional photos for use on the Grand Crew site - send to pics[at]iwai.ie<br />Its obvious that we're missing some specific photogenic events, e.g. Brian Quinn sealing the casks, casks being rolled off the cart etc.<br /><br />Michael.</div>
