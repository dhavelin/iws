				<div class="content">Hi there,<br />I have a bottle of this very rare and very fine whiskey, that saddly I have to dispose of. <br /><br />It is in perfect condition and still in its original gift packaging (This means it includes a 10oz Tipperary crystal tumbler). Inside this you will find the original packaging, this was the final run of this before the whiskey was sold in the more familliar wooden boxes.<br /><br />The original owners certificate is included and is as yet un-signed, and as such it is your invitation to the distillery.<br /><br />You can see in the attached pictures the condition of the packing etc.<br /><br />Get in touch if you are interested and we can have a chat. I am based in the midlands and would of course be happy to deliver it or meet you somewhere.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you,<br /><br />Conor.</div>

				<div class="content">Ho Conor,<br /><br />As you say looks like it's in great condition but I can't see the Tipperaray Crystal glass in any of the pictures.<br /><br />IOf you can get one more up with the glass included that would be great.<br /><br />I'm guessing around â‚¬4-500.<br /><br />Goood luck with the sale.</div>

				<div class="content">Add my name to the list of people interested in buying this off you. But just for future reference, the 1986 release was also in this packaging. I'm not entirely sure when the wooden box came in as it's main packaging but The CWS has a 1986 for sale and it's the same packaging as the 85'.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>kurtbenoit wrote:</cite>Do you know if all the early releases also came with the tumbler, I have the 84 but alas no tumbler.</div></blockquote><br /><br />That was obviously a marketing ploy at the time and you'll find that not even all the 1985's came with this but just a batch of them. Lovely addition but I don't think it makes any difference to the value.</div>
