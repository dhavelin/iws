				<div class="content">It just occurred to me. I remember hearing that there was a five year old Bushmills made exclusively for the italian market. (i know more than a few distilleries do this as Italy's grapa background makes clearer spirits sell well). Anyway, i'm in florence right now and i was wondering if this stuff still exists and, if so, if its worth tracking down.</div>

				<div class="content">Not being made any more but the Italians seemed to have a taste for young whiskey as there were various other 5yo on the market, scotch that is. I think Glen Grant had one. I'd say you'd be luck to fine one now and not sure if it is worth going for. Remeber tasting it a long time ago and thought it was fine but nothing to write home about. That is coming from a base that I'm not a major fan of the 10yo either. But I am quite a fan of the Blackbush and 16yo.</div>

				<div class="content">If you see it at a reasonable price there's no harm in getting it at all. We had it at a tasting last year and I think it's quite nice, if not the most complex whiskey you'll ever try. If you like Bushmills it's interesting to try it along with one of the older versions to see how age develops the whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there<br />I've just come back from a holiday in Italy and actually bought a bottle of Bushmills 5 Years Old. Old style bottle in black and gold. Very attractive. Unfortunately it was at the beginning of the holiday and we had very heavy luggage and I was travelling on to Florence after a week so I drank it..! However the bottle was only about 22 euros, so the owner might have a plentiful stock. It was a wine shop in Stresa but had a very good whisk(e)y selection. They also had a bottle of Jameson 1780 12 Years old, which made me wonder whether it was the old one they discontinued, which I absolutely loved. But the bottle looked like a new style and I do get confused with their 12 year old range! Back to the Bushmillls. It was an ok whiskey, predominant flavours of apple and honey. I hoping for a return trip to Stresa next year, and if any bottles still remain I will be buy half a dozen and get them shipped. I took pictures on my phone and if I figure out how to upload them will post them or a link to them. Hope this helps!</div>

				<div class="content">Always great to fine these shops with old stock. Always a bit exciting if not the most amazing whiskey but it's always nice to taste what is now no more.</div>

				<div class="content">Indeed.  Found a 15 y.o. bottle of G&amp;M Benromach in a grocery store in Bowmore distilled before SMD closed it.  I got so excited I forgot the meat I was there to buy!</div>
