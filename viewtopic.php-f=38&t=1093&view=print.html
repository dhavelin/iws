				<div class="content">Hi guys, if you get a link from a facebook friend with &quot;Theme Park accident in Universal Studios Hollywood&quot; or it could be Alton towers beware it is a scam.<br /><br />Basically it looks for you to follow a link and then to view you have to click allow you person facebook data which I never do so I was curious about the link and googled it independently and got loads of hits about it being a phishing scam. Not sure if it is overly malicious as it wants you in the end to do an online survey which the scammers get paid for. Bjut anyway just to be aware.</div>

				<div class="content">There are a whole bunch of scams on Facebook these days. Always of the &quot;Check out this video, it's hilarious / amazing / etc&quot; format. If it's not a link to a video on Facebook itself, or YouTube, then ignore it. Or copy the link, and paste it into another browser where you are not logged into Facebook.</div>

				<div class="content">Personally, I found Facebook to get old very quickly for me. I can't see what could keep people there, except for maybe the games. Most of my friends there post just for the sake of posting. My cousin is one of those people who posts every time he blinks his eyes. Ho hum.</div>

				<div class="content">I always hated those games on FaceBook and being offered various farm animals every time I logged in caused me to ignore it for some time. I've now learned how to get rid of those messages and tend to use it more, it's a good way of interacting with other whisky lovers.</div>

				<div class="content">I used to get clobbered with friends' updates from the games, and lots of offers to join Mafia Wars, Farmville, some game that gave out eggs, etc. They've stopped for some reason. I don't get them anymore. Don't know why.<br /><br />My daughter is logged in all the time, via her phone. I think she's afraid she'll miss something. <br /><br />I communicate with some family members and a few old school friends. And not every day. Better things to do.</div>
