				<div class="content">I wanna just share a great news with you. April/May will be released a third edition of the 15 years old Redbreast. According Irish Distillers the taste of the new version will be near to the first one, which is another great news! It will be released as a <span style="font-weight: bold">single</span> pot still.</div>

Is this not release 4 or 5 ??? I may be wrong but has there been more releases than has been hailed.</div>

				<div class="content">The L code for 2010 could be both 10 or 0. It possibly depends on when and possibly where it was bottled.<br /><br />I may be a scenario that they went with 0 for a while and decided to go with 2 digits there after.<br /><br />Before it was always only 1 digit with o standing for 2000 1 for 2001 2 for 2002 etc. But you also have some of these codes pre-dating that also so you could have say 8 which could stand for 1998 and 2008 . So possibly the 2 digit L code has been brought in to rectify this.</div>
