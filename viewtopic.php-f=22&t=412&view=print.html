				<div class="content">Malt Advocate has announced its <a href="http://www.whatdoesjohnknow.com/2010/02/05/malt-advocate-whisky-awards-irish-whiskey-of-the-year-jameson-rarest-vintage-reserve-2009-release/" class="postlink">Irish whiskey of 2009</a>: Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve (2009 bottling).<br /><br />Has he not tried Grand Crew?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />JohnM gave me a taste of the earlier RVR and I have to say I didn't go for it. I'm sure the next time I try it it will be entirely different so that's only a very preliminary evaluation. But I opened a bottle of Grand Crew Cask 700 (not even the better of the two) last weekend and it was magnificent. Not to mention it is only a sixth of the price of the RVR. So I have to respectfully disagree with this award.</div>

				<div class="content">I think Malt Advocate can only base its awards on what's available on the American market.<br /><br />That said, at $250.00 (c. â‚¬185.00) a bottle I'd be tempted...<br /><br />As I've commented on John Hansell's Blog I'd reckon Redbreast 15, becoming available in the US in October, will most likely take the award next year.<br /><br />It's a shame the better Cooley's (Coolies?), Tyrconnell 17 and the rest, don't get a look in, and as for Bushmills... <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>

				<div class="content">Yes, it's not clear what whiskeys were up for the award. It can only be those that John Hansell tasted (which I'm sure is at least every Irish whiskey that made it to the US) but is it limited to new releases in the US in 2009? If so, that's a small field. A couple of Tullamore Dews, a Knappogue Castle, a few cheap Cooley blends... anything else?<br /><br />I'm sure the details will be in the magazine. I subscribed last December so I hope to get the next issue.</div>

				<div class="content">Really am sad to see that.<br />I'd rather see Jameson utterly lambasted for the RVR than awarded for it.<br />I don't want to see more NAS dubious blends issuing from IDL under 'superduper rare for collectors' type bottlings at preposterous prices, which is basically what RVR is.<br />And when they get awards for something like the RVR that, for me, is a very bad sign as it could only encourage IDL to do more of what I want to see them doing less of.</div>

				<div class="content">I would not be so harsh JC. IDL do a lot of things that irritate but creating a very limited super premium edition is not one of them.<br /><br />They provide a fine range of Whiskies from the NAS up to the 18yo. I think they are entitled to come out with a super premium bottling like a Johnny Walker Blue. I'm not one for age statements as if the whiskey is good it should not matter but I do tend to believe that when they say they use some of their oldest whiskies I believe them. However what we need to remember is you could easily have an amazing 10yo cask mixed in with this just because it is brilliant whiskey. On the flip side is there any point bulking up a whiskey with old but not so good whiskey just to get your age statement. I have a feeling Barry Crocket is very much of the opinion if the whiskey speaks for it's self it should not have to be judged on it's age.<br /><br />Now talk to me about their pricing strategy in Ireland which is punitive and I go  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /></div>

These are all very nice whiskeys.</div></blockquote></div>

I wasn't correcting anyone but just responding to the question mark. <br /><br />From what was available in the U.S., I think JRVR deserves the recognition. Still a bit expensive that side of the pond, but I think it's a great whiskey - very Irish. I'm sure some of those other great irish whiskeys might have won on another day and I'd be just as pleased for them.  <br /><br />While I love pure pot still, I think a good blend can be as good as or better in some instances.</div>
