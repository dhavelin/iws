				<div class="content">I recently picked up another Jameson Rarest.  This bottle does not have a date on it like my 2007.  Internet research shows that 2009 was dated as well.  Well then what year is this one?<br /><br /><a href="http://s16.photobucket.com/user/Birdman1099/media/20150303_143640_zpszxbiqwex.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b2/Birdman1099/20150303_143640_zpszxbiqwex.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://s16.photobucket.com/user/Birdman1099/media/20150303_143703_zpsl4s38mnn.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b2/Birdman1099/20150303_143703_zpsl4s38mnn.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>

				<div class="content">Check the glass carefully for a printed or engraved bottling code (Usually near the base). Should start with L and then the next didgit will be a number and that is usually the year to the decade it was bottled in.<br /><br />The bottling code usually is a 9 digit code and sometimes with a time stamp on the end. <br /><br />i.e L53483071 15:22<br /><br />The particular bottle code above was for a Redbreast 15yo and was a 2005 bottle, bottled on 348th day of that year in bottling plant 307 on line 1 at 15:22pm<br /><br />Given that the 2007 version was the first of the species if it is <span style="font-weight: bold">L9*******</span> I'm guessing 2009<span style="font-weight: bold"> L0*******</span> 2010<span style="font-weight: bold"> L1*******</span> 2011 and so on.<br /><br />Let us know what you see.</div>

				<div class="content">Interesting ... and good to know. I'd be going with 2014 too.<br /><br />My open 2007 is L727531088 12:45 so looks like it was bottled the following day to yours.</div>

They usually do up a batch that they are happy with and if it is a generous batch they may only bottle a certain percentage. The rest would be held in a vat which more than lightly would be stainless steel. So even though yours was bottled in 2008 it would still be considered 2007 vintage as it was out of cask in 2007. The industry sometimes does this with very only vintage whisky where the wood is starting to over egg the whiskey. So it is kept safe unaltered in a vat until they know when they need it.</div>
