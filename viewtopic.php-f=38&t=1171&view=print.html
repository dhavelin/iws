				<div class="content">I'm not a Cigar aficionado so could not recommend actual cigars to go with what ever whiskey<br /><br />But the Blackbush is a good one to go with cigars in general. Basically some of the heavier and sweeter whiskeys go well with cigars.<br /><br />Bourbon is also good with a cigar.<br /><br />I would imagine lighter cigars would go better with the likes of Jameson and the Michael Collins.</div>

Maybe one for summer.<br /><br />There's always that Dalmore Cigar malt by the way, which was supposedly designed to drink with a cigar. Which I suppose is no help really seeing as it was Cigars asked for rather than whiskeys. Sorry.</div>

				<div class="content">A few suggestions for cigars and whiskey.<br />There is an interesting tubed cigar called Vasco de Gama whiskey cigar which is aged with Glenfarclas single malt.<br />That could kill two birds with the one stone, don't you think? I prefer a Partagas number 4 with a whiskey. It;s strong so you need a good drop to cope with it. The Grafton Corona is also a good everyday match for whiskey. <br />This one is available in The Decent Cigar Company Dublin or ourselves here in The Wine Centre Kilkenny. Better still, drop in to us and taste some Irish whiskey and stick you head in our humidor while your are at it. <br />Regards to all , Liam Murray.</div>

I prefer dominican origin cigars: Arturo Fuente or CAO cigars  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">OK, I chose to keep posting on an old thread rather than starting a new one. Had a group over for dinner. Afterwards, cracked open the Tyrconnell 16 year old with some H Upmann Media Coronas from Cuba. It was a big hit! I would love to hear about your Irish-Cuban success stories.</div>

				<div class="content">I generally smoke a pipe, but occasionally I indulge in a nice Havana.<br />My favourites are Montecristo no. 2, Partagas Series P no. 2 and Partagas Series D no 4.<br />They are all rather powerful cigars, but have lovely flavours.<br />Of the Irish whiskeys that have paired well are all Redbreasts and Powers. Maybe it is the potstill that is big enough to complement the cigars.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the tip on the Redbreast, I have some Montecristo Corona's and Cohiba Siglo II's which I might try with the Redbreast Cask Strength  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Also have a few small Fonsecas but not the best always found them to tight but maybe that's because I'm not a regular smoker.</div>
