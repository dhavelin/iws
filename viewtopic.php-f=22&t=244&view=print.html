Don't think anybody would be lucky enough to get anything pre Queen Victoria.<br /><br />Victoria 	(1837-1901)<br />Edward VII 	(1901-10)<br />George V 	(1910-36)<br />Edward VIII 	(1936) the King that never became King<br />George VI 	(1936-52)<br />Elizabeth II 	(1952-present)<br /><br /><br /><br />Some Bottles of Irish have been labeled with the &quot;Irish Free state&quot;  1922 - 1937<br /><br /><br /><br />US bottles.<br /><br />In the US <span style="font-weight: bold">Tariff Act of 1930</span> it stipulates that a country of origin mark has to be placed on all imports. The Country of origin mark has to be in English and in the form of “Made In ********” where ******* is the country’s name.<br /><br />I would like clarification on the date of the Act and whether there was anything prior? But could be very useful in identifying pre &amp; post prohibition bottle of Whiskey as the act was passed during prohibition (1920-1933).</div>

The receipt dates would help in determining what bottles were on the market at any given date I would imagine?<br /><br />J.</div>
