				<div class="content">its strange that you mention 2006-- The first really incredible whisky i ever had was a Lagavulin 16 around 2006-07, i remember taking it home, opening the bottle and smelling islay peat reek for the very first time, only later learning that that distinct odor was a lagavulin-specific concoction of a pungent oloroso backdrop to a steller peat mixture etc. it fumigated the whole room and i was basically inhaling the stuff for days to come (keep in mind i was 19) I've since gone back to Lagavulin many times but its never been quite the same and i always imagined it was just the sheer shock of the first encounter...</div>

I think batches are issued annually, with mine being bottled in June, 2011.  It is fairly well regarded and is most comparable (generally) to an Islay style whisky.  First impression...nice flavour profile, though the overall feel seems thin/diluted.<br /><br />Parkers Heritage Collection 5th is basically Evan Williams Single Barrel (aged roughly 10 years) that has been finished for four months in cognac casks.  I have not opened it to try it yet.  Bourbon purists may not like the 'finishing' concept, but most reviews are very positive.  The PHC line (a different whiskey issued annually by Heaven Hill) is right up there with the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (Stagg, Weller, Handy, Eagle Rare 17, and Sazerac) in terms of consistent high quality.<br /><br />Rowan's Creek is a small batch bourbon that I purchased solely on strong reviews.  It is associated with other craft bourbons (Noah's Mill, and a couple of others are in the same grouping, from an ownership standpoint).<br /><br /><br />I am interested to hear peoples thoughts on the Yellow Spot.  The LCBO (the government monopoly liquor stores in Ontario) just brought in Green Spot (I think it has been here before, but not in a while) at the beginning of 2012.  I enjoyed it at a tasting in March, but I think (especially for almost 1/2 the price) I prefer the Redbreast 12...the 'bolder' profile of the R12 has a stronger appeal to my palate.</div>

If I had to guess (and only a guess), if the $85 works for Green Spot, Yellow Spot will probably come in between Can$115 - $135 (Glenfarclas 21 is at $122, to keep a consistent reference point).  I'll keep people posted.  I would love to try Yellow Spot, if it makes it over here.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think the McCarthy's is very like the single malt made at Kilbeggan.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I just wanted to clear this up before people are confused.  <br /><br />John McCarthy has a very nice distillery in Portland Oregon called Clear Creek (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.clearcreekdistillery.com">http://www.clearcreekdistillery.com</a><!-- m -->).  His family own a fruit orchard and what he would primarily make is Eau-de-Vie from the fruit.  He also makes a Peated Single Malt Whiskey from Scottish peated malt. The single malt is distilled on the same stills as the Eau-de_vie and the wash is made by a local brewery.  I like his whiskey. When I was a young man living in Portland and interested in distilling John was very good to me and my questions.<br /><br />The malt whiskey made in Kilbeggan is non-peated and double distilled in pot still from wash made onsite.  <br /><br />I would not say that one whiskey is better than the other but they are not the same.  Chalk and Cheese in the whiskey world.</div>
