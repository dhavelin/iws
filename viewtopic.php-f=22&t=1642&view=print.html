For reference, Highland Park 18 is $140, Laphroaig 18 is $180, and Jameson's 18 is $110.)<br /><br />I have quickly come to the conclusion that Macallan is the Sony or Honda of the whisky world...you are paying a massive premium for the perceived quality inherent in the name brand, but the quality that is there (and some is there), is not worth the premium paid.</div>
