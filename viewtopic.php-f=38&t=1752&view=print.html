				<div class="content">I had assumed Smithwick's was still made in Kilkenny, but I this link says it's made in Dundalk (in the Great Northern Brewery): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brewery+is+back+on+tap...-a091899838">http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brewery+i ... a091899838</a><!-- m --><br /><br />However, I understand the new Smithwick's Pale Ale is brewed in Dublin.  <br /><br />Macardle's was brewed in the old Macardle's brewery in Dundalk, which is now closed, the article at the link says it's made in the Great Northern now.  I think the old Smithwick's Barley Wine (which I rather liked) was also made in Macardle's.</div>
