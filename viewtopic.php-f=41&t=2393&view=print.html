And as they were a wine merchants would lead me to believe that they bottle one of the local Dublin Whiskey's at the time. Dating the bottle would be interesting and unless we can figure that out it will be nigh impossible and even if we can it will be very hard to figure out what distillery it came from.<br /><br />Sounds very interesting though.</div>

				<div class="content">Uisce beatha may be interested to know that the owner of Fitzgerald &amp; Co Ltd was a prominent Dublin businessman and politician named Martin Fitzgerald who was born in my home town of Charlestown, Co. Mayo in 1867. He was the last owner of The Freeman's Journal which he purchased in 1919 and which became the unofficial organ of the Irish Free State government. The paper was subsumed into the Irish Independent in 1925.  Fitzgerald was appointed as an independent Senator in the inaugural Seanad Eireann from 1922-1927, the year he died. He was also a well-know racehorse owner.</div>
