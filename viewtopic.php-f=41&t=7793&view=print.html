				<div class="content">While sorting through old family photos, we came upon this whiskey label from a now deceased family member's bar in Monaghan. Can anyone tell me more about it? I've had no luck searching on Google:  Finest Old Irish Pot Still Whiskey B MacMahon, The Park Bar, Market Street, Monaghan. <br />B. MacMahon was Bennie MacMahon.<br />Thank you, Carole</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Carole,<br /><br />It's an independent bottling label. Before Irish Distillers formed in the 60's, there were many independent bottlers. They simply bought the spirit in bulk, often by cask &amp; bottles it themselves. This was probably a Jameson although it doesn't say on the label. The font &amp; design looks like an old Jameson label anyway.</div>

				<div class="content">Very interesting! Thank you for the explanation. Unfortunately the labels were in a stack and not attached to full bottles. <br />Happy New Year</div>
