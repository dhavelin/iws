				<div class="content">Is this really nineteen years old ? It seem simple maths have been put on to this distilled in 1991 its now 2011, so it must be 19/20 years olds??? Not necessarily, i remember some of the CWS bottles were  bottled in 2003/4 but didnt go on sale until much later, Diageo &quot;found&quot; more stock last year, yet neither bottlings have mentioned year of bottling.</div>

				<div class="content">I think in fact some of the CWS Rum cask was 17years old.<br /><br />The 17years thing came from a mix up in the batch they got. They were expecting all their 2006 release to be distilled in 1993 and to be between 13 &amp; 14 years as agreed with Bushmills but some of the rum (if not all) was from 1989, whether or not it was bottled in 2006 is another thing. This type of Label popped up in 2004 and was available mainly in travel retail an was all from 1989 and bottled in 2004 and was pretty much all 14year old stuff. Ally thought it was 17yo at the time though. I don't have any left so if any one has a bottle they might check the L code on the bottle to let us know for sure.</div>
