I think a new owner will bring new ideas and hopefully Colum Egan will get freedom to develope new whiskeys. Remember all fantastic whiskeys they had around the millennium. That double distilled stuff that Tellings have is excellent too.</div>

				<div class="content">I read an article saying they had reduced their market percentage in Ireland Whiskey in the last few years. It was 17% of the Irish whiskey market in 2008 and in 2013 it was 8%. That is a big drop. I wonder does any of their staff now work for Irish Water?</div>

				<div class="content">This might sound mad but I'm starting to wonder if I would like to see Bushmills going back to IDL. I've just been looking at some of the single cask bottlings and the old 12 yr old select casks release that all date from those days - all great whiskeys and at that time there was very little unusual coming from Midleton. When you look at what Midleton have done since you'd have to wonder would an IDL reacquisirion be so bad. I was excited when diageo took over as there was so little competition at the time but there's a lot more out there now. Just a thought.</div>

I know little about Jose Cuervo so I'm not going to judge them yet. Fingers crossed all the same.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm with the general opinion on this and think that at least the move away from Diageo has to be good for Bushmills. They certainly didn't do an awful lot to promote their releases here.</div>
