				<div class="content">Nice job on the Powers.  Would love to try it someday.<br /><br />There's always seems to be one or two bottles in each auction that seem to go wild on price.  That crested ten was double the price of the last one on the site.  You would have thought half that price, no?</div>

They don't allow alcohol sales in Ireland and the UK. They fear that kids will be able to buy it. Can you imagine a kid spending €1010 on a bottle of whiskey?</div>

				<div class="content">Scottish Whisky auctions finished today.<br /><br />Old Irish Gold 15 year old got £280<br />This is their description ''A German bottling of old Dublin whiskey.

I rarely get any because if you factor in the commission and exchange rate things can get very dear.<br />But if you got to have that bottle you got to have it.  An example was a <span style="font-weight: bold">Jameson 15 PPS</span> got <span style="font-weight: bold">£420</span> a couple of months ago.</div>
