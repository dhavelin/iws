				<div class="content">I usually keep the blends for the pub ...<br /><br />Obviously Powers is top of the list with Guinness.<br /><br />Others I've regularly have are Johnny Walker Black label and Teachers if looking for something different, however as scotch blends are usually far and between in pubs I really don't nkow much else. Do'n't really like JW REd or Black and White</div>

				<div class="content">I'm really a bit of a malt head. But the best well priced ( everyday ) ones i tried in recent times have to be Té Bheag, Black Bottle and Bailie Nicol Jarvie. <br /> <br />Sulphur can be a problem with blends, the levels are never high but it's frustrating anyhow. These three are ok for now, considering a lot of Bunna goes into the Black Bottle i don't know how long that will last though.</div>

People rave about Black bottle but I just can't see what it's all about  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Some how I find alot of scotch bog standard blends lack richness and complexity (from my point of view) in comparison to Irish bog standard blends.<br /><br />Maybe I should revisit them.</div>
