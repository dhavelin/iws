				<div class="content">The Scotsman has <a href="http://business.scotsman.com/business/Whisky-firm-Grant-plans-Irish.6267052.jp" class="postlink">big news today</a>. They say that William Grant, who just bought Tullamore Dew, plans to build a distillery here to make it.<br /><br />Wow!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">That would be excellent. <br /><br />The more Irish whiskey on the shelf, the more will be bought, I believe. Would force others to up their game even further.</div>

				<div class="content">Any word on what they plan to make at this new distillery? Will it just continue to be a pps/grain blend along similar lines to the current product? will it become a malt/grain blend? a single malt? or maybe even (gasp) a pps whiskey like the original stuff from Daly's of Tullamore? Any combination of the above?</div>

				<div class="content">Afaik, the deal doesn't go through until C+C shareholders approve it which won't be till June.<br />So there won't be many details emerging until after that, I guess.<br />But no harm in calling them to ask, I suppose. I'll give Grant a bell.</div>

				<div class="content">The biggest surprise for me in that article was that Tullamore Dew outsells Bushmills - which I presume takes third place in worlwide sales?<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">I was also surprised by that John. Although, here in the states at least, Tullamore Dew have crafted a niche among college kids and other cheap-end buyers looking to buy Irish whiskey because they're fractionally cheaper than either Jameson or Bushmills White.</div>

				<div class="content">Grant not that keen to talk about their plans at the moment. They want to wait a few weeks before making any announcement.<br />But unofficially, I'm led to believe the purchase of the brand is only the beginning of what they hope to do.</div>

				<div class="content">This could be great news and really shake up the market.  However I must say I;m very surprised at C&amp;C off-loading the most profitable part of their business.  But as we know different logic operates in the higher ends of business. <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /></div>

				<div class="content">You might not be too far off the mark with 10 years Zoltan; depending on the amount of development that they have to complete beforehand.<br />So we'll have Cork whiskey, Kerry whiskey and Tipperary whiskey? These Munstermen are trying to steal a march I reckon?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />J.</div>
