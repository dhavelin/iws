				<div class="content">Hi woodslb,<br /><br />Can you post a picture please. <br /><br />Is it a bulbous bottle with a blue label??? <br /><br />Quinn group released a few bottles for staff and depending on the contents could be worth a few quid or not. Hope I'm not getting it mixed up with another though? Glen Dimplex springs to mind too.<br /><br />Basically need to see the bottle and also if you know what distillery it came from. See if anything is printed on the back label if theer is one.<br /><br />Cheers</div>

				<div class="content">Here we are ...<br /><br />Still unsure of the contents and there does not seem to be any rear label. Is there any indication on/in the box where the whiskey came from?<br /><br />I would suspect it is a cooley Malt but cannot rule out Bushmills? <br /><br />As it stands I suggest it would at least be worth 80-100Euro of anyones money as a curio but if we cannot not varify contents we can't place a better value on it.<br /><br />Anybody else have any ideas?<br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Independent%20Bottlers/Quinn2000_zps108a17c8.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="http://s155.photobucket.com/user/irishwhiskeychaser/media/Independent%20Bottlers/114e24ff-8c1c-46fb-a995-83ea751518f9_zpsf07a11b5.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Independent%20Bottlers/114e24ff-8c1c-46fb-a995-83ea751518f9_zpsf07a11b5.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>

				<div class="content">Sorry for late reply, thank for putting the pics up. And no there is no back label and no leaflet in the case unfortunately! Any ideas who would even know anything about this bottle? When i googled it I seen one had been advertised years ago and sold for round 200 euro, cant find source of that email now, thought perhaps would have increased in price now lol!</div>

Any strange Irish a few years ago got silly money.<br />However since the recession people have got very selective on what they buy.<br />Therefore as a collectable with out being able to identify the contents I don't think it holds any great value, but that's just my personal view.<br /><br />However if you contact the Celtic Whiskey Shop they might offer a decent amount especially if they have someone on their books specifically looking for something like this.</div>
