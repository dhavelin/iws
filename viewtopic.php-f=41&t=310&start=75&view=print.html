				<div class="content">There were some astonishing results in January's Whiskyauctions.com<br />Apart from that Kilbeggan making €1122 a new whiskyauction for world whiskey.Congratulations to the buyer and seller.<br />Hopefully it'll drag a few more out of hiding!!<br />The one that caugh my attention were The John's lane made €68, it had a very high fill level for its age too but condition was good. <br />There were 2 Smithfield bottles, €32 for one &amp; €53 for the one with a box,again they were in good condition.<br />I checked previous results and back in 2008 they were making €15 for the John's Lane (condition not good) and €18 for a Smithfield bottle. <br />Paddy bottles made good prices too, €47 for the whisky and €32 for the whiskey.<br />Then there were 3 Jameson 12 Years Old Distiller's Selection which went for €35,€35,and €39. I bid on them early but never though i end up with one for €35. Great value even with postage if you got a few other things with it.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes a serious price but this is seriously rare so will be interesting to see if it makes the estimate or even exceeds it.

I have worked out that between Ebay fees and Paypal fees you pay between 13-15% on your end price so a better deal for us as Postage to Germany I think would not make it worth while. However if I had access to a commercial Courier rate and shipped in bulk that would be different. I would imagine that the Majority of bottles are from main land Europe where sending bulk items is much lower in comparison to the UK &amp; especially Ireland. However they do seem to command very good prices and I think if one can get onesbottles to WhiskyAuction cheaply it would pay one to do so. Irish Whiskey prices on WhiskyAuction seem to be the highest around which would suggest they have a very good following. Back in the early days you could get some great bargains but not so much so any more.</div>

				<div class="content">whiskyauction is very expensive to sell on, with charges of around 20%, as mentioned. Now scotchwhiskyauctions.com is effectively charging about the same amount... adding 10% of the hammer price on for the buyer and taking 10% plus a fee from the seller. I hope I'm not misrepresenting them, so correct me if I'm wrong. <br /><br />McTears is about 15%, isn't it? whiskyauction.com gets quite high prices, of course. <br /><br />One of the Tullamore miniatures from Cadenhead went on eBay just very recently for about £65...

WhiskyAuction only charges the seller at a higher rate which is not much good to you if your selling but great for the seller.<br /><br />Also with regular Auction houses you have to pay vat on the commission. Not sure about here in Ireland but certainly in the UK. <br /><br />For instance if you buy something for £100 you are charged £15 commission and then Vat on the £15 quid which is 20% in the UK so another £3 <br /><br />So a total of £118.</div>

Not planning on selling anything but have occasionally bought stuff there - just wondering if the sellers know who they're selling to.<br /><br />The prices certainly have gone up there over the last while - I'd say it's probably at least partially down to the members of this forum becoming more aware of the site and possibly even creating our own mini bubble. There's been a few discussions here and moreso elsewhere recently about the value of whiskeys as investments. One example is the sort of mad figures being thrown around for a complete set of Midletons. I'm just not that sure that big increases can be counted on when there's a relatively small pool interested in old and rare Irish whiskeys. I know some people have talked about certain whiskeys going up by 10, 20% etc. in the last year. But you could also note that Diageo and Pernod Ricard shares have gone up by 20% and 15% in the last 6 months. We all know that doesn't mean it stays that way. (I personally like the idea of buying these shares as I feel whenever I buy a Bushmills, Midleton, Guinness, Lagavulin, etc etc. that somewhere along the way I'd be getting a tiny bit of the money back!)<br /><br />I think the Irish whiskey values sometimes remind me of the mad growth in the prices of &quot;trophy&quot; homes in dublin in the early 2000s. There was a small group all bidding against each other which sent the prices mad. (And I mean on a far bigger scale that the already mad bubble in general house prices). Once the tap was turned off these prices collapsed completely, far worse than the national average. Personally I think 2 or 3 people eager to buy would be all it would take to creat a mini bubble in the Irish whiskeys on Whiskyauction. I'm probably one of them.<br /><br />I'm not really making a point about anything here, just some idle musings.</div>

Very disturbing. I've been lucky with any auction purchases so far. The only issue i ever had was resolved quickly and favourably.<br /><br />I would always ask for a condition report if i see clingwrap on one too. I bough an expensive bottling a number of years age online for a reputable whisky shop and the box was in a very poor state. It cost me to got it repaired then.
