Many of us will of course know you already from the great work you've been doing at Bladnoch.<br />In response to your interesting statement about how Scotch has its proselytisers in a way Irish whiskey doesn't, I have a personal take on that which is a teeny bit confrontational.<br />In the late Nineteenth century, the Scots adulterated our whiskey because it was better. They passed their own off as Irish because our whiskey was better. They savaged our industry and tarriffed it out of business because our whiskey was better, and they bought up and shut many distilleries in Ulster because our whiskey was better.<br />The Scotch industry's products I like a lot. Their history I despise.<br />They stole our thunder, and one thing I hope the Irish Whiskey Society can do is help steal it back. Because do you know something? Our whiskey is STILL better.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I hope the Irish Whiskey Society can steal it back also, after all wasnt it a Scotsman who got it up and running  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">Can't really blame the scotts for the demise of the Irish Whiskey industry ... Of course there was a lot of world events that went against the Irish industry but the scotts had a lot of the same issues to deal against with the exception of the Brittish Empire but we also have to accept that alot of the Irish did not addapt when the writing was on the wall ... rember it was not til the 60's that the blend became the main stay and saviour of Irish Whiskey ... about 60 years too late. The Irish may have been admirable with their intent but foolish not to recgonise the issues of modern life. But I suppose hind sight is a wonderful thing.</div>

				<div class="content">Kaixo Guys,<br />Right on the nail their Adrian, no point crying over spilled malt, no point blaming anyone as we ourselves had a lot of bad management in the Industry over the years.When i got my &quot;Great Whisk(e)y bar of the world&quot; award by those nice cheaps at Whiskymag, which was a surprise as i dont sell Scotch (as unique selling point for my bizz,but i love some Scotch whiskys)the answer i got was i am doing a great job for the whisk(e)y industry in general and as two of our Irish are owned by the same corporates who own most of the Scotch distilleries, were all in bed together...<br /><br />I dont think i have to b**** any competitors to sell Irish whiskey,as i think the products stand for themselves,and i feel a certain affinity with other whisky buffs just like Scrumbags or Ruggerbuggers in Rugby, who have a common interest /passion.<br />Just like Irish Rugby i love to see Irish excellence up against the best in the world,and become serious players/contenders in the Great game..But if we want others to take our whiskey seriously then we the Irish nation need to start sipping more,just think how much the Scotch whisky industry makes for the British exchequer ???<br /><br />We also need to reclaim cultural teritory  as well such as the Kilt (tartan invented by Irish king Tigernmas 6th century) and even though the bagpipes are not Celtic but Greek, the first time the Scots saw the effect of the pipes in battle was at Falkirk with the Irish Clanns.<br />ps; the infamous alledged book of clan tartan was a fake scam by the Sobiesky stewart brothers,their was no defined clan patterns but a more adhoc random system!!<br />And at their famous last battle at Culldoden 1746 the Highlanders fled routed as the Irish clanns and Irish French regiments held the line and were the last men standing!!!!!!indeed Bonnie Prince Charlie insisted on an Irish Escort/bodygards,Capt OÂ´Shea of Fitzjames horse!!Slainte !!!!!!!!!!!</div>
