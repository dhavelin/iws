I know adverts don't allow you to sell alcohol otherwise, although some do sneak by. <br /><br />That's a crazy price for the Jameson. I know I drank my ones. Probably should have kept one. <br /><br />You know the saying 'fools and their money.....' , well how did they ever get the money in the first place?</div>

				<div class="content">Scotch Whisky Auction had a Jameson 12, brown label from 70's, in their last auction. It got £145. A good price from this auction. They have an app too. <br />My only complaint is they don't break the whisk(e)y into different categories. Using the app can be painful when there are 1500 + lots. <br /><br />I have only go a couple of things since they started. They have little Irish or American as you can imagine. The charges and postage are steep if your in Ireland. That Jameson would cost roughly £185/€220+. <br /><br />It's still good to see more places out there.</div>
