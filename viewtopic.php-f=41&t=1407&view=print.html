				<div class="content">A partial collection was sold in December 2011 covering vintages from 1984-2003 for €8,000, then add an average €150 each for 2004-2011 and that brings it to €9,200.<br /><br />That sets a floor of about €10,000 for a complete collection.<br /><br />The DAA have/had a complete collection as new for €24,000 in 2011.<br /><br />My personal view is €12,000 would be a good return on a complete collection,<br /><br />Again finding a buyer with deep pockets is your challenge,<br /><br />Worth discussing with the CelticWhiskeyShop and/or Adams Auctioneers here in Ireland before you proceed.<br /><br />Views from anyone else?</div>

				<div class="content">I think there's nearly a constant presence on this forum of different people looking for different years from the Midleton collection, if he wasn't in a rush to sell I think he could sell them individually over 6 months. Perhaps he could do a guarantee, first person to ask for a particular year, he keeps it for them, doesn't sell just yet, but guarantees it's their's. When he has enough guarantees to make selling worth his while, he can sell to the people he guaranteed them to. I've bought and sold to people on this forum where the bottles were kept for around 4 months so to avoid postage charges and traded when it was possible to meet face to face.</div>

				<div class="content">The most I've seen paid for a full collection was €10k. That was a number of years ago when times were better. You could probably assemble a collection yourself for about €3,000, although it would take a long time - there are more and more individual bottles for sale at auctions these days. I think €8,000 to €12,000 would be a fair price...</div>

It would work out much less than selling as an entire collection. Although it might be harder to sell as an entire collection.</div>

				<div class="content">My view would be to contact Ally in the Celtic Whiskey Shop and make him aware of your collection and if he comes across anybody he might be able to assist you but as said by others it could take a while to find a buyer in this climate.</div>
