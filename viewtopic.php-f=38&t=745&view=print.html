Drums, songs, chants, songs all gravy, but this stuff puts some of the worst experimental noise music designed to alienate listeners into the shade.  It has totally killed my enjoyment and I can't watch the matches.</div>

				<div class="content">I know what you mean Cathach, if there was even some form of melody from them you could put up with it, but that singular drone just gets annoying after a while. The World Cup organising committee in South Aftrica have thrown their weight behind them because of the tradition of using them at soccer matches in Africa and to quote their spokesman 'you either love them or hate them'.</div>

I've watched most of the matches and the comentary comes across loud and clear and the hornets nest just does not bother me. RTE had a shed load of callers complaining about the noise too. I think virtually every broadcaster has had complaints.<br />All a lot of hot air if you ask me  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

A South African colleague has informed me that, from the historical perspective, they were used by the Impi (?) who were Zulu warriors before going into battle. A kind of droning war-cry if you will. Probably lulled the enemy into a false sense of security by making them think there was only a soccer match nearby..... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">Brazil ohhh Brazil ... some wonderful play allright but not exactly setting the World cup on fire and in the end the North Koreans came out best from the game, what a wonderful effort and heart fair play. Totally out classsed yet they still held Brazil to a 2-1 defeat which has to be considered a major result from them  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />That first goal was a total fluke too ... I'm convinced ... and just because it was a brazilian loads of people are saying brilliant  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />I think they will be my under dog to follow for the remainder of the qualifier round ... anybody know where I can get a Korea DPR shirt  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">It looks like 'Earl' was right: 'Do bad things and bad things happen'!! An iffy offside first goal and a second one conceeded by way of a penalty, compounded by failing to score any goals themselves in either game. South Africa will be playing for pride in France's final game so they won't have it easy there either. Bit of a nightmare tournament for France all in all.</div>
