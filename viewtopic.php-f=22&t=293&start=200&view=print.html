				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   Money  is VERY tight!  So, all I bought was one bottle of (on sale in NH) JAMESON 12 ($30.99 no tax) and a bottle of POWER GOLD LABEL (on sale $18.49 no tax).  I wish REDBREAST or THE IRISHMAN were on sale again.  I now have eleven UNopened bottles and about six or seven open bottles.  About three or four empties.<br /><br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">^^ I heartily agree, especially after trying it on Friday night.  My &quot;usual&quot; is Powers Gold Label so I enjoyed the 12yr appellation very much.  Too bad I can't find it in-store, it appears my only option is to mail order thru the state-owned stores.<br /><br />brettie, I hear ya on Jameson 12 yr and Tully 12.  I am having trouble finding Tullamore Dew 12yr in state stores here but they have the 10yr on the shelves most of the time.</div>

				<div class="content">I recently tried my first glass of Maker's Mark and fell in love. It's not my favorite whiskey, by any means; however, it's enough to make me go out and purchase the stuff. It's very bold yet very smooth and I enjoy it over a few ice cubes while I'm eating a nice steak dinner. Many of my friends aren't crazy about the taste of Maker's Mark, but I enjoy it. . . although it's obviously not Jameson (my favorite whiskey).</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>IrishWhiskeyChaser wrote:</cite>Nice haul JC ... The Yamazaki sounds very nice ...<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />I think you'd love it, actually. And it's an exceptionally good value dram for the price.<br />I found the 10 yo Yamazaki to be very estery for my palate, full of green apple flavours. But this is a heavily sherried job - spicey, winey and sumptuous. It's reminiscent of the Aberlour A'Bunadh in its sherry character but goes a half-step further along that road, producing an almost cognac-y tannin quality on the finish.<br />At the price point in Dublin, it is very good value indeed, especially for a Japanese dram which tend, due to production costs and import costs, to be prohibitively pricey.</div>
