				<div class="content">Was in Glesgae the weekend before last. No check in bag, so no bottles on the plane. Had to mail them back and they arrived on Monday.<br />A 36 year old Dallas Dhu distilled in 1971, a 'Cask of Yamazaki' heavily peated malt which I tried and really liked at Whisky Live last year, and an Octomore 2, which, if it is as smokey as is claimed, I will pipette judiciously into cheap supermarket blends in order to keep my phenol-favouring other half away from the Lagavulins, Bowmores and Caol  Islas.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi John,<br /><br />I know it's a very good price and surely I don't mind you asking, I bought them from 2 different liquor stores in my hometown, Athens. There are some merchants-liquor stores down here that do not know what is going on with certain whisky bottles and their price level globally, especially older ones that are upon the shop selves for years. So, there is a big possibility for people who know, to get really lucky.<br /><br />I tell you this. Last summer I went to Chios Island (northeast Greece) for a friend's marriage and stayed for 10 days holiday. As I walked through a central street I saw a nice liquor store with a good whisky collection and went in. After 10 minutes I walked out, with a Jameson 15yo pure pot still (35euros)  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> and an old collectible (early '90s) Glen Rothes 12y.o. (25euros)  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
