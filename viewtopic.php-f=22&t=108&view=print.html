I think I read somewhere that by the time some of the last of these old Redbreasts were bottled they were in cask a lot longer that 12 years and some of them were past their best. The old label dates from when the brand was owned by Gilbeys and they were bottling old stock long after Jameson and later Midleton had stopped supplying them with casks. In fact, I'm not sure if any of there stock ever came from Midleton or if it's all old Jameson stuff from Dublin. It was bottled as a 12yo in the 80's but was probably older. Jameson ceased production and moved to Midleton in the 70's, as far as I know.<br /><br />John M will know! Are you out there John??</div>

Considering that the bould Mr Murray - the other one - not me, states that this will be discontinued I think that  Euro43.99 is a good price. There is a case or so left on the shelf.

				<div class="content">Hi all I was reading some of your posts about a 10 year old redbreast whiskey from Gilbeys. I have a 12 year old redbreast whiskey from Gilbeys and wondered if it would creat much interest, the lable is damaged but it can be clearly read as &quot;Redbreast Rare Old Irish Whiskey&quot; and there is a screw cap and not a cork but it is still sealed. I look forward to hearing from you, Connell.</div>
