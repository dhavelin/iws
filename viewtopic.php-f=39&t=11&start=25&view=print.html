				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />Really glad to have discovered this site; I'm on the mailing list for the society but i'm rarely in Ireland when the tastings seem to be occurring. Family's from Clontarf originally but we moved out to Los Angeles when my dad got work here and i'm currently finishing up my undergraduate studies at Berkeley here in the states. Anyway, i've always been a big malt and pure pot still fan and i've also got quite an interest in whiskey history. My favorite drams are Redbreast (both the 12 and the 15 yr Old), Lagavulin 16 yr old, Ardbeg Uigeadail, and Green Spot. As you can probably guess from that list, i have a particular fondness for both peaty and pot still whiskeys. <br />Anyway, we have a kind of quirky program here at Berkeley called the &quot;decal&quot; system through which students (under the supervision of a sponsoring professor who pops in now and again) teach our own classes on offbeat subjects for fun and my friend David and i happen to run a class on the history and appreciation of Whiskey so i'm very glad to have the opportunity to get some input and help from you guys.<br /><br />-Fionnán</div>
