				<div class="content">Hi John<br /><br />Secrets out, we will be tasting them side by side on the 2nd Oct. You will notice the difference. Will be explained on the night.<br /><br />David has a write up on the new bottling on his liquid irish blog or visit <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.tullamoredew.com/our-new-distillery">http://www.tullamoredew.com/our-new-distillery</a><!-- m --> for some info. on it.<br /><br />There will also be a whiskey only available  in Tullamore, one that is not available in the Irish market, an award winning 12 year old and of course there is no secret on the last one - you can`t have a Tullamore D.E.W. tasting without the Tullamore D.E.W. original. So 6 in total<br /><br />Can you guess them?? I bet you can`t get them all <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />A welcome cocktail will be provided.<br /><br />There will be a Tullamore D.E.W. gift for all that attend.<br /><br />Thats the lineup and you already know that Tim will talk about whiskey in the U.S.A. and Jane will talk about the new distillery.<br /><br />I think thats great value at the discounted price - €15 to €10 for members and €25 to €15 for non members.<br /><br />Hope you can all attend</div>

				<div class="content">First of all thank you to everyone that attended. Hope you had a great night. <br /><br />The full range tasted, together with some notes is now on the website. (see the events section)<br /><br />Whiskies were Tullamore D.E.W. original, Tullamore D.E.W. 12 year old reserve, Tullamore D.E.W. old bonded warehouse, Tullamore D.E.W. 14 year old Single Malt, Tullamore D.E.W. Phoenix and Tullamore D.E.W. Phoenix Celebratory. Excellent whiskies enjoyed by all. If you are interested the cocktail was Apple D.E.W. and the gift was a Tullamore D.E.W. flat cap or a Tullamore D.E.W. hip flask.<br /><br />Due to unforseen circumstances, John Quinn took the place of the 2 ambassadors advertised. Most of you already know John, he is the global brand ambassador with Tullamore D.E.W. He has been with the company for many years and has a huge amount of knowledge and experience.  It was great to have him host. <br /><br />He shared slides of the new distillery in the various construction stages and on the opening day. He answered everyones  questions. <br /><br />At the moment the main goal is to produce exactly the same product that exists. It is a difficult task, but we are told it can be done. They will produce malt and pot still at the new distillery, with plans for grain whiskey in further expansion.<br /><br />The Phoenix and Phoenix Celebratory were voted joint first on the night. Both have high potstill content and were 55% abv.They are limited releases. As production ramps up and Tullamore D.E.W. have control over the production, we hope to see an increase in the offerings available from them.<br /><br />The future looks great for the brand and we wish them every success.<br /><br />You can see two excellent blogs at liquid irish - <a href="http://www.liquidirish.com/2014/09/tullamore-dew-phoenix-celebratory.html" class="postlink">one about the Phoenix Celeb. bottling</a> and <a href="http://www.liquidirish.com/2014/09/tullamore-distillery.html" class="postlink">one about the new distillery</a>. Although the blogs were written before the night, they cover a lot of the information we got from John Quinn.<br /><br />Hope this helps. Sure let us know if you would like some more information.</div>

				<div class="content">Ken, thank you so much for the Tullamore tasting night. I really enjoyed it, as did the rest of my table. Some really good whiskeys in there too.<br /><br />Thanks for mentioning the articles on my site too. I hope you don't mind, I put a couple of links under the text so people don't have to hunt for them.<br /><br />Did anyone go looking for the Phoenix Celebratory Exclusive afterwards? I looked for it in the CWS but only saw the original Phoenix. They said it was in stock though, at €118, quite a bit more than I was expecting.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi David,<br /><br />I saw it this week in the Irish Whiskey Collection in Dublin Airport for around €85. It was available from both T1 &amp; T2.<br />You would need a keen eye to spot the difference between the packaging on the Single Batch vs the regular Phoenix.<br /><br />I see there was a tie between these two at the tasting. Were they noticeably different?<br /><br />Interested in people's comparisons,<br /><br />Cheers TWB</div>

Certainly more oak on the Celebratory but not excessive.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi David,<br /><br />Delighted to hear that you and your table enjoyed the night and the whiskies. A lot of effort went into the organisation of it, so its great to get some positive feedback.  <br /><br />Thank you so much for supporting the event. It was much appreciated. I did not get to talk to you and anyone else at that table on the night unfortunately. The night went so quick, ye were all gone before I got a chance to.<br /><br />I would also personally like to thank all at Tullamore D.E.W., the I.W.S. committee, the D.I.T.,  the Guild of Sommeliers and everyone else for making it such an enjoyable night. <br /><br />Regarding your links, I have no problem with that. I would have added the links myself, but I was not 100% on how to. I have always read Liquid Irish, it is excellent! This is why I personally have  no problem recommending it to others to read. <br /><br />Regarding the Phoenix Celeb. - I spoke to the Tullamore D.E.W. visitors centre today. It is selling fast. As of 4.30 today they had 10 bottles in stock. The cost at the visitors centre is €90.00.<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Ken<br /><br />Ken</div>
