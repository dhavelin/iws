				<div class="content">I was sent a photo of a Jameson bottle earlier today. The owner would like to get some info on it.<br /><br />I think it's 70's but I'm not certain. I also think it could really be from the Bow Street Distillery. I know it says Bow Street on the label but they had that on the labels in the 80's when the whiskey came from Midleton.</div>

				<div class="content">Midleton until i get a convincing counter argument. My belief for what its worth<br />is that for it to be Bow St. it should say 'Dublin Whiskey' &amp; not Irish Whiskey. For<br />the first year or two Jameson Red Seal said 'Dublin Whiskey' when the brand first <br />launched.</div>

				<div class="content">Would kind of agree with Raven on the usage of Bow St.<br /><br />This is obviously an Itialian bottling.<br /><br />And looks late 70's at the earliest or even 80's.<br /><br />However what I find interesting is it has a Cork <br /><br />and the statement<br /><br />&quot;bottled in bond by&quot;<br /><br />So could well be a Bow Steet offering as there could well have been stocks of that well into the early 80's.<br /><br />Curious.</div>

				<div class="content">Good argument as the bottle of Red seal Dublin Whiskey I have is identical in most respects to <br />that pictured especially the distinctive Red Seal. Possible that they deliberately dropped the 'Dublin' <br />for 'Irish' especially for export markets for category identification purposes. If there is a Forum <br />reader/contributor from the IDL 70's operations they may be able to definitely put this one to bed <br />otherwise we are just guessing.</div>

				<div class="content">I've been digging trough some photos of bottles of Jameson and found a couple of bottles that are easier to date I believe. When they are compared to the bottle above they look much newer. I'm more certain that that's an early Red Seal bottle. The font on the red seal is different too.<br /><br />I've attached various examples from the late 70's to 80's.<div class="inline-attachment">

		</div> The one that says Red Seal Whiskey, center bottle of 5, is from the 70's. The AVB is 70 proof. <br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

		</dl>
		</div>The one in the center of 3 bottles is a little later as it states both 70 proof and 40%.I think proof was removed from bottles in Ireland in 1980.<br /><br />There's an Italian bottle to the right of that bottle that's from the 80's. These would have been labeled in Dublin.</div>
