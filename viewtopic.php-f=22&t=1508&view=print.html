				<div class="content">All this reading about whiskey and specially SPS makes you thirsty. But to day that will be solved as I have got my bottle of Redbreeast 15y.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Good for me <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">Well, question was - lot of fuss about almost nothing or a rather good dram OR a great new way of whiskey drinking? Sitting here by the fire, not evaluating to much I clearly sence that this taste whiskey. No heavy stuff, more of the delicate side. Can't say that I'm not appreciate a god Ardbeg or Lagavulin but I also raise my glass for  Arran, Glenmorangie or something definitely lighter. There is a good thing that I'm working tomore else there woukd have been the risk that I should have emptied the bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi MyIrishHome, great to hear your thoughts on RB15, keep them coming.<br /><br />I'm wondering what year the RB15 you have is (Please check bottle code if you can).<br /><br />I drink a lot of single malt scotch also and I find that the RB15 as a heavy. Just picking up on you saying it is not heavy.<br /><br />Now not arguing with you as that is your thoughts and those are correct for you. I'm just wondering why you think it is not heavy.<br /><br />True this is not sherry monster and is not an in your face flavour explosion but the whiskey itself I feel is a heavy whiskey verging on oily.<br /><br />So the question is how do people define heavy whiskey?<br /><br />I notice you mention Lagavulin. For me Lagavulin 16 is a shadow if what it used to be (where has all that damp bonfire smoke gone?) and I think the RB 15 would be on a par with the Laga virtually flavour wise if you take out the smoke. Not saying they are anyway the same flavour profile as they are obviously very different but from a heaviness point of view in a similar vein for me. But yes it is very drinkable  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> <br /><br />Anyway it is great that people can get so many different things from a whiskey from what others may get.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm drinking from a bottle marked L123031273. What year that make out is out of my knowledge. Missed a small word in my description. Not heavy peaty stuff would be more correct I think. Just as I missed a small word when reading your comment first.  I read &quot;Just picking on you saying it is not heavy.&quot;  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> Well, improving my English is kind of side effect to spending time at this forum. So to make it clear, Redbreast is definitely a medium to full bodied whisky like Longmorn or an other favourite of mine, Old Pulteney. I do find the finish surprisingly flatter then the smell and first mouth feel. So I think we are more agreed then it first seamed.</div>
