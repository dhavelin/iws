				<div class="content">Hey guys! I was curious to know if anyone has dared to enter the realm of home-made whiskey. I've had friends attempt it (and fail), but I want to know if any of you whiskey aficionados know anything about making it on your own. I've always wanted to make it, but have been afraid of the horrid concoction I would produce. . . or I've been afraid of explosions (don't ask). So, has anyone made whiskey successfully? How long did it take?</div>

				<div class="content">It's illegal in Ireland so for most people here the answer is no. (Even if they have, they won't admit it <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />)</div>

				<div class="content">I make my own whiskey and sell it to teenagers outside discos. It's the least I can do. <br /><br />Very illegal here to make your own whiskey, I think. Or your own spirits.</div>

				<div class="content">My oldest brother attempted to build a still and brew up some moonshine / poteen. I didn't taste very good. Yuck. But it was a rather efficient paint remover. Could probably be used as rocket fuel. <br /><br />I make hard apple cider for holiday gifts each year. Not exactly whiskey, more like wine. But it's good!<br /><br />*hic*</div>

				<div class="content">If you'd like a look a the craft of poit√≠n making you could do worse than get this DVD: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT4kyO0FH9Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT4kyO0FH9Q</a><!-- m --> &amp; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_dHFWUOVzw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_dHFWUOVzw</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I alas have no direct knowledge of how to make it.  I would counsel all those thinking of getting a bottle of poteen or making their own to be very careful, apart from legal implications unless you know what you're at, you'll get methanol poisoning.  Plus there are a lot of shysters out there who distil it in old oil drums and keep in old plastic barrels that used to hold weedkiller.  <br /><br />But like beer brewkits and so on, it may just be illegal to sell it, not to make it for home use. But again I've not specialist knowledge.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>cathach wrote:</cite>But like beer brewkits and so on, it may just be illegal to sell it, not to make it for home use.</div></blockquote><br />It's illegal to make it in Ireland. I will ask our crack legal team to dig up a copy of the 1831 Illicit Distillation Act. We should state this clearly in our rules, just to keep on the right side of the law.<br /><br />The government is steadily replacing all pre-1922 legislation so perhaps we have an opportunity to make a submission on this topic.</div>

				<div class="content">The History Channel last night had a show on about the history of distilling. It featured an experienced moonshiner showing how to do it. Very simple ingredients (corn, yeast, water), a little heat, and a way to cool the steam.<br /><br />&quot;Don't do this at home&quot;.<br /><br />Moonshine isn't aged in charred oak barrels, as bourbon, Irish, and scotch are. That's where the flavor and color comes from. Raw moonshine is clear, and VERY strong in flavor, and you can't drink it without cutting it with something with a taste.<br /><br />Moth is right. It had all the charm of kerosene. But I had to try.</div>
