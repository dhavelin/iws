				<div class="content">Hi All,<br />The forum has developed really well in the past number of months with the number of members increasing all the time and the topic and post figures rocketing skyward. Against that successful backdrop of course it is easy to forget that we actually have a 'website' also and we shouldn't limit ourselves to the forum alone. Has anyone any ideas as to how the actual homepage should be developed. Should we have our own history, brands, specialist retailer/pub locator, society members-only sections as well as the great forum?<br />Just my two cents worth!<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">Indeed, this is a topic that has come up at the committee meetings. We want the website to be the ultimate reference for Irish whiskey so history, brands, bottlings, etc. should all appear eventually. There will also be a record of the society's tastings and more info on upcoming events.<br /><br />Various people have promised to contribute the content above. In the meantime, I'm spending as much time as I can to add support for these things to the site.<br /><br />Also, while the look of the website is pretty spartan at the moment, that will change when we get a design identity for the society (logo, colour scheme, font, etc.).<br /><br />Stay tuned!</div>
