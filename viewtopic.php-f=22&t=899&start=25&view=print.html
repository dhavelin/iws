So some of the better bourbon barrels give up quite a deep colour. I think we are so used to seeing single casks very pale in colour and the more I here from Midleton the more I think alot of this single casks are either inferior wood or second fill bourbon. Midletons cask management and selection seems to be second to none. It's quite extraordinary what they do down there.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah that does make sense. If bourbon barrells weren't capable of giving colour then how would you explain the dark colour of bourbon. But I think we may be onto something here - a lot of older single casks are refill and for a very good reason. A first fill cask could probably overpower the whiskey more quickly than a 2nd or 3rd fill. If you think of some of the really old whiskeys out the - the 25 - 40 yr old - most of these as far as I've noticed, have been refill casks. <br /><br />Which in one sense shows the nonsense of the whole age statement obsession - if whiskey matures more quickly in a 1st fill the how can you compare a 12yo first fill to a 12yo second fill.<br /><br />Also, and in particular with reference to Midleton, the colour and sweetness effect of a new bourbon barrell on a relatively light whiskey could, I suppose, give the impression that caramel is involved. Though JM should know better.<br /><br />And I agree, we probably don't give IDL enough credit - they've been way ahead of even Scotland in pioneering wood policy.</div>

This I always took as a bit of marketing but now after having a chance to talk to David Quinn (Master of Science), Billy Leighton (Master Blender) last week &amp; even Barry Crocket (Master Distiller) briefly at the PPS trasting I now believe that they worry more about the quality than the age.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>IainB wrote:</cite>Also, and in particular with reference to Midleton, the colour and sweetness effect of a new bourbon barrell on a relatively light whiskey could, I suppose, give the impression that caramel is involved.

It is only the fact it is writen on the bottle that people don't even mention the caramel taste for fear people get the wrong impression. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>IainB wrote:</cite>And I agree, we probably don't give IDL enough credit - they've been way ahead of even Scotland in pioneering wood policy.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Could not agree with you more</div>

Nor am I sure that they are detecting the caramel additive at all, but I don't know, as I have never had two identical whiskeys with one altered with caramel. But some say it stops a whisky short - flattens the development of the flavours. <br /><br />Oak does impart some sweetness on a whisk(e)y. Most of the caramel flavours you get in whisky comes from the wood, I think. I am not sure I've ever had new spirit with all that much caramel flavour in it, although maybe others have. It's usually fruity esters I get. <br /><br />I get burnt sugar in a lot of Irish whiskey, and I love this flavour. The cell walls of organic material like wood is made up of cellulose, which contains chains of glucose. And as they char this in bourbon barrels, maybe this gives the burnt sugar taste. Just speculating.<br /><br />Legally, with Scotch anyway, you can't put an amount of this colouring in the spirit that is discernible. How you judge this, I don't know.</div>
