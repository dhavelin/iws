				<div class="content">I too have looked into the possibility of setting up a branch in Galway. I think it will take me much longer as I don't have a group to work off. If you have spanish speaking members feel free to open a spanish thread  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Definitely something the Society wishes to promote, the priority in year one is to get the IWS established. <br />Possibilities for 2010 are international membership at a reduced fee (committee will discuss this). Still lots of ideas on the table, and your own input would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />In the meantime you would be more than welcome to organise your own group (which I think you do informally anyway) and be ready for 'official recognition' <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  what the time comes. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />AFAIK you were enthusiastic about the IWS recommended whisky pubs idea.</div>
