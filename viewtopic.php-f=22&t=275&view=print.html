				<div class="content">I like Bushmills, but am not a massive fan. So there is not much point in me keeping all my Bushmills. <br /><br />If anyone wants to buy a Bushmills 5 year old, a Bushmills Rum Cask (in wooden box, for Celtic Whiskey Shop, distilled 1989) and maybe a Bushmills Millennium 1985 (not sure about this yet), let me know. I don't know the values of these, so if anyone has any idea, let me know. I will try to do a good deal. I also have a Bushmills Millennium 1608. <br /><br />I might have a few more Bushmills single casks. I'll have a look.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello John,<br />Always liked the Rum cask - I'd be interested in that.  <br />Never tasted the 5yo - what's it like?<br />Sadly, I find the 10yo not at all to my taste - I must try it again and see if I can pinpoint why.<br />/M</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Michael,<br /><br />I have not tasted this particular rum cask, but I've tasted another and it was unusual, but nice. Surprisingly dry for something coming from a rum cask. You are welcome to it if you want it. <br /><br />I tasted the five year old about five years ago while on my honeymoon in Italy. To be honest, I can't remember if it was good, bad or indifferent. You probably already know this, but it was produced exclusively for the Italian market. Not sure they make it any more.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />John</div>

				<div class="content">@John: PM sent.<br />@Michael: The five year old is a very clean expression of Bush's spirit. Made for the Italians as John says, and long discontinued. I like, but it is very much of the 'family' of the 10 yo.<br />I tend to find Bushes fall into two 'families' - the grassy, bourbon influenced White Bush, 5 yo and 10 yo (and single bourbon casks); and the sumptuous toffee sherry-influenced Black Bush, 12 yo distillery reserve, old duty free 1608 12 yo, 16 yo, 21 yo (and single sherry casks.)<br />The new 1608 anniversary edition and the 'Select Casks' duty free edition vatted with Carribean rum cask finished Bush (and the single rum casks) offer a welcome variation from these two family styles.</div>
