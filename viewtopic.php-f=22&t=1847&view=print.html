				<div class="content">....of the regularly available bottlings was for a long long time Lagavulin 16 but I'm starting to switch my allegiance to Laphroaig 18 which has to be one of the finest peated malts available. There's a few other contenders like the Laphroaig quarter cask, Bowmore 25 and Bunna 25 but the first two are way ahead of the posse.<br /><br />Any thoughts anyone?<br /><br />As regards not so readily available ones I still haven't found anything quite like the Laga 21 from a few years back.</div>

Wonderfully austere.   <br /><br />Concur with the old Laga 21, or maybe a PE or '77 Ardbeg for hard to get.</div>

(and only €73 a bottle when first released!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  ).<br /><br />Subsequent releases, to my mind, have flagged a little.  Still, a lovely drop if you have €90 to spare on a bottle (you'll get two bottles of Quarter Cask for that!)<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_ugeek.gif" alt=":ugeek:" title="Uber Geek" /></div>

				<div class="content">once upon a time i would have said Lagavulin 16 without a blink but, as hard as it is for me to say it, either they're not what they once were or i just have a rosy memory of my first encounters with them. As it stands, i'm a big fan of the Port Charlotte PC6 release. If we're talking about non-recent releases as well though, the 70's Ardbegs are difficult to top.</div>

				<div class="content">My whisky 'career' is only about two years along, but my original Lagavulin 16 experience was awesome.  However, the most recent bottling that I have tasted (in my next door neighbours' cabinet) is not as smoke or full flavoured as the bottle in my cabinet, from just the previous year.<br /><br />Port Charlotte 'An Turas Mor' (which is being replaced by The Peat Project in the near future, iirc) is one of my other favourites.  Laph Quarter Cask and Ardbeg Uigeadail (fairly ahead of the Corryvreckan, imho) are also contenders.  Generally, I do not like the 'vegetal/earthy' peat of most Caol Ila and Bowmore that I have had, as much as the 'sweet' peat of Laga 16 and Uigeadail.</div>

				<div class="content">Ardbeg for me. And not because of the cult, Ardbeg 10 opened my eyes to malt whisky, i bought an L6 from a dusty wine shop near Lincoln Cathedral many years ago and it really got me going. Even though i'd been drinking malts for years i'd not ever been anywhere near a specialists, or even heard of Ardbeg. The 10yo and the 'Oogie are my favourites and have been for some years. It's nice to have some complexity poking it's head through the peat.<br /><br />Like many i fell out of love with the Laga 16, many years ago now, but the 12 is ok. Laphroaig is my second over all, but only the 18yo and the 10yo CS really get my nads pumping, the rest of them i find just too oafish and clumsy and i find the 10 disappointing. <br /><br />Coming up quickly behind Laphroaig is Kilchoman. I'm liking Kilchoman a lot. Maybe it's already in second place, thinking of the next bottle to open and i'm more eager for a Kilchoman.</div>

My next Laga purchase (whenever that may be) will likely be the 12 CS.<br />- A bottle of QC is waiting to be opened (I'm holding off on my never ending quest to keep my open bottle collection to less than 30.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> )<br />- I am hoping/hopeful that the LCBO in Ontario brings in the Laph 10 CS.
