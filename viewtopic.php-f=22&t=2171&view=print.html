				<div class="content">Hi all, I am looking to find out a little bit of information regarding a bottle of whiskey that I believe to be old. The bottle is labeled Taylors old Irish whisky with a house of commons trademark 70% proof and 26 fl oz and bottled by P O'Kane &amp; CO Ltd. I believe it might have connection a to the coleraine distillery. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Very good quality picture of what could be a similar label ON<br />page 84 OF JIM MURRAY'S BOOK 'Classic Irish Whiskey' published by<br />Prion books 1997. If you can upload a picture it would be helpful ! Yes<br />it would have been a Coleraine Whiskey. Even as early as 1845 it was <br />for sale in the Bars of the House of Commons.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi raven thanks for the reply. Please see attached photo. The bottle wouldn't be in great condition, any idea on the age of the contents.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xfl58hbj1cnxuly/IMG_20140325_183140.jpg" class="postlink">https://www.dropbox.com/s/xfl58hbj1cnxuly/IMG_20140325_183140.jpg</a></div>

				<div class="content">A classic Irish Malt from the old Coleraine Distillery. They we one of very few that done Malt whiskey only. At one time Bushmill's would heve been a Pot Still Whiskey Distillery.<br /><br />I'm quessing that bottle to be pre 1920. Taylors would have owned it until the '20, I think Boyd's, Bushmills owners, owned the distillery in the '30 and didn't use the label but again I'm not sure.<br /><br />It's unusual to see the volume and proof on such an old bottle too. Great find and thanks for posting.</div>

				<div class="content">I would say much later, again it is a distillery label for a Donegal Spirit Merchant, P.O.Kane &amp; Co Ltd, given there is both volume and abv information it is most likely 1950s, even tho Coleraine stop distilling then, stocks can linger for years. I my opinion it is a late bottling from 1950s/60s that is in poor condition.</div>

				<div class="content">That makes more sense. I assumed they had discontinued the label when Boyds took over. The fact that volume and Abv makes it late.<br />I wasn't thinking clearly last night when I replied, it could have been those 2 or 3 or more Pot Stills at last night tasting. <br /><br />Thanks again for posting Jimmad.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the replies guys, the bottle was given to my father from a pub owner here in Donegal, judging by the layers of smoke on the bottle it had to be there for some time. The cork on the top has a plastic coating so that again leads me to believe it is more recent. The contents of the bottle remain so I think it has never been opened. I don't suppose its worth anything of great value other than maybe a good drink <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Ok for me the plastic seal combined with 70 proof and fluid ounces puts it clearly in the mid 1970s, and therefore it raises the question on whether it is pure Coleraine single malt in the bottle, it could even be Bushmills malt or Bushmills malt and coleraine grain. Interesting conundrum tho! Without further providence difficult to say.</div>
