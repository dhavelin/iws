                Hi! I am writing a crime novel set in Norway in 1916. My
                detective prefers irish whiskey of the more exclusive kind. I
                have a dispute with my editor about what would be considered
                exclusive irish whiskey in the 1910s. Would Jameson be in this
                group?

                Jameson was available back then but there were 2 of them.
                William Jameson and John Jameson operated independent of each
                other. Both would have been common at the time. <br /><br />If
                you were looking for something exclusive at the time I'd
                recommend Nicholas Devereaux Bishop's Water Whisky in Wexford or
                Cassidy's in Monasterevan(I don't know if they used the 'E' in
                whiskey or not. <br />I know Devereaux's spelt it Whisky, they
                also stopped making whiskey at the outbreak of World War 1(1914)
                but they would have been supplies for a few more years.

                these two up. Would be nice to have my detective drink an
                exclusive irish whiskey not very common today, so I will
                probably change to one of these

                <br /><br />Hi Teike,<br /><br />Best of luck on the Novel.
                Irionically the timing of your novel is the last hurray for the
                great Irish whiskey industry as once World War 1, prohibition
                and Irish Rising (1916) &amp; Irish Civil War kicked in the
                death knell was well and truly on the way and a total decline of
                the industry by the early 20's. This was also the time when
                Blends started to gain more wide spread appeal as they were
                cheaper and for some palates milder and more approachable etc.
                I'll try and give you some food for thought.<br /><br />just a
                word on Cassidy's &amp; Devereux, although I do like the names,
                these would have been small opperations and mainly supplied the
                locality and possibly branched out to some bigger cities in the
                United Kingdom as Ireland was a part of at the time. Max Annual
                out put for Deveraux's was 110,000 gallons which is good but
                still quite small. Although Cassidy's was just above 200,000
                which would be enough for export but there has been historical
                accounts to suggest they supplied locally mainly. The big Dublin
                Distilleries would have had actual output near or above 1million
                gallons per annum. So if you want to be factually correct you
                may need to avoid the small local distilleries but the names
                could well be thing to go by. However, there is no reason why
                any whiskey Brand could not have found their way around the
                world though as that is how the UK worked. everything dispatched
                by ship to the 4 corners.<br /><br />The main 4 irish
                Distilleries of the time were based in Dublin and were known as
                the &quot;The Big 4&quot; These were John Jameson &amp; Son,
                James Power &amp; Son, William Jameson &amp; Co and George Roe
                but part of the DDC (Dublin Distillers Company) at the time. DDC
                was an almangum of a few distilleries and they continued to
                bottle under their own names and it was a bit messy. Only J
                Jameson &amp; Powers survived.<br /><br />Jameson was biggest
                internationally back then as it is today. Jameson only sold
                Whiskey by the barrell back then. Therefore in Ireland each and
                every public bar bottled their own Jameson (Under a standardise
                Jameson label) but added their own name on it.<br /><br />i.e.<br /><br /><a

                ><br /><br />And they shipped abroad in the same manor too. To
                be honest I woud not know the workings of the Norweigen market
                of the time but we can take an educated guess on the back of the
                exports to the UK &amp; US. So in the States there was Companies
                such as Taylor &amp; Co in New York who Marketed it in 2 forms,
                3Star which was the regular version (Probably anywhere between a
                7-12year old whiskey) &amp; the more up market 5star which was
                thought to be over 20years old.<br /><br />This is an actual 5
                Star from the period. Note the majority of whiskey of this time
                had driven corks lead capsules and imperfections in the bottle
                like small air bubbles.<br /><a

                ><br /><br />Powers was huge in Ireland and remaind the top
                selling Irish whiskey until Jameson only over took it in the
                last decade or so. They were the first Irish whiskey company to
                bottle at source (1886) and labeled with the now famous gold
                label and it was just know as Gold Label for some time. They
                also invented the Mini or Baby Powers (1900) as it was called at
                the time.<br /><br />However Bushmills was also very big at the
                time and they also did bottle their own. It is arguable that
                they may have been bigger in Europe than Jameson but these
                statements are hard to authenticate.<br /><br />Theirs was a
                more normal issue of one main brand and seemed to excell at
                their &quot;Pure Malt&quot; which got many plaudits at the time.
                As reported by Bushmills themselves. &quot;<span

                Exhibition in 1883, The only Gold medal in the Exposition
                Universelle Paris 1889 (Where the Shah of Persia was recorded as
                recieving a bottle of Bushmills), Chicago 1893, St Louis 1904
                and the London - Franco (British) Exhibition of 1908. It's seems
                by far the most decorated Irish whiskey of this time.
                <br /><br />This is the imbossed bottle typical of the time but
                with a label not too unsimilar to this, but with Pure Malt
                rather than an age statement.<br />Notice their claim to fame
                was 1784 back then and not 1608 as the PR guys would like you to
                believe now !!!!<br /><a

                Churchills favourite Irish whiskey ... Locke's Pure Pot Still.
                Or H.S. Persse Very Fine Old which was a renowned Pot Still from
                Galway city. William Jameson was huge in the US and was also
                found in the UK to a lesser extent as they concentrated their
                efforts on the export to US.<br /><br />Old Comber (silent b)
                Pot Still from Comber Co Down in Norther Ireland was a well
                respected pot still of the time and survived till the early
                1950's. As was Dunvilles whiskey from the Royal Irish Distillery
                in Belfast but they tyended to concentrate on Blends and had a
                good name for quality whisky.<br /><br />and of Cocurse I nearly
                forgot another well known distillery of the time and still
                popular Tullamore Dew<br /><br />others<br /><br />McConnell's

                Still (Bandon Distillery)<br />Burke's of Dublin &amp; Liverpool
                (independent Bottlers)<br /><br /><br />there are many more but

                One further thought - but IWC might confirm if the dates are
                applicable - were any of the spot range around at the time -
                Green Spot, Yellow Spot, Red Spot or Blue?<br /><br />They were
                Jameson whiskeys but the Yellow Red and Blue were aged and
                would, I guess, have been exclusive at the time.

                <br /><br />Do you know if there was a series of whiskeys with
                birds names at this time? I remember Leo saying the the bonded
                was into birds (of the feathered variety). Could there have been
                something similar to the Spots where different birds represented
                different ages, I'm only guessing here of course!

                Just a few comments that may be of interest:<br />1. Irish
                Whiskey was predominantly spelt with an 'e' at the time. <br />
                This would have been the case from about 1870 when much of the
                Scotch Whisky being produced was of very poor <br />
                quality. For exportation purposes, Irish distillers therefore
                wished to differentiate their product from the poorer <br />
                Scotch Whisky, thus they added the 'e' to mark the crucial
                distinction;<br />2. There was a strong temperance movement
                evolving in Norway and neighbouring countries during this period
                and<br />
                in 1916 (the time of your novel !!!!), Norway prohibited
                distilled beverages (followed by wine and beer in 1917). The<br />
                prohibition on distilled beverages lasted until 1923.<br />
                Accordingly, your detective might have been fortunate to get his
                hands on any brand of whiskey - let alone an exclusive<br />
                high-end Irish variety.

                Thank you all for all the useful information, comments and
                answeres. I will try to make a decision of what whiskey my
                detective preferred. I guess it will not be easy, but I
                certainly have a lot more brands to choose from now. I will let
                you know. It is funny, but because of the prohibition in 1916,
                many doctors in Norway prescribed distilled beverages for their
                patients on receipt. Some of the doctors even got a reputation
                for being a liquor-doctor (brennevinsdoktor), and some of them
                lost their right to prescribe. Fortunately, my detectives
                companion happens to be a doctor, so hopefully they will get
                hand on some irish whiskey at least

                I think it's fair to say Teike that you have some good
                information there to work with! Just like Irish Whiskey, the
                'Nordic Noir' genre appears to be going from strength to
                strength so best of luck with the novel.<br />All the best,<br />John.
