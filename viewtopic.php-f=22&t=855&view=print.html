				<div class="content">I've put up the poll. I'm not sure which I prefer. I think Bushmills is a little more easy drinking, while Tyrconnell is a little more flavoursome. More variety with the Tyrconnell too, I'd say.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks John. <br /><br />I'd love to say Tyrconnell, they being independent and all but on any given night I'm more likely to have a Bushmills.<br /><br />I deliberately didn't say Cooley or Bushmills - I wanted to compare brand not distillery. I couldn't put Bushmills aread of Cooley given the variety.</div>

				<div class="content">Not strange at all. They were run by the same master distillers for years. They're both triple distilled. They would have had the same barley and cask sources. The brenders were the same which means, as is human nature, there would have been an element of blending to their own taste. And of course the grain whiskey in the blends was exactly the same.</div>

				<div class="content">Have to say so far it's Bush for me but it really is a close call. Some great Tyrconnell single casks and I've not had the chance to get Ally's new one yet. Never got the metalic thing off Bushmills but it really gets me from the regular Jameson</div>

				<div class="content">Bushmills or Tyrconnell?<br />A bit like asking 'wife or daughter'!<br />Both are essential loves of any Irish whiskey connoisseur, and both have unique and different appeals.<br />Personally, Bushmills is the true love. It's hard not to reach for the 21, 16, or the single casks or even a Black Bush without the mind casting back to that first time, that amazement when the taste hit the palate.<br />Sure, the 10 year old isn't for everyone (including me) nor the White Bush neither. But the Brogans and Irishman outputs show that Bush spirit in the 10 year old age range can exceed what the distillery put out under their own bottling.<br />Tyrconnell is a different beast entirely, but just as lovable in its own way. I think it excels the older it gets, and clearly it takes especially well to a good cask finish, as the Port, Madeira, Sherry and now Mallorcan finish bottlings reveal.<br />I'd take a young Tyrconnell over a White Bush any day. I'd have to stop and pause, but might still take it even over a Black Bush.<br />At 10 yo, the Tyrconnell wins out over Bush, unless the Bush is an independent bottling.<br />At 16, the Bush edges it (but I would say that - it's my all-time favourite go-to dram.) But only just. The 17 yo Tyrconnells have been exceptional.<br />I wonder how they'll go head to head at 21! If the Tyrconnell continues to improve, it will give even the extraordinary Bush 21 yo a run for its money.<br />Fair play to Cooley for the work they've done with Tyrconnell. It offers the old guard at Bushmills a few ideas as to how to innovate and freshen up the Bush range, which while still superb is beginning to look a little stale with no new products since the 1608 anniversary malt.</div>

I loved a lot of the bushmills single casks but they have pulled back and cooley have kicked on ... All can ask is give us some more single casks but don't cruify us on price ... it is not that big of a deal bottling a cask so get a grip.</div>
