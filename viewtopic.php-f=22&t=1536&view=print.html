I would see this as the end for a lot of the supermarket own brand bottlings of Irish Whiskey</div>

				<div class="content">That's a shame. The Cooley-produced Avoca whiskey in Aldi is a very decent whiskey for it's price and I'll definitely be stocking up on it.</div>

				<div class="content">end of days for a lot of odd (albeit usually nothing special) brands. I'll miss the sainsbury single malt. still, as mentioned earlier, its an extra incentive for new distilleries to open up</div>

				<div class="content">out of curiosity, since today is the 100th anniversary of the titanic's sinking... do that lot have a contract with Cooley or will Danny Boy and company need to find some other means of erm... staying afloat?</div>
