Bless him, he reckoned I'd probably drank my fill of Jameson, Powers and Bush so he thought to get me something different.<br /><br />Well, a gift's a gift, so I didn't bother telling him this was made to be drowned in coffee and cream! In short, I'd have taken the Powers a million times over if given the chance.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste people's time with tasting notes. It's tastes like wood-flavoured vodka. That's it. I'm drinking it not out of punishment duty, but because I prefer even basic whiskey to an Irish coffee (I'm strange like that) and because I wanted to recalibrate my taste buds after the string of awesome whiskeys we've had at recent tastings.<br /><br />Truth be told, I've been spoilt with splendid drams - some of my own and some kindly served to me by the IWS. Supping a Dunphy's or too brings me back down to Earth so to speak. I don't mean to be too hard on it. It's not meant to be drunk neat and it's no worse than many supermarket whiskeys. But it's no Bushmills single sherry cask, Tyrconnell 17 year old or Redbreast 15 year old, you know what I mean?</div>

I had a guy who was convinced he had one of the Old Combers in his possession  since the 60's eventhough it was only bottled in the 80's  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>varizoltan wrote:</cite><br />second, Burkes as far as i know was started 1891, so it can be that<br />third,  this type if bottles was used just before the round bottles (Dave Quinn said) and the roundones really appearded mostly just before prohibition, and were used after for some time too<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Good to know, can you post up a picture of your bottle, even if it does not have a label. Or mail me one ... Thanks a mill Z  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br />You never said iof it was any good to drink or not.</div>
