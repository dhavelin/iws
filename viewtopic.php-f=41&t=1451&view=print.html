				<div class="content">Hi RayGeorge,<br />There's no picture but I know what you have. It was the first year of the now iconic Midleton Very Rare. There are quiet allot still  about. I think i paid about €350 for the last one i bought when you include commission etc. <br />If I was to value it I say €300-€400. On a good day you'd get more. I seen the likes of the 1986(+ Pewter measure to my knowledge) is fetching nearly €700.  <br />You could try Ally at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/">http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/</a><!-- m --> or <br />Sukhinder Singh at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/">http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/</a><!-- m --><br />if you wanted to sell it but may not get what you'd hoped. <br />I'd personally keep it for a few more years.</div>
