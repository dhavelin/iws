				<div class="content">The most famous whiskey would be Greenspot,<br /><br />Obviously and of the Distillery Reserves available direct from the distillery only. Bushmills, Jameson &amp; Midleton distillery reserves and the Kilbeggan Distillery Malt<br /><br />The CelticWhiskeyShop has a single cask Connemara 18yo &amp; 17yo Sherry Finish, and a soon to be released Palo Cortado Sherry Cask finished Connemara.<br /><br />The best whiskey selections are available at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com">www.celticwhiskeyshop.com</a><!-- w --> and the new Irish Whiskey Collection at T2 in Dublin Airport.<br /><br />Another to look out for is Tullamore Dew Black.<br /><br />What can you get locally?</div>

				<div class="content">hey WGK,<br /><br />as a fellow yank with a history of bringing bottles back and forth across the atlantic, i'd recommend you pick up a bottle of Green Spot from the Celtic Whiskey Shop on Dawson Street. It's pretty difficult to find outside the republic of ireland, completely unavailable in the U.S., jaw-droppingly brilliant stuff, and even marked at a reasonable value (40 euros a bottle). There are plenty of specialty Cooley bottlings and distillery reserves etc if you're looking to build a collection but if you just want a prize bottle to share with your friends, you can't really do any better and especially not for that money. GS is also one of the last continuously produced SPS whiskeys so if your friends are Redbreast fans, you'll have something special to show off.</div>
