				<div class="content">I know many of us have been busy sampling various Whiskeys and poitins in the last few months to give our vote on which is the best, or best of a bad bunch  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />. Little has been updated on the <a href="http://irishwhiskeyawards.com/" class="postlink">webpage</a>.<br /><br />I got this from the <a href="http://www.whiskylive.com/ireland/114/dublin-2014" class="postlink">Whisky Live site</a>.<br /><br />On Thursday 23rd October the Irish Whiskey Awards will take place at Kilbeggan distillery. These awards are voted for by members of both the Celtic Whiskey Club and the Irish Whiskey Society. The awards link they provided is faulty, follow the one above.<br /><br />Sadly no other details have been confirmed.</div>

Ticket price will include coach from Dublin city centre to Kilbeggan and back, hot &amp; cold canapes, Irish Whiskey cocktails on arrival, tour of Kilbeggan distillery &amp; tasting of all this year’s winning whiskeys. Tickets are priced at €54.50 and will include a donation of €14.50 per ticket to Mary’s Meals <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.marysmeals.ie/">http://www.marysmeals.ie/</a><!-- m --> which should raise enough money to feed 80 kids in the poorest parts of the world for 1 year – that’s 29200 dinners!<br /> <br />Event: Irish Whiskey Awards 2014<br />Date: Thursday 23rd October, 2014<br />Time: Coach leaves  Dublin city centre at 4.15pm sharp, coach to depart Kilbeggan distillery at around 9.30pm.<br />If you want to make alternative travel plans the tours, canapes &amp; cocktails will start at 5.30pm at Kilbeggan distillery with the awards ceremony starting at 7.30pm.<br />Venue: Kilbeggan Distillery, County Westmeath<br /> <br />Tickets: €54.50, only available from the Celtic Whiskey Shop or by phone 01 675 9744.
