Some potentially cool marketing opportunities for Teeling to generate buzz going forward.<br /><br />Any info on the ratio of Cooley vs. Bruichladdich within the blend?  I will assume that this is not a case of &quot;teaspooning&quot; (i.e. 99% of one, and 1% of the other, whisk(e)y)</div>

				<div class="content">I didn't comment on the veracity of the 'only Irish-owned' claim. My point was that they made such a big deal out of that fact and then went ahead and put the business into foreign ownership. I don't believe that patriotism enters the equation in private-sector commerce Iain. Credit where it's due, they did produce some styles of whiskey that hadn't been produced here in a while.</div>

While there may be little in the way of paperwork for starting up a whiskey distillery (an assumption on my part, taken from the article), that doesn't mean that &quot;start up costs are miniscule&quot;.  All distilling equipment, plus the gap in revenue generation while waiting for the majority of whiskey stock to age, creates huge start up costs.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Adrian / GWH,<br />I read that article too, and I also had more questions than answers when I was finished. Barry Walsh was retained as a consultant if memory serves so I'm sure they didn't go too far off the mark; though I would love to know exactly how they're maturing the Kennedy Whiskey brand. Maybe someone from the Distillery could give us a high level overview?</div>

				<div class="content">One of their employees told me earlier in the year that Kennedy is matured for 2 years. If so, it explains why it's not labelled &quot;Irish whiskey&quot; and perhaps why it's not sold in Ireland.<br /><br />The guy I spoke with didn't seem intimately familiar with the production process so I didn't press him. The company promised to contact me later and I also emailed them but I never found out any more.</div>

				<div class="content">interesting article from the Sunday independent Business section. I did not like those three<br />lines though ----[b]<span style="font-style: italic"> 'They believe their unique maturation process, developed by John and based <br />on proprietary &quot;infusion technology&quot;, a method that gives their whiskey an older taste than its <br />actual age, will be a big advantage in taking on other brands'</span>-------.<br />Maybe I am too fond of the old traditional side of distilling and that there is no quick fix where maturation is <br />concerned. By the way &amp; pardon my ignorance what is proprietary 'infusion technology'  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> <br /><br />It is on sale here in the Republic. I think I paid 19 Euro for a bottle in Supervalu two/three weeks ago.I hadn't <br />spotted though the absence of the word 'Irish'. Next year the word 'Irish' will probably appear on label once the <br />three year term is reached. A tasting will follow and if no good 'Hot Toddy' season beckons !!!</div>

I thought this was because Kennedy didn't meet the defintion of &quot;Irish whiskey&quot; contained in Irish law. But the EU has a 3-year rule for whiskey generally so if it's being sold here it should be 3 years old (and no unusual maturation techniques either).<br /><br />I'm sure I was told 2 years a few months ago because it really surprised me at the time but perhaps their sales guy was mistaken.</div>
