				<div class="content">There are some similar ones. I'd like to write to the Whisky Magazine and find out how the came to their choices. <br /><br />There is certainly an opportunity for us to have an input in the choice. I'd hate to see tourist driving half way into the country and find a pub that doesn't even have a bottle of Powers on display. There should be a standard.</div>

				<div class="content">I was in the Dingle Whiskey Bar on Nassau street next to the Porterhouse. They have an excellent selection. <br /><br />I met Willie from the Palace with 2 other publicans. One was from the Long Hall on Georges street. They are expanding their range too.</div>

				<div class="content">It is getting fairly wide spread these days.<br /><br />My knowledge could be a little rusty now as I'm out of the city a long while now but ...<br /><br />Temple bar general area would be a good spot during the day.<br /><br />You have the likes of the Temple Bar bar which have a vast array of whiskeys<br />Oliver St John Gogarty's do a few.<br />The Porter house (which brews it's own beer) usually has a fairly decent stock is on Parliament Street (end of temple bar.)<br />Bow's bar at the opposite end of Temple bar (Fleet Street I think) used to have a great stock.<br />Palace bar as already mentioned has a lovely whiskey bar room up stairs (not sure on it's opening hours though).<br /><br />However the Vat House (behind the central Bank / Part of Blooms hotel) is also well worth a trip just to look at some really expensive whiskey. And if you are lucky they might have a few older bottles where the prices have remained the same but are actually tempting now, but that is just a guess on my behalf.<br /><br />Where to go after that I think maybe a local Spar and get a few bottles of water <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div>
