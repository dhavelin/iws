				<div class="content">I didn't know that. Or expect it, since I had the impression that the 12yo was to replace the vintage releases.<br /><br />Looking at their website I see:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Although our standard offering will be the 12 year old single malt, we will continue to have special bottlings of rare and unique distillations which will most likely bear a vintage date.</div></blockquote><br />So we will still see Knappogue vintages.<br /><br />Do you have an opinion, Apples, which of the 12yo and 1998 you prefer?</div>

				<div class="content">They taste quite different. I'm not sure it's 12 yrs old. I just subtracted 1998 from 2010. Sure amn't I great?<br /><br />The bottles look similar too.</div>

				<div class="content">I have a bottle of this and yes it was bottled in 2010 so I think it is reasonable to say it is 12 years old.<br /><br />Knappogue have confirmed that the 12 Year Old age statement will be the regular release from now on, however they have said they will continue to release vintage dated releases from time to time, so the 1998 will be more collectable and so should hold its value.<br /><br />I tasted them both before I bought and preferred the vintage 1998 release, hope that helps...</div>

				<div class="content">I planned on tasting the 12yo and the 1998 head to head tonight but John M scuppered that on another topic by asking about the closest Scottish distillery to Bushmills and I'm up to my neck here in Auchentoshans Hazelburns Bushmills and Bunnahabhainns. (I take your tasks very seriously John!) I know I could include these two knappogues as part of the research but to be honest things are complicated enough. I'll put it on the list for tomorrow. <br /><br />On topic, I understand from Ally the the 1998 is definitely a 12yo also. But then, what does he know about whiskey?</div>
