				<div class="content">Maybe it is just me but those whiskey detective guys are a little strange.<br /><br />They only like Dew and Jameson Irish Whiskey...<br /><br />They don't like Rye in their Manhattan...<br /><br />They put ice in everything...<br /><br />I know that everyone has their opinion and today most people feel the need to tell everyone about it in a blog.  But I would not agree with most of what they are saying or doing.<br /><br />If you are going to tell everyone what whiskey they should buy, don't have a large hunk of ice in every picture and only like the market leading brands.  I can find out that information from any drinks salesman.</div>

Not a sausage about their companies' plans!<br /><br />The only new content was from a French Pernod Ricard guy who said Jameson was now to look at Asia, which I regard as very significant, and who mentioned opening up new African markets outside South Africa.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Raven wrote:</cite>I feel the article was more to make the general<br />public aware of the 'Renaissance' that is happening in the industry rather <br />than being over specific.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Fair point. We could use a lot more public awareness of and support for this growing craft industry.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Raven wrote:</cite>Page 3 of the Irish Examiner today also carries news of papers filed<br />yesterday in Manhattan re. alleged  breach of Contract etc. Sidney Frank<br />Ltd. - V- Beam re. Michael Collins Irish Whiskey</div></blockquote><br /><br />It's interesting to juxtapose that with the brief Irish Times article today noting that Slane is about to lodge a planning application for their new distillery. The Mountcharles were quite bitter when supply was cut off but they rolled with it and soon they will have their own distillery. I admire them for it.</div>

				<div class="content">With regard to both supplies of Whiskey in the Sidney frank case it is an alleged<br />breach of contract vis a vis some of the Irish based brands which I understand<br />were being supplied without contract on a day to day basis.
