				<div class="content">There's a Glenmorangie tasting being organised by O'Brien's offlicense. August 20th, I think, and there's a very good range there for tasting. It's in the Westbury Hotel.</div>

				<div class="content">Glenmorangie has never appealed to me and I was not overly impressed with their new range either.<br /><br />The 10yo is a bit off for my tastes and it seems to run through their whole Santa Ponza range  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />The range by the way which even though has no age statement is more expensive than the regular 10yo (which is always suspicious to my cynical mind  <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />  ).</div>

You get to taste just about the whole new range. And an Ardbeg. I'll forward you the email I got. <br /><br />I am like Adrian - never too impressed by Glenmorangie, although I'd only really tried the 10. I have heard very good things about the new range, though.</div>

				<div class="content">I tried most of the range last October at the Whisky Live in Glasgow.<br />As I recall, I did find the Signet really interesting (the choco malt one), but then nearly had kittens when I saw what they're charging for it. Let's face it, Bush has a malt experiment whiskey out too, a special 400th anniversary edition, in  expensive packaging, and it's no more than half the price.<br />Quinta Ruban is nice too, but I'm a fan of port finishes. Others may not agree.</div>

The 400th It is basically a single malt anyway.</div>

				<div class="content">I would not mind giving them another go in a more relaxed atmosphere but alas I'll not make it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />   Whisky live is probably not the best situation to base my opinions on the finishes. And even though I still don't get the 10yo maybe it is unfair to judge the others after 20 whiskies prior I suppose  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  . <br /><br /><br />Anyway have fun guys and it is excellent to see more whiskey and more over Scotch tasting pop up from other sources.<br /><br />Enjoy  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

According to some of the guys above it was selling out fast so you'd better check fairly pronto.<br /><br /><br />Welcome to the forum by the way  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">We had Glemnorangies Original, Quinta Ruban, Lasanta, Nectar D'Or, 18yo and Ardbeg 10.<br /><br />The Ardbeg 10yo you can keep. It's not overwhelmed by peat, unlike other whiskies I've tried, but still, it's not for me.<br /><br />The Glenmorangies were quite drinkable and mostly, as Rachel said, well-balanced. The exception was the Lasanta which tasted rather too much like sherry, I reckon. My favourite of the night was the 18yo.<br /><br />I'm still hunting for a Scottish malt that I'd actually buy though (I've had some that really appealed to me like Bowmore 25yo and Glenglassaugh 21yo but they are priced above my threshold).<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">This Post has been edited and Hi-Jacked by Admin</span><br /><br /> 	<img src="http://www.whiskybembel.de/Appl/02.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br /> 	<img src="http://www.whiskybembel.de/E/11.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />on Post no <span style="color: #40BF00"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">2000</span></span><br /><br /><br /> 	<img src="http://www.whiskybembel.de/E/04.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br /> 	<img src="http://www.whiskybembel.de/E/14.gif" alt="Image" /></div>
