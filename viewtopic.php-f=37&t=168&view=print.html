				<div class="content">Be Nice to remember Gerard McDonnell also the Limerick climber who died on K2 last Year.<br /><br />On the 1st of August Gerard McDonnell was the first Irish man to summit K2 which is probably the most notorious mountain on earth. Unfortunately it was to prove so this time too and turned into the worst disaster ever on the mountain. I followed this quite closely at the time. Seemingly while trying to save less experienced climbers from another team he was taken by a fatal  avalanche on the mountain.<br /><br />May he rest in peace.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.patfalvey.com/viewnews.php?id=43" class="postlink"><img src="http://www.patfalvey.com/news/main_1217936182IMG_0211.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>

				<div class="content">I'd like to add my thanks to Peter for a great evening. Mountains and I are complete strangers but I found the whole talk fascinating. The mechanical process of getting up such a mountain, the superhuman abilities of the Sherpas, camp conditions, Nepalese culture, vignettes about the other climbers on the mountains... It was really so much more than I anticipated.</div>
