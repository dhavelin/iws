To my knowledge Grain Whiskey is distilled using grains other than malted barley although up to 30% barley can be used. All Grain Whiskey/whisky that I know of uses a Column still.  There are lots of hybrid or Holstien still being used lately that can achieved higher yields but I don't know if it can be call Grain Whiskey if they use these. I'm not all that gone on them but that's me. <br /><br />There are lots of changes to regulations lately and hopefully I'll find more detail. <br /><br />I always thought it couldn't be call Irish Pot Still if it was made of grains other than Barely/malt but it can contain up to 5% other cereals.  I know most Americans Whiskeys use grains other than Barley but don't call themselves grain whiskey regardless of the stills used. <br />I'll have to check into it a little more.</div>

This is a very new requirement, detailed in the Irish Whiskey Technical File. I covered this recently in a blog post:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.liquidirish.com/2015/03/irish-whiskey-technical-file-part-1.html">http://www.liquidirish.com/2015/03/iris ... art-1.html</a><!-- m --></div>
