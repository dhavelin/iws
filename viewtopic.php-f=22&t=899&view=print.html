				<div class="content">That has to be a joke. An English shop's own-brand 8yo is the best Irish Whiskey available??! <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  Utter drivel and a terrible insult to the excellent quality Irish brands out there; from single malts and PPS labels to blends. I can't help but think it would be a cold day in hell before the author ever ranked a Scotch product in the same vane <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />Whisky Bible?

				<div class="content">I suppose we really should hold fire on this until we've tasted the thing. I wonder what score it got?<br /><br />It may not necessarily be the highest scoring Irish in the book - as I understand it the awards in this book usually relate to either an ongoing release that's been retasted or, in the case of limited editions, whiskeys that are released in that year. So, in fairness, a lot of the excellent single cask whiskeys from Cooley would not be eligible. I know there are some recent Sherry cask connemaras but as far as I can gather JM is not usually a fan of mixing sherry and peat. Likewise the 2007 JRVR would not be elibible as it's a 2007/8 release. The recent Redbreast 15yo bottlings would be but he only rated the earlier one at 94 (I think!). <br /><br />We have to remember this is one man's preference and he's often expressed a liking for 8yo whiskeys (mainly Islays I admit). Also if this was an own label Cooley 8yo as opposed to a supermarket label would we be so shocked?? If he'd picked a certain 9yo Cooley last year,that was selected by some people not employed by cooley, I think some of us would have been very pleased. So it's entirely possible that, from the point of view of someone who likes whiskeys at this age, that Sainsburys bought some excellent casks.<br /><br />For be it from me to defend JM, and i think it's highly unlikely that I would pick this bottling based on all the other good stuff out there, but we have to understand these things for what they are. <br /><br />Plus is an 8yo Malt any more shocking as Irish whiskey of the year than a mass produced 7-8 yr old 50:50 grain / potstill blend as was picked a few years ago??</div>
