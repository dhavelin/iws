				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />I am new to this so I would like to thank you in advance for and help you can give me regarding the following query.<br /><br />A friend of mine was given a very very old bottle of Midleton Whiskey as a gift. He has looked into finding what year it was distilled and is looking for a rough valuation. It has been sitting on a top shelf of a pub for al least 35 years.He brought is to Irish Distillers who are very interested in buying it from him but as it is a gift, this is not something that he is interested in selling. Irish Distillers would not put a value on it. Would anyone out there be able to shed some light on this. <br /><br /><br />Again, Thanking you in advance.<br /><br />Mike.</div>

				<div class="content">These were release in the early 70's and possibly the pre-cursor to today's Midleton VR which is released anually.<br /><br />I'm surprised at the IDL offer as I know they have versions of this now ... when was this offer made?<br /><br />Up to 3 years ago these were as rare as hens teeth however these are more common that they used to be now. At their height you may have got 3-400Euro but that would have been for a good example, now not sure of value. However your example the label is in very poor condition thus possibly only worth â‚¬100-150.<br /><br />Here is a pic of a better example I used to own.<br /><br /><a href="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Midleton/MidletonReserve.jpg" class="postlink">Midleton Reserve 107-1</a></div>

A pity as your friend may have been able to make a killing at the time <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />.</div>
