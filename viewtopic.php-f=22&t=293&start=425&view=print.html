The 1st two are definitely related, but markedly different. I prefer the 1st, iirc JohnM preferred the 2nd.</div>

				<div class="content">Very nice Adrian, i really like the Jameson Distiller`s Selection. Every time i open a bottle i am surprised again.<br /><br />My opinion is that it is very spicy by opening a new bottle. With the time the bottle is open it get`s smoother and smoother.<br /><br />Knappogue 16 y.o. is on it`s way  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Enjoy</div>

However I decided just to get 2 Powers 12yo John's Lane in the end.
