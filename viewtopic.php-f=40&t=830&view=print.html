The buildings on the right were the remains of the distillery buildings on the other side of Forbes lane that were connected to the main buildings by enclosed walkway. ( Keith's Mineral water company may have occupied these buildings during the 1920's) There was a cooperage business here for many years.<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

It was connected by walkway/bridge and the outline of where the walkway had been ,can be seen in the brickwork .This building was sold to W.D &amp; H.O. Wills in 1923 by the Dublin Distillers Co. Lt. and was their headquarters for many years until they moved to the south circular road.<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

		</div><br />To me the most important piece is the section of building to the right of the gate .it is the remaining facade of the old office building fronting Marrowbone lane and played an important roll in monitoring the daily activities of the distillery and was crucial to the garrison of 1916. Although the gate has disappeared the office facade still exists although not given recognition of its importance . It is covered in defacing signage and in a poor state. A plaque commemoration the 1916 garrison  was recently unveiled on the canal side stump of wall . I can only surmise that it was placed where it was ,because the most obvious place to put it was would be too much of an embarrassment. I will come back to this later.<br /><br />TBC.............................</div>

		</div><br /><br />A slightly fanciful and not quite Accurate  drawing of the area from &quot;The Illustrated London News &quot; of 1846. Here we can see the canal , City Basin and the harbour  all now filled in with the Luas running on its bed. The old workhouse is to the left , now replaced by St.James hospital .The George Roe distillery windmill is in the top right of the picture sans sails.Royal Hospital  Kilmainham in the top of picture . The old St. James church is visible behind a row of houses to left of the Roe windmill. This was rebuilt into its present form(Alltech) in 1859. Missing from the drawing is ,the curved canal harbour building which was built in 1863 and of course the large Guinness buildings ,the malthouse built in 1885 and the storehouse built in 1902. The distillery chimneys are evident at the curve of the canal.<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Just to finish . Whenever The Marrow bone lane distillery is referred to it is usually illustrated by the remains of the walls on Forbes lane. To my mind the most important remains are ignored . This as I implied in previous post is the facade of the office that flanked the main entrance gate on Marrowbone Lane . It is still there albeit covered in very poor signage which destroys the look and with badly bricked up windows. <br />The first photo is an enlarged piece of the old engraving of the distillery showing the office..<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

		</div><br />In the working life of the distillery this little office would have overseen the comings and goings of the distillery and its importance during the 1916 rising is apparent from the testimonies of the men and women who served there.<br />Check out the witness statement of two of the garrison here........<br />Robert Holland.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0280.pdf">http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/r ...

Ideally the plaque now on the small section of wall in front of the modern telephone exchange would find a better home here and perhaps interpretive panels could be affixed to the window spaces. <br />Wish me luck!</div>
