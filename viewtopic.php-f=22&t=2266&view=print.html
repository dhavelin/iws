				<div class="content">A distillery could easily put out a 21yo in that price bracket and still make a reasonable profit.<br /><br />Point in being the 21yo Cadenheads from Cooley which was released last year for circa 67 sterling.<br /><br />I'd imagine max wholesale prices on a bottle of 21year whiskey should be no more than 50Euro which would include excise, production, storage, basic bottling, staffing costs etc.<br /><br />Even fancy bottles should not up the price than much unless radically customised. <br /><br />Packaging and Marketing and worst of all the dreaded premiumisation is where the prices rocket.<br /><br /><br />There is a massive gap in the market where a Distillery with an excellent product are willing to go the long haul and build a reputation base on a reasonable priced range and grow from there.<br /><br />In my eyes many of the multitude of new start ups hoping to cash in on the Premium market the majority will struggle. Luckily the Teeling Whiskey Co has a bit of prior knowledge and are in the here and now so can take advantage of the current market but what the market will be like in 4-5 years time will not have changed very much in the preception of Irish Whiskey.<br /><br />I could be very wrong but I fear at least half will go out of business with in 10 years if premiumisation is their sole business model.</div>

Some of the start ups seem to be a situation of Celtic Tiger 2 -- Whiskey/Beer is the next big thing <br />and I need to get in quick !! It does seem to be a case of get rich quick . My Latin teacher's favourite quote was ' Festina Lente' <br />-- 'Make haste slowly. Forget about this premium and super premium -- Just make a good whiskey &amp; get the Whiskey writers <br />talking ---- the rest will follow <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>
