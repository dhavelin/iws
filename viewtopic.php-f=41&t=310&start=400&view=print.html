				<div class="content">Has anyone noticed the disparity with the Irish whiskies over 20yrs.old on<br />Whisky Auction ???? This new auction only started Sunday and already the <br />ones in this category are in three figure territory --- literally all of them !!<br />Whiskies in this category are then ending up at 350 euros plus ------ why for<br />God's sake as they are all double distilled Cooleys albeit 23 or 24 yrs. old !!!<br />Anyone out there got an explanation ????? This is a trend for a while!</div>

				<div class="content">This has been happening for well over a year... any Irish Single malts over 20years seem to all be doing very well going for good premiums.<br /><br />These are all mainly European independent Single cask releases too which sell out immediately on release but I've even seen the +20 year Cadenheads Cooley which was only released a couple years back recently going for good money too..<br /><br />However, they seem to be of a very high quality with very positive review with even Serge giving a few very favorable reviews which tends to be listened to by his faithful followers.<br /><br />Check out <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.whiskyfun.com/">http://www.whiskyfun.com/</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">i am still buying a few bottles these days got some Midletons, Jameson 18-s, Jameson Black barrels, and there is a fair amount of good stuff came up on different auction sites, perhaps whiskyauctioneer.com had 130 or so, whisky-online, and whiskyauction.com had nearly a 100 in their past few auctions in recent months.<br /><br />apart from the few crazy price (like Jameson 12 for£680+fees  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> and a month later for 90 and 66+  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ), most of them are coming at reasonable prices.<br /><br />do people getting rid of their stocks do to rising prices, or was it just people wanted money for xmas?<br /><br />just looked back at what some collectible bottles made in the past few years, it is  clear, that prices are going up, but not rocketing, like new whiskey prices; see Midleton 2017 for 170, but a few years ago they were only 110, Redbreast 12 was 30-now 60, just to point out a few..<br /><br />how did everyone else feels about it?<br /><br />are yous buying on auctions still?</div>

				<div class="content">I've sold a few in the past couple of years. I've been lucky for the most part too. Some Scottish stuff let me down but nearly all the Irish stuff performed well. <br /><br />I've been tempted too pick up a few that I think are good value, like a millennium edition Power's 12 the other day for £35 or something like that. That's a bargain anytime. <br /><br />I'm amazed at the amount of stuff up for auction. Remember a few years ago and we were probably all bidding against each other for a couple of dozen bottles.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Raven,    I saw that Paddy bottle on EBay.... we don't call them decanters in the US,    my guess is someone trying to be fancy with his description.  I've been watching the European auctions sites as well for Irish and the options have been pretty nice.  There are no great whiskey auction sites in the US( the few I've found have very little Irish offered).</div>
