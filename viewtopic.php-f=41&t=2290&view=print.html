				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">I am new to this board and from the Southeastern US in Savannah, Georgia.    <br /><br />I am a BIG fan of Midleton's, Red Breast, and Jameson among others.  I also enjoy many bourbons and gins.<br /><br />I wanted the advice and opinions of the members of this board as to web dealers and if any are located in the US. I have seen a few websites where older and rarer bottles are offered, such as the Whisky Exchange and Celtic Whiskey Shop, with shipping at 30-50 per bottle.<br /><br />Many thanx to all in advance!</span></div>

				<div class="content">Hi Stonesstine,<br /><br />There are many retailers in the US that do have a half decent selection of irish Whiskey but probably none on the scale of Celtic Whiskey Shop and The Whiskey Exchange which are possibly 2 of the best.<br /><br />However the sale of alcohol in the States is very hard for us over here to determin as it seems a lot of states prohibit the sale of acohol beyond it's borders. Also very few send internationally so we would not be overly aware of who's who over there, seems like a bit of a mine field to be honest.<br /><br />I know of Binneys in IL who usually have a fair selection but whether they deliver to your area I could not tell. However I have come across many independent online retailers in my searches of old.<br /><br />So best bet is do general searches for Redbreast etc and see what you can come up with.<br /><br />Also look out for Writers tears and the Irishman blends. Not bad for the price and both potstill based.</div>
