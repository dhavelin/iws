				<div class="content">As you have probably noticed IDL have turned their attention towards Powers. In the last few years Redbreast and Powers have had a few extra additions. <br /><br />Powers has always been considered a more traditional style and less civilised than Jameson and therefore not as easy to sell to the uninitiated. <br />Lots of enthusiasts have been calling for a non chilled filter Standard Whiskey. We've got Powers NAS blend being released as a NCF blend. <br />We also wanted a reasonably priced NAS Pot Still at an affordable price but their Powers Signature Reserve hasn't filled this gap. They're now releasing a new addition to the range, the Three Swallows. This should be very close to an older style of Powers. <br /><br />I believe this was what I wished for when I blew out the candles on my birthday cake. Next up a date with Megan Fox and a bottle of Midleton Peril.</div>

				<div class="content">If this nas SPS does indeed go for €40 I will be very pleased but I am getting very cynical about pricing and in all honesty would be skeptical that it would actually happen.<br /><br />I'm actually quite confused here ...<br /><br />Is that not what the The Powers Signature Release was supposed to be? Or are they going to phase out the 12yo???? Which would mean they will place it in the €45-50 bracket I'd say,.<br /><br />The Signature Release has crept up in price like everything else and is now more expensive than the Powers 12yo, that was supposed to be released around the €40 mark too  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> .<br /><br />So currently we have<br /><br />Powers Gold Label Blend  (€27-30)<br />Powers 12yo Blend (Circa €47-50)<br />Powers Signature Release sps (circa €55)<br />Powers John's Lane Reserve 12yo sps (Circa €62-67)<br /><br /><br />Any pictures yet?</div>
