The addition of water is highly recommended to knock off the alcohol hit from the 71.3% abv of the 2011 bottling, but you don't need to add too much.  The flavours hold well.  The Old Potrero has now released a batch that is around 52% (I believe), down from the 60%+ bottle that I have.  It definitely fits in the 'unique' whiskey experience.  If you like rye whiskies, you should love this one, but get a sample first if you can.<br /><br />As for this thread, I picked up a Buffalo Trace (45% abv) at the LCBO here in Ontario this past weekend for $5 off the usual price!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">To detail further, the 2011 Stagg has beautiful notes of fresh pipe tobacco, leather, and polished wood (yeah, I thought 'polished wood...what the???' as well, but it's there (I think of oak) and it works!) that are highlighted with the addition of water (experiment on the water level to find what works for you...I added about a teaspoon to about 40 mL of spirit).  Probably the most 'luxurious' bourbon that I have had in my albeit limited (about 18 months total) whiskey 'career'.</div>

The Weller uses wheat as its' primary flavouring grain in the mashbill, while Stagg has rye as its main flavouring component.  Wheat is definitely a 'softer' grain.  Maker's Mark (&amp; MM46), Parker's Heritage Collection (4th edition) and Old Weller Antique 107 are a couple other wheated bourbons. Unfortunately, I have only read about the joys of the William Larue Weller...I have yet to try a taste of it...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">I was given a bottle of George Dickel #12 by a friend of mine yesterday as a thank you for looking after the &quot;wildlife&quot; (three cats, seven gerbils, two fish) at his house for the last week.  He knew I had been itching to get a bottle so the gesture is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />For those not familiar with George Dickel, it is the only other widely available Tennessee whisky (their spelling - by design) out there, other than the omnipresent Jack Daniels.  If you are not a fan of JD, do NOT let that experience colour your attitude towards the Tennessee whisky style!  Dickel #12 is simply awesome, very &quot;sippable&quot;, whisky!  Quite enjoyable on a warm summer day, with very nice, sweet, toffee and maple notes that do not overpower to a cloying level of sweetness.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
