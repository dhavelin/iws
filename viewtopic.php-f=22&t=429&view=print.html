				<div class="content">I'm curious to know what others make of this. I bought a bottle about 4 years ago, had one measure, wasn't mad on it and didn't touch it again until about a month ago. I don't know why I tried it again but I really liked it. It's been a semi regular drink over the last few weeks.<br /><br />It's a bit of an odd one out in the cooley malts range - there's many different tyrconnell and connemara expressions with a core NAS bottling. This has just one - and with an age statement. <br /><br />I know there's meant to be a little bit of peat in this compared to the tyrconnell but i get little, if any. <br /><br />Anyway, I'm having one now so I thought I'd ask what y'all think.</div>

				<div class="content">I like it a lot and have a kind of sentemental attachment to it from years and years ago - it was one of the first Cooleys I bought. I haven't had it in a long time, though. I'll have to pick up a bottle. I've had the Michael Collins recently, which is a similar formula, and like that one.</div>

Me too which I think was just an unaged version first then they built up 8 years and stuck the 8yo tag on it from then on.<br /><br />I currently hav a bottle open and find it a lovely malt with just a touch of peat which I don't always get as it depends on form I think.</div>
