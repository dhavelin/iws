				<div class="content">Nestled in the picture postcard village of Clashmore in West Waterford ( 7 miles from Youghal) this Distillery<br />once produced 20,000 gallons a year. Established by the 12th. Earl of Huntingdon, Lord Hastings. It operated <br />from 1835 to 1840 and was operated for him by the Dennehy family of Laurentum House. As was almost customary <br />at the time an illicit store of whiskey produced to evade excise tax was secretly stored in the cellar of an adjoining <br />house. The 'Gaugers and the Excise men' ( like the song says) raided constantly and finding the store on one occasion <br />released the casks into the adjoining Greagagh river. The cattle that drank from the river downstream that day were <br />drunk so the local legend says anyway. It is unique in Ireland in that it is the only Distillery in Ireland where the Chimney<br /> bridged the river (Greagagh) which supplied the Distillery.</div>
