				<div class="content">similarly sad to see W.J. Kavanaghs close. They were much closer to me than stoneybatter and an absolutely class act of a pub. They also did a whole lot of work for craft brewing and distilling in this country. I hear the staff have all been retained so, like willie says, i'm hoping they still have something up their sleeves</div>
