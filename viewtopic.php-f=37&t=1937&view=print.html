				<div class="content">Become a Master Whiskey Blender!<br /><br />Have you ever 'freshened' up a tired dram with a wee drop of something else? Do you sometimes like to mix and match the spirits in your glass? Have you ever wondered how the professional whiskey blenders create their masterpieces? The Irish Whiskey Society is offering you a unique opportunity to be a whiskey blender for a night. With hands-on guidance from renowned Master Blender Alex Chasko, you will have the opportunity to create your own custom blend from a range of exclusive and excellent Irish whiskey components.<br /><br />Alex, formerly innovation manager at Cooley Whiskey, is responsible for some of the most innovative Irish whiskeys of the past ten years, including the world-renowned Connemara Bog Oak Irish Single Malt and Cooley's single potstill poitin.<br /><br />But that's not all. Following the enormous success of our first ever official bottling last year, the Irish Whiskey Society is about to commission its next unique dram. And we want YOU the members to choose what it is! The Teeling Whiskey Company's Master Blender Alex Chasko has personally designed not one but four unique custom-blended Irish whiskeys for the society to choose from, and we will pick one of them to bottle on the night!<br /><br />So if you'd like to enjoy a very different type of whiskey tasting, where you get to choose the Irish Whiskey Society's next exclusive bottling AND try your hand at whiskey blending under the guidance of a master, sign up today from the booking page.  This will take place in Brooks Hotel on Wednesday 5th June.</div>
