				<div class="content">Your probably right there ... you see alot on at £300 but don't even sell. Problem is that nobody seems to want to open theirs in the hope it will appreciate. These bottles ofcourse did appreciate for a good few years but have drastically fallen back. Also most collectors now own one of these bottles so there is no major demand for them. Just an unfortunate state of affairs for people trying to flog them. I would suggest putting it on ebay with a reserve and see how you get on. Even if it does not reach the reserve you might be happy to let it go at the end price.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there IWC, I'd agree most collectors have a couple of bottles by now. Also despite it's age, as you say a lot of these were kept and not opened by their owners.<br /><br />It was launched in 1983 with remaining stock in bond purchased by James McCabe, Spirit Merchants, Portadown. They vatted together all the remaining stocks that they could lay their hands on and the process ended up yielding about 5,000 bottles of Old Comber. They were on sale for 10-15 years as it took that long to shift the entire stock at the prices they set.</div>

The distillery is built within an old US Navy aviation building in Alameda.  You can see the San Francisco Bay Bridge from the distillery; they give tours and have a small bar to sample their wares.  I went there in winter of 2008 and had a good time.  Of course someone else was driving ....   <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />There is a good whiskey store in downtown San Francisco called Cask that features some very nice Irish whiskeys (for the States, that is).  I bought a bottle of Tullamore Dew Heritage Reserve (70 cl) there in May and my sister bought me a bottle of Millar's (70 cl) from the same store.  It's a small but well apportioned store.</div>
