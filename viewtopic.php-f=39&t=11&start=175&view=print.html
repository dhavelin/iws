				<div class="content">Hi to all, <br />My name is Willie Murphy.I come from that sunniest of counties in the  south-east,Wexford. I am impressed with the vast knowledge and expertise on this forum.Thank to the Irish Whiskey Chaser for suggesting i should use it to gain more information.<br />I've started collecting Whiskey in the last couple of years. <br />I lived in Germany years ago and was introduced to whiskey there.The Germans are fond of it.the variety was amazing.<br />Sadly we don't market our finer products here.I became a fan of Jameson Gold,which could not be bought here until a couple of years ago.<br />At that time i liked both Irish &amp; Scotch(Islay especially) Could not really shine to the Americans.Although the people are grand.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br />It only since i gave up smoking(about 5 years &amp; 4 stone ago) that I've really started to indulge.From then i have realized that we do indeed produce the finest whiskeys in the world.<br />I work in a pub in Wexford town.It is really sad to say but the Irish Pub is not a place to get the real good Irish whiskey.We only stock the basics.<br />There are a few pubs that do have some nice ones but for the main part most don't.<br />I look forward to reading and perhaps contributing to the knowledge bestowed here.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello to all members, my name is Aiden McCabe and I am really looking forward to learning how to better appreciate whiskey.<br />I had my first sip of whiskey at age 12 and it was one I sneaked off a table during a family event, it was also my last for another 10 years. I still remember the burn as it passed down my throat and the resulting mess I made all over the table as I threw-up. A hard lesson for a young boy and one that I have never forgotten.<br />Three years later and I start onboard the M.V. Munster as a galley boy and have a direct introduction to some of the hardest drinking men I have ever seen. These men had sailed all over the world and had experience of some the strongest drink available and because of that were well able to have a drink and work their next watch. It showed me how to take responsibility for myself and the way I treated drink. Over the next 33 years onboard ships and ashore I only drank whiskey for pleasure and anytime I have gotten drunk it was mostly from beer. For years before the ships went dry I would have a bottle of Irish ( Black Bush or Crested Ten) or Scotch in my locker and would have a single glass before turning in after a 12/13 hour watch. <br />I now collect and drink whiskey for pleasure and still drink beer. So nothing has really changed except I now have a deeper appreciation for whiskey, its history and the process it has to go through to be called whiskey. My own preference now is for single malts such as the Bushmills 16year old but I have a growing appreciation for blended whiskey like the Redbreast 12yo and some of the Japanese blends like the Hibiki 17 or 21yo.<br />I am not in anyway an expert or very knowledgeable about whiskey but would hope to learn from this forum and the increasing number of whiskey enthusiasts that now share their expertise and knowledge.  <br />regards,<br />Aiden McCabe.</div>

				<div class="content">Great intro, Aiden! Welcome to the forum, aaargh! I look forward to hearing more pirate tales of the high seas.<br /><br />Just a small point: Redbreast is not a blend but the Irish equivalent of a &quot;single malt&quot;, namely a &quot;single pot still&quot;. Just like a malt, it is entirely made in big copper pot stills. The difference is the use of both unmalted and malted barley.</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>TheWhiskeyBro</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I suppose the best way to describe Redbreast is that it uses a single 'mashbill' of malted and unmalted (green) barley which gives some lovely spice.<br /><br />Commonly misunderstood by many, especially our scottish cousins.<br /><br />Your very welcome Aiden, did I see you were down to go to the Bow Street tasting?<br /><br />The next events are Whisky Live 14th May (fantastic discount for our members) and American Rye tasting Thursday 26th in Brooks Hotel (booking available shortly)</div>

				<div class="content">My name is Ken, I live in Bourbon country ( Central Kentucky ). I had always been a stout and ale drinker, but decided to find a spirit I could sit back and relax with. I detest bourbon, american whiskey's, tequila and most rums. I decided to try Scotch ( my first being Famous Grouse), I enjoyed it quite a bit. I eventually moved on to some single malts, then could not go back to blends. Single malts priced what they are cut into my wallet a bit. I decided to try what you might call entry level Irish Whiskey's. Enjoying the vanilla, and caramel tones of some of these brands, I found myself an alternative to go between my single malts with. I have tried many of the brands available to my area of the country. I tend keep either a bottle of Powers or Feckin on hand. There you go guys, that's me.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ken! I hope you find a few more Irish whiskeys from this forum to alternate with your Scotch. I suggest Writers Tears as a flavourful, reasonably-priced whiskey. Should be available in the US. I also sampled Tullamore Dew 12yo recently and was impressed.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Everybody,<br /><br />I live in the Western US, and i am here because I enjoy Irish Whiskey.  My range of experience is not exhaustive.  I generally drink Bushmills &quot;Black Bush&quot;.  I have tried and enjoyed Red Breast 15 Year, Bushmills 1608. <br /><br />By far, my favorite is the dram of Bushmills 21 Year Old which my friend bought me a couple weeks ago.  I will read the section on creating tasting notes before I try to describe this most excellent Whiskey!<br /><br />I look forward to getting to know you, and learning more about the admirable Whiskeys of Ireland!<br /><br />And I promise, I'll get around to trying Jameson too!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />/BB</div>

We all taste differently so we will all get different aspects and profiles to the same whiskey which is one of the wonderful quirky delights of tasting whiskey.</div>

Where as a lot of the Jamesons are more based on sherry casks and have a good deal of Pot Still as well as grain whiskey which is a different style.</div>
