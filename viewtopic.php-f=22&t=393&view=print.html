JohnM let me know if you know where to some as I want to buy 2 or 3 pronto. People are saying they are expensive @ Â£85 (Circa 100Euro) but I've been buying some Maxxim 35cl single cask HP's for 60Euro a pop so that would equate to 120Euro for a full bottle. SO not too bad. I really like HP around this age at Csak Strength  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>
