				<div class="content">does anyone know any good sippin' rums?  thinking about making the transition for the &quot;warmer&quot; months.  i know a fair bit about rum.  how its made, types, colors, etc....  unfortunately i have not tried that many different types.  rum was always a college drink for me.  mix with some coke and try to get as drunk as possible.  with learning a lot about whisky/whiskey over the last few years, ive decided to branch out to other spirits.  i have always heard that mount gay and appleton estate make fantastic sippin rums.  if anyone can offer some advice, id appreciate it.  also, its driving me nuts...what is the rum you see all the time in pubs here?  not bacardi white...the dark one with the black label.  cant thin of it and its driving me nuts.  <br /><br />gotta make room for my awesome pirate joke.  a pirate walks into a bar and says &quot;arghh maytee.  gimme a rum on the rocks.&quot;  bartender says &quot;sure thing sir.  but do you know you have a steering wheel stuck to your pants?&quot;  pirate says &quot;arrghhhh i know.  its driving me nuts!&quot;  <br /><br />wow, i just realized how bad that was, lol</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Brettie,<br /><br />Personally I prefer Ron Zacapa - the Centenario XO by choice <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> , though the standard expression is also very nice to sip. It is a Guatemalan rum with a fantastic pedigree and has won countless awards for its quality.<br /><br />It can be difficult to get hold of but worth the effort in my humble opinion!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">thanks guys.  i will look into these rums.  its sad, but my experience with rum is only with standards to sub-pars.  i like to give everything a chance and branch out to learn more.  although, i dont think i will be giving vodka a chance.  i find it to be nauseating, but thats just my opinion.  would be nice to get into some nice gins too.  always liked the gin and tonics and martinis.  now im really getting off topic, hahahah</div>
