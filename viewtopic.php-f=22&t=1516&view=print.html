				<div class="content">A tasting night for The Whiskey Exchange - a cask was picked at the end of the night for exclusive bottling   <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br /><a href="http://blog.thewhiskyexchange.com/2012/03/tasting-the-single-pot-still-range-with-barry-crockett/" class="postlink">http://blog.thewhiskyexchange.com/2012/03/tasting-the-single-pot-still-range-with-barry-crockett/</a><br /><br />True to form, the crowd seems to pick the worst one   <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />We'll have to keep our eyes peeled for this.  Come to think of it, could we put the hammer on IDL for something similar?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /><br /><br />Comments/thoughts please!   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_ugeek.gif" alt=":ugeek:" title="Uber Geek" /></div>

				<div class="content">IDL seem to be pushing out quite a few single casks these days which is great to see. So it looks like it may become an important part of the Single Pot Still push. <br /><br />However we could have a major issue shifting a full cask which could be quite difficult especially if it is an expensive bottling and when the outlay would more than lightly be quite considerable for a fully matured SPS. So there may be a lot to consider before we go that route.<br /><br />However never say never ...</div>

				<div class="content">I think it'd be a great idea. CWS has had 3 or 4 bottlings so far i believe. 200 bottles at €200 retail. I'd assume there is a good mark up because it's exclusive.<br />I can see there being no problem recouping initial investment but I'm prone to being impulsive. After reading the tasting notes I've decided to open a bottle of Barry Crockett legacy. <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Yes it would be great but we have to be very cautious when it comes to full casks. Our first cask it has to be remembered was only a partial cask which sold well at a €60 price point (€10 extra for a box). However we went for a second partial cask the same year and it struggled. Then we had another similar partial cask the following year and again it did not sell out straight away. So some of us will go the whole hog with out a thought but not necessarily the majority and that is what we need to be mind full of. So over a 2 year period we have only sold 200-250 bottles. That is the equivalent of a full cask ans add a premium to that and you may find that it is much slower to shift.</div>

However as we grow hopefully we can over come these difficulties and we constantly have people in the back ground trying to figure out ways but it's all a matter of being patient.</div>
