				<div class="content">1000 Years of Irish -Whiskey Malachy Magee --O'Brien Press<br />This is the first one that i am reading-- it told  me about the practices of some  business folks<br /> of mixing plain alcohol with irish whiskey and selling it  cheap as 100 percent real stuff<br />The coffe still was a very efficient alcohol producer invented  by an irishman. it almost caused <br />the demise of real irish whiskey production.<br />I also learned that a friend of  mine named  william Coffee  is irish. I just thought it was<br /> an odd last name. I'm enjoying the education.</div>

				<div class="content">Quite an unknown fact actually that the drink Coffee is named after it's Irish inventor.<br /><br />Originally made from degreasing axels with boiling hot water. It is thpought Coffee began the tradition of using the hot mix to keep thimself warm, thus named after it's first known imbiber and due to the reason that this guy called Coffee made it popular the name stuck and ironically it made people cough too.<br /><br />Was then taken a step further when his son Coffee jr emigrated to south america during the great famine and was trecking through south america when he came upon a local tribe and they were brewing this mirical drink. After tasting it he jumped up as stated ... this tastes like coffee.<br /><br />This new form of coffee was easier to produce and took over after the fall of the industrial revolution as there was not as many axels around to be degreased. <br /><br />Always slightly on the unpalatable side for most Irish people they began the practice of adding Irish Whiskey and it was christened Irish Coffee so that the scots could not lay a claim to that either.<br /><br />and that is the truth to be sure ....<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br /><br />Of course the the Coffee family were known for their Blarney also  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />But it is a well known name in Ireland.</div>

				<div class="content">A family named Coffey (with a Y) lived nearby. Funny thing, they were constantly kidded about the name, and not one of them would drink the stuff. They loved tea, and soda, and anything else except coffee.</div>

				<div class="content">I am reporting on this  book because it is a  history lesson for  me. opression--taxation without representation, deprivation of opportunity to advance ones self  and  much  more..  it should be required reading for folks in the USA. well im half through only because i  just read a few pages when i lay down at night. But i cant put it aside. ((I NEVER ENJOY READING ANYTHING EXCEPT TEXT AND TEACHING  BOOKS.))<br /><br />Surely someone somewhere has  made a  movie on this subject. The truth is  most fascinating. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /> I also learned that a  fellow named D'Arcey was irish too.. i never associated coffey  or this name as irish.<br /> O'hanlon--Kelly--Ennis- O'riley and such  are what i was used to hearing.<br />  I guess i am becoming fascinated with the Emrald Isle.</div>
