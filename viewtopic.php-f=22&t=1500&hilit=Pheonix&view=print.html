				<div class="content">Hi folks I am new to the site.<br />I am researching the possibility of establishing a single malt Irish whiskey distillery on the west coast of Ireland.<br />I have my site located and am in discussions to  commission the legally required copper 1800 L copper pot still.<br />I will be seeking to to recruit the services of an experienced distiller and the role would ideally suit a retired individual who could be persuaded to come out of retirement! If anyone out there is interested or perhaps knows someone who may fit the bill, please assist. Thank you all.<br /><br />Les</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Lezlie<br /><br />That's great news. I'd say there aren't many retired distillers in Ireland, so Scotland might be the place to look. I know John McDougall did some consultancy work for the Dingle project. He might be someone to approach or he might be able to point you in the right direction - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.johncmcdougall.com/">http://www.johncmcdougall.com/</a><!-- m -->. He has an impressive list of distilleries under his belt.</div>

				<div class="content">I was speaking to some people from Kilkenny about the Smitwickes brewery closing there. I was thinking that if would not be a bad idea to turn the brewery into a distillary. Just add pot stills and most everything else is in place. <br />With the future of Irish Whiskey looking bright this could a winner. <br />The old <span class="posthilit">pheonix</span> brewery in Waterford could also be converted. Great name too. <br />Are these the rantings of a mad man or am I onto a good idea?</div>
