				<div class="content">Some notes...<br /><br />Midleton Visitor centre opened in 1992, now gets about 100,000 visitors per year.<br /><br />Morehead said Midleton is the &quot;Home of Pure Pot Still&quot;. [We know that's the case but it's great to hear them push that in public.]<br /><br />IDL sold 0.5m cases of whiskey when Pernod-Ricard took in 1988. Sold over 2.7m last year and hope for 3m this year. Hope for 1m cases in the US alone this year.<br /><br />90% of production is for export, 10% domestic.<br /><br />Powers, Paddy... &quot;still extremely important&quot;. Powers is selling well in the US, Paddy in France... all have a big part to play in the future.<br /><br />Jameson is about 5 years old.<br /><br />Going back to 7 day production in the coming weeks.</div>

				<div class="content">Good overview of how Midleton are progressing on world markets, 2.7 million (cases) in 2009, hope to reach 3 million this year. Breakdown is currently 10% for domestic market, 90% export market, 1 million cases in the US. Paddy as we know popular in France, with Powers gaining popularity in the US. Powers only overtaken recently in Ireland. Pernod Ricard have put â‚¬70m into worldwide marketing. <br /><br />Nice little feature from Peter Moorhouse, Production Manager at Midleton ... will post link to newstalk later.</div>

				<div class="content">Cheers lads nice to hear the synopsis ... <br /><br />Just goes to show how strong the home market is ... 10% of all output is for Domestic market which I think is excellent on such large figures. And the states on 37% which is massive.</div>
