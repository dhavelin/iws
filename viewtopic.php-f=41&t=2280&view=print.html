				<div class="content">Prohibition was 1920-1933 in the US so plenty of scope for a 30's bottling but yes we'd need to see it.<br /><br />here's a script to what you were refering ...<br /><br /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Prohibition_prescription_front.jpg/250px-Prohibition_prescription_front.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Some other clues to look out for ...<br /><br />Irish Free State 1922 -1937 is also handy to remeber as sometimes you see bottles with produced in The Irish Free State. However I don't think Jameson used it as they would have been more in favour of the Commonwealth so the usage of the Brittish Monachy is usefull too as some of their bottlings had by appointment of The King and if your lucky it will mention an actual King. But these are few and far between too.<br /><br />Victoria 1837 – 1901<br />Edward VII 1901 – 1910<br />George V 1910 – 1936<br />Edward VIII 1936  (Abdicated)<br />George VI 1936 -1952<br />Elizebeth II 1952 - present</div>
