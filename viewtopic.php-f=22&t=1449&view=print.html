				<div class="content">Does anyone know who distilled this? I spoke to a gentleman from Edward Dillon's about it and he too was unaware of it's origins. I know it was released for the Japanese market and it is malt,but that's all i know.</div>

				<div class="content">That makes sense John.<br />I believe that Pernod and Dillon's don't exactly see eye to eye. That ruled out Midleton straight away. Pernod still owned Bushmill's at that time too to my knowledge. <br />My powers of deduction have deserted  me lately. Thanks again.</div>

				<div class="content">I asked a Hennessy guy about it once. He said they didn't plan to do it again. Which would imply to me they did it the first time around.<br /><br />That company has a very strong Irish connection (since the original Mr Hennessy was Irish). Perhaps they were looking to commemorate that.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, hennessy commissioned it as an homage to their irish roots. i remember hearing that it was basically just tyrconnell that spent a little extra time in the wood... hardly worth the pricetag now that there are older and probably better selected tyrconnells out there</div>

				<div class="content">I was in the medieval town of Cognac back in the 80's and did the Hennessey tour with my family, it was fantastic, extra special treatment when they found out we were Irish. Hennessey arrived after the flight of the Earls if I can recall correctly, they are very proud of their Irish connection. The warehouse in the middle of a forrest full of maturing casks was something to behold. On the look out for a bottle myself but won't pay more than 200 euro, I could be waiting.....</div>

				<div class="content">They have on  TWE for £199 which can always be negotiated. I agree that €500+ was a mad price to pay. I believe the seller of that one was from Hungary. He also had the 12 year old Midleton( Southern Germany Magazine) and the Midleton 26 year old that went for €1011. I had spoken to him before regarding a bottle of Jameson Distillery Horse which has eluded me for some time now.</div>
