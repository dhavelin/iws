				<div class="content">I stuck a small comment on the website, John. <br /><br />The thing is, some people use the word &quot;blend&quot; like a patronising pat on the back. I wouldn't care if it was a blend, as long as it tastes good. But it's not a blend.<br /><br />I understand, though, that it may be difficult to categorise in such competitions, but it's just not a blend.</div>

				<div class="content">I know what you mean, but unless someone points out the weakness of their grading system the old 'PPS' will never get a foothold - nor will its unique identity be preserved. In fairness though in any competition you need just that - competition, and unfortunately there is practically none out there <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> . I'm still surprised though that an eminent publication like that would fail to recognise the difference.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /></div>

Grain is usually younger, lighter and sweeter and can actually be a benifit but is more often than not used as a filler to make cheaper whiskey. Also a lot of cheap blends can have up to the high 90's in % content of grain whiskey.<br />However the blend should not be sniffed at. There is a huge market for blends as they are not as strong tasting as Malts. Circa 85-90% of all scotch sold in the world is Blended whisky ... conversly it comes across that 85-90% of all talk about scotch is in regards to single malts  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  <br /><br />A Malt blend is a selection of different malts blended together to give a blended malt. Also know as &quot;all malt&quot; or &quot;pure malt&quot;. No grain is present but it cannot be called a single malt as it does not come from a single distillery.<br /><br />I've had Hibiki 17yo which I though was really yummy and really benifited from the grain. Johnny Walker Green is a blended Malt with Talisker as one of it's main constituents. The Red Black and Gold are blends with grain (not sure about blue).</div>
