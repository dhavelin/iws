				<div class="content">Yes, I can confirm that too. I can't believe I had not mentioned it earlier  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> . <br /><br />Shane Fitzharris (Brand Manager) told me they had plans for this at Whisky Live Dublin. But no definite date.<br /><br />As it has been entered in a Competition must mean it is probably bottled and ready to go.</div>

Yes, we shall have a local supplement at the tasting and as a bonus I believe the boys downstairs in the shop will be tasting German beers, that means you have to walk past the beers to get to the whiskey tasting.

				<div class="content">Hi everyone, I guess you all know this one by now and it'S me that's a little behind times, but yesterday I met Shane the Brand Ambassador at FInest Spirits Munich and had a long chat with him about the products.<br /><br />He tells me that Ireland, or is it the Irish Government is doing its usual promotion on Irish whiskey and the typical price over there is around €120, whereas here in Germany we have to suffer with about €75.<br />But then he also assures me that the bottle in the pictures to follow is the last available in Germany  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />But then again I did get the last drops from what was the penultimate bottle in Germany  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />It's good stuff and I'll put my review online in the next couple or so weeks, when I catch up with my rather massive backlog of notes and samples.<br /><br />Meanwhile, for those not lucky enough to see it, here are some pictures which I may have to spread across a couple of posts if I'm not allowed to get them all into here .....<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

I'm still waiting to see the legal definitions the distilleries collectively have been working on for submission to the EU.<br /><br />It's up to IDL, I'm sure, how WT gets to describe itself. Perhaps we should keep an eye on their bottles now that IDL itself has gone big on SPS.<br /><br />As for the distillery origin, we are not allowed to say. It could have &quot;single&quot; on the label though.</div>

It's a pity then, given that cooley have stopped calling &quot;single malts&quot; &quot;pure pot still&quot;, that the cask strength say &quot;Pot Still Whiskey&quot;. Or maybe I'm just being pickey.<br /><br />Another question - I heard some say once they thought this was a 21yo. It tastes much younger to me. Any idea anyone?</div>

Don't want to get Writers Tears into hot water (I don't go for those hot whiskeys) so it's enough to say that it contains an SPS component.<br /><br />Regarding the Cask Strength, I couldn't seem to get my hands on any info.
