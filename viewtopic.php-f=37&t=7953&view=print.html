It would be good for the membership at large to get an insight into the latest developments, launches, openings, etc.<br />Much appreciated,<br />John.</div>

There's going to be changes in the setup for the Forum soon. <br />When the changes are made I'll try get information for all enthusiasts regardless of whether they are Irish Whiskey Society members or no. <br /><br />Sl√°inte <br />Will</div>

				<div class="content">As as past and current member of IWS it should be the job<br />of a PRO to be active if not on the main parts of the forum <br />then at least on the Society part of forum. When you're not able <br />to attend at Dublin tastings then the least you should expect for <br />your membership stipend is  at the very least a bit of information.</div>
