				<div class="content">A question for anyone who's tried a few different casks - is there a wide variation?<br /><br />I was just going to finish off a bottle of cask 310 but was wondering if it's opening one of the others to compare. I don't really want to open one right now but I don't want to leave the dregs at the and of the open one too long either!</div>

They're all the same strength.<br /><br />How many cask of this were produced, do you have any idea?<br /><br />I think I'll proceed with the prime number. That sounds like good advice. If I ever run a distillery I'm going to code all my casks with infinite non recurring decimals. I'll need big labels. Exept for pi.</div>

				<div class="content">£5,000 for the cask, including taxes, I believe. Great value. Some in the U.S. got them for $5,000.</div>

				<div class="content">And a good cash injection for them I guess. About 1.8m?  When were they sold I wonder - as in how far before 2000.

				<div class="content">I can recall as a young lad on my first visit to Bushmill's almost 20 years ago, that the casks were for sale and had been for some time. I think they were on sale for a long time with the price increasing as they approached maturity, I seem to have a figure of £3,000  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />  in my head for the early 1990s. I'm sure it is a question the distillery might be able to answer?</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>There was a good bit of difference between the ones I have an a sample I got from Adrian.</div></blockquote><br /><br />That was one of the worst Irish Whiskey's I've ever tasted. Must go back to it ... but it had a perfumy taste to it which I hated. I've tasted 5 different and some can be quite similar but great and then I open this pup of a whiskey  I suppose i was just unlucky  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  Even at a decent price of 80Euro it was still a bad buy.<br /><br />For anyone that's interested it's cask 127.</div>
