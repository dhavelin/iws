				<div class="content">Now we're getting somewhere ... I like the way you've incorporated the hands of the claddagh. In general I'm in favour but ....<br /><br />I have 2 slight issues ... <br /><br />1. Zoltans crest is good but I am still unsure as it is too similar to the Hungarian one for me. Be nice to have something even slightly different. A few more tweeks may be good.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.iwai.ie/download/IWSlogo.jpg" alt="Image" />  <img src="download/logo2-id=6.jpg" alt="Image" />  <img src="http://whiskyclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/society-logo-150x150.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />2. not being Dublin based I would like to see the Dublin dropped. Maybe we can have <span style="font-style: italic">Eire</span> like on our Coins in a similar text.<br /><br /><br />The claddagh is an excellent idea once incorporated into context of the whiskey society and the potstill as the heart so to speak. I'd be very positive towards that as a centre piece. SO between David Zoltan and Michael we are getting smoewhere<br /><br />Which brings us on to the motto. The hands in the original Claddagh represent friendship. So maybe we could have a motto of Friendship and welcome/hospitality in gaeilge (<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">cairdeas agus fáilte</span></span>) or (<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">fáilte agus cairdeas</span></span>) which every way sounds best or something similar. Kind of fits in with the whole Irish personality &amp; whiskey thing. Maybe a bit wishy washy but might give others something to build on.<br /><br />or in Latin <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">amicitia et hospito</span></span>  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

I know one of our members knows a designer and they may be able to get a good deal on a professional design ... so if anyone else knows of a similarly talented person don't be affraid to put their name forward.

I certainly don't want people thinking that they are a few trying to get their own way all the time but there is very little feed back coming let alone ideas so we are in a quandry here. The main reason I come on here all the time is just to try and keep the momentum going and the discussion alive as I have the time to do so.<br /><br />Remember we have a core of 50 people but only 10 people have partaken in this discussion so what can you do.<br /><br />In saying that nothing on here will be rail roaded through as we do need consensus. I'll re-champion my celtic cross design  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  and no the GAA do not have copy right design to the symbol ...<br /><br />I reckon that we should have several designs and then we as a group vote on it. ANyway a designer may even come up with a totally unique design again so I reckon we will have plenty to play with by the time it comes around to making a decision.<br /><br />Keep the ideas flowing</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think we really need to overly worry about this too much yet. Firstly It is obvious that not everyone is going to agree on the same design and secondly we don't have enough choice for people to choose from. What we probably should do is hand over to a design person/team to come up with a few different ideas incorporating what we have already and possibly coming up with new ideas. Then once we have a selection we can vote on one and after that majority rules. Some people may not like a goblin in the centre of the crest/logo but if majority decides that than that is the way it should be  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>
