				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Distiller wrote:</cite><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think the McCarthy's is very like the single malt made at Kilbeggan.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I just wanted to clear this up before people are confused.  <br /><br />John McCarthy has a very nice distillery in Portland Oregon called Clear Creek (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.clearcreekdistillery.com">http://www.clearcreekdistillery.com</a><!-- m -->).  His family own a fruit orchard and what he would primarily make is Eau-de-Vie from the fruit.  He also makes a Peated Single Malt Whiskey from Scottish peated malt. The single malt is distilled on the same stills as the Eau-de_vie and the wash is made by a local brewery.  I like his whiskey. When I was a young man living in Portland and interested in distilling John was very good to me and my questions.<br /><br />The malt whiskey made in Kilbeggan is non-peated and double distilled in pot still from wash made onsite.  <br /><br />I would not say that one whiskey is better than the other but they are not the same.  Chalk and Cheese in the whiskey world.</div></blockquote><br />Hi Distiller. I did not know this, nor anything about the Distillery that McCarthys was made at. I just tasted the two and thought they were similar. Maybe it is just that they are both single malts and both young spirit. Or it's quite possible that I'm very wrong. I'm the only one I know to make the comparison.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey John<br />You are right that they are young and unique whiskey.  I was just wanted to share my knowledge about the two whiskey and how they are made.  I was not trying to say that you are wrong.  You are correct that they are young single malts.  I like them!  Just wanted to let people know how they are made.</div>

				<div class="content"><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  great story, Aidan!  I have really enjoyed the first couple of drams that I have had from the Spice Tree.  I picked an interesting mineral note that worked really nicely in those first drams.  I haven't had one in a while though, to see how the slightly open bottle has developed.</div>

				<div class="content">Not a purchase, but a surprise &quot;just because&quot; gift from my wonderful wife...Dun Bheagan Islay 8 yo (2002 / 2010).  I tried this at a food and wine show here in London, Ontario in January, not knowing what it was comprised of...it seemed very familiar for some reason...<br /><br />One of my favourite Scotch whiskies is Lagavulin 16.  Sure enough, the representative who poured the sample for me advised that, while not advertised on the bottle, this is indeed Lagavulin 8.  It is basically &quot;Laga 16 Lite&quot; (not as much sherry influence, iirc from January) and something that I will enjoy during the summer months when I want a Lagavulin peat hit that isn't too heavy.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

Is your bottle newly purchased, or have you had it in the cabinet for awhile?  I have loved my bottle of Booker's and have picked up a flavour profile similar to an 'Oh Henry!' chocolate bar (this may only be available in Canada, so my apologies for the potentially obscure reference).  Essentially, I get nice notes of salted/roasted peanuts, caramel, with an underlying note of cocoa/milk chocolate.  I love the straight from the barrel, unfiltered, undiluted nature of the bottling.  Look at the bottom of your bottle for barrel char!  A very cool, &quot;authentic&quot; bottling.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
