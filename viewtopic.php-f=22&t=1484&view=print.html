				<div class="content">...... had an excellent article about Irish Whiskey yesterday. Unlike many articles there facts are pretty spot on. Lots of interesting info on sales, approaches to marketing etc. by IDL, Bushmills, Colley and Grants and some interesting comments from John Teeling. <br /><br />It doesn't seem to be on a web page I can post a link to but if you go onto their site, go to Business and then Innovation, then select 24th Feb (rather than current which is still January for some reason), you can read it on the epaper viewer.<br /><br />Or maybe one of the people here who actually knows what they're doing when the switch a piece of technology on will figure something out.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it may be one of the old dunnage warehouses from Midlteon. They have kept a hand full in that style with some of their oldest whiskey maturing.<br /><br />Another reason I am saying this also is I have a feeling these are mainly sherry butts but I could be totally wrong as your guess is not totally unfounded either. Bunahabhainn would also be known for having sherry butts too so where does that leave my educated guess. Who's had the pleasure of being in the one of the old sheds? Those beams I would have thought are fairly memorable.</div>
