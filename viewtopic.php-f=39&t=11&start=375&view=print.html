				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />I'm a student of cognition science (you definitely need some barrels of whiskey do endure this stuff) and currently do an exchange year in Germany, Stuttgart. My family owns a small whiskey distillery and my father introduced me to it step by step and in young years (not THAT young, but in an age when you normally drink stuff like beer or vodka). I'm missing the whiskey culture down here in this land of beer and hope to find it here.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Welcome to the forum and society. <br /><br />I got my interest in whiskey when I lived in Germany. There was always s better choice of Irish whiskeys there then in most Irish bar in Ireland. <br /><br />Your family are involved in distilling too, that's interesting. Would we be aware of any brands?<br /><br />I wish you well with your studies. If your down in Ulm drop into Mirphy's Law near the bahnhoff. They had some interesting whiskeys the last time I was there. There used to be a whiskey shop near the cathedral but I think it's closed now ,I'm think there is a whiskey shop in Stuttgart.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />Name's Chris, I'm a designer/craftsperson and just signed up as my latest project involves me making things out of old Irish whiskey barrels. Not looking to shamelessly promote what I do, but if you wanna have a look here you go; <a href="http://www.conkrcreative.co/products.html" class="postlink">http://www.conkrcreative.co/products.html</a>. Anyhow all i need to finish it off is the packaging, and I'm thinking the sacks from the barley would make great little pouches for the bottle openers but especially the cufflinks. Anyone that could point me in the right direction would be much appreciated, might even send on a free pair of cufflinks for your troubles. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> also any suggestions on what else I could/should make? I'm wide open to ideas. <br /><br />As i said any help would be much appreciated and rewarded. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

I've always enjoyed whiskey, ever since I started drinking, and I am hopefully going to start building my collection proper and explore the various tastes and pleasures associated. I have always had a definite preference for Irish whiskeys, my favourites at the moment taking the form of Green Spot and Red Breast 12, while I'm partial to a Jameson 12, Crested Ten and Black Bush also.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Guys:<br /><br />My name is Tim and I own a liquor distribution company in San Antonio, TX. I am currently looking for an Irish Whiskey to distribute. I know painfully little about Irish whiskey other than from what I learned when I worked for Diageo. First question... is it really possible that there are only 8 distiilleries left in Ireland, two of which won't have product for another 4-5 years? <br />Secondly, what small production run whiskeys are you familiar with that might not be sold/distributed in the USA? Anything that is made by Beam, Diageo or Pernod Ricard is off limits as they most likely have exclusivity agreements with the distributors for the rest of the portofolio.<br />Any suggestions are welcome and I am looking forward to learning from you all<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />TIM</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Tim,<br /><br />And welcome to the forum. I fear you may be in a uphill battle if it is a case that the 3 big ones have exclusivity distribution deals already sorted for your area.<br /><br />The only thing I could suggeast is contact Castle Brands who own the Knappogue Castle Irish Single malt brand and I think Clontarf also. However they may have distribution already set up in Texas but I would not truthfully know.<br /><br />It may be a scenario to search out other US based brands ....<br /><br /> such as Michael Collins (Sydney Frank). A well known importer so not sure on who they deal with.<br /><br />Try Concannon Irish Blend of the Concannon Vinyard in California. Would not be aware of their supply capacity though.<br /><br />I'm sure there maybe more independent offering that others maybe be able to suggest but it may take a bit of leg work on your behalf.<br /><br />&quot; Gingers was recently sold to Beam so that is probably out for you too.</div>

I know pubs in Germany usually have a variety, especially the Irish ones. <br />The Whisky/whiskey shops are great  <br />It's usually cheaper to buy Irish whiskey there than here too. <br /><br />Have you tried any of the pot still range? Powers John's Lane or Redbreast are lovely examples and generally easy to find.</div>
