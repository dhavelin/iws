				<div class="content">Hello all,<br /><br />Just a quick post to extend an invite to any members to The Sun Tavern on Bethnal Green Road in London.<br /><br />We are open nearly 3 years now and proudly display over 140 Irish Whiskeys &amp; Poitin. <br /><br />We have an award winning whiskey list that maps out the distilleries across Ireland. The whole idea with the list is to make the experience as engaging as possible. We write a blurb about all whiskey listed and really focus on more than just the strength of the stuff for example. The list also has a 'rare &amp; limited' section as well as our rotating 'private collection' which sees vintage whiskey being sold at cost price. <br /><br />On top of the menu, our staff are trained weekly on all things whiskey - it's one thing having a great selection - but another having the staff equipped enough to talk our customers through the list. We really focus on making it an unforgettable experience. <br /><br />With all this put into practice. Our whiskey does constantly shift and is getting drank. Not just an expensive decoration.<br /><br />Classic cocktails are also a focus, so we do celebrate and feature Irish Whiskey &amp; Poitin in many drinks. If that isn't your thing - a local ale from one of 100 breweries in London, goes great with a dram.<br /><br />Heres to getting more and more drinkers, drinking Irish!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif" alt="bd)" title="Cheers" /> <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thesuntavern.co.uk/">http://www.thesuntavern.co.uk/</a><!-- m --></div>
