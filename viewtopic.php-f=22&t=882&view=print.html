				<div class="content">Don't have much info but these were made for the US market. Empty ones crop regular enough but I have not seen a full one in a while. <br /><br />The state of the contents really depends on how good or bad the cork is and how high the fill level is. <br /><br />It won't hard you though no matter how it is but if it has been exposed to the air it may have gone a bit flat or dull in taste.</div>
