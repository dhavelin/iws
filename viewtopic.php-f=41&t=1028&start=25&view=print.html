				<div class="content">I bought a Midleton 25 year old less than a month ago for 800 euro, it's supposed to be a better whiskey than the 30 year old, but because the 30 year old is (obviously) older it might push the price up but I wouldn't imagine by much.<br />Think I saw the Jameson Rarest Vintage go at auction last week for 250 euro, I think the Jameson 18 is about 100 euro in the shops so maybe a little less second hand.<br />I can't help you with the Japanese whiskies I'm afraid but a google search will give you a rough idea. If you are looking to sell I might be intertested in the Midleton 30 year old, if you could private message me with a few more photos of it (bottle number, box condition, etc) I'll take a look.</div>

				<div class="content">A Midleton 26 went on whiskyauction last month for €1,011. The 30 is harder to find than that, so it would probably go for more. You could try sticking it on whiskyauction.com. Or the Celtic Whiskey Shop might be able to give you a price.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />All the whiskies are still available, so that will have an impact on price, even the Jameson Gold can still be found online for less than €50 plus postage. The Midleton 25 for c. €800 would be a fair price, The market for the 30 yo is 'illiquid'  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  <br />However if your lucky you might find a buyer willing to pay 4 figures. With regard to the others 25% off RRP might generate a little interest from potential buyers.<br /><br />My tuppence worth, hope it helps.</div>

				<div class="content">If any one has a spare bottle of the 1969 30 year old i would love to get my hands on one. I believe the CWS  has one but i don't know the price because it's not on their web page .<br />I have a bottle of the 1973 master distillers 30 year old i would swap for it.it's similar to the one displayed above.</div>

				<div class="content">I think the one in the Celtic Whiskey shop is 2,500 euro. I'm not sure, though. That makes it the same price as the 1973 one.</div>

I have a wooden base stand with bases for 6 bottles.</div>
