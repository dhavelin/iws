				<div class="content">Hi Guys,<br /><br />Just new to this forum and the world of Whiskey collecting so wanted to ask a few questions!<br /><br />I've introduced myself on the introduction page so think I'm ok to post here and hope it's the right section.<br /><br />I plan on putting a 10 year collection together and have decided to concentrate on Single Cask releases. <br /><br />I've started off with the 16 Year Powers Single Cask 284 done specifically for CWS and yesterday purchased a nice bottle of 2007 Port finished Teeling from the distillery. <br /><br />I'm hoping to buy 5/6 bottles a year and see what I can put together.<br /><br />Any advice on what to look out for and what to avoid? <br /><br />As I said I am new to this but totally bitten by the bug and keen to learn what's what. <br /><br />Interested to see what you all have to say.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome on board. <br /><br />There's a good selection of single casks available. Redbreast have 3 out, the Celtic Whiskey Shop, The Whisky Exchange &amp; La Maison du Whisky. The prices are high at €300/200/500. Oddly the €500 was the first to sell. Power's have a few out too. It seems pubs are releasing them. It adds to the number of releases but can be a little frustrating. Midleton have been doing it for years and they fetch good money at auctions. <br />It's an expensive time to start collecting Irish Whiskey. <br /><br />Some if the newer distilleries will be releasing limited first editions but they too will be at premium prices. Only time will tell if they're a worthy investment. <br /><br />Best of luck with it. Don't jump in without research is my best recommendation. <br /><br />Sláinte</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the reply.<br /><br />I was told I've joined the party a bit late price wise but I won't let it put me off. It's a hobby really I suppose and we'll see how I get on.<br /><br />I saw the Redbreast in CWS alright it's priced at €289 I think.<br /><br />I'll keep an eye out for the new distillery releases and hopefully they'll end up worth the investment.</div>
