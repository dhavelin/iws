				<div class="content">Hi, Can anybody help me with a valuation on Kilbeggan Irish Whiskey.  Is this worth anything?<br />Lockes Crock - historic bottle 40%<br /><br />Locke's Distillery, Kilbeggan 1757-Present<br />The oldest surviving distillery in Ireland was established in 1757 in Kilbeggan, Co Meath. The distillery concentrated on the production of pure pot still and was reputably one of Winston Churchillâ€™s favourite whiskies.</div>

				<div class="content">Quite a little gem, Ciara ! You see plenty empty but rarely full.<br />As well as Churchill the old War Dog allegedly liking it another <br />claim to fame was that the Mermaid at a time in the past had to <br />cover up its nudity. This was done to get into the 'Bible Belt' in the <br />Southern U.S. states which did't like nude mermaids among a long <br />list of other things <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <br /><br />To hazard a guess on value at least 500 to 600 Euro I would think.</div>

				<div class="content">You will need to figure out fill level too, I'm guessing that there could well be quite a lot of evapouration to a jug like this as they can be quite porous and if that is the case it could affect the contents quite considerably.<br /><br />Should be able to guage by sloshing it around, if it is heavy and there is little contents movement then your looking good. But if it feels a bit light and there is plenty of sloshing going on in there is a good chance that the whiskey is not in great condition. Just to be aware as there will not be many that will pay for a half empty jug no matter how rare. Should be around 1 and a half to 2 pounds if fairly full.<br /><br />Best of luck with it though and a lovely find.</div>

Again I would stress that it was a modern crock and probably not as well glazed as <br />the old crocks.</div>
