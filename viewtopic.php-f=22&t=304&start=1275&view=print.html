				<div class="content">Have to say any of the Irish Rum finishes or blends with rum matured whiskey have not really done it for me.<br /><br />The Bushmills version were never a favourite and even though the Ally Midleton version is possibly the best I've tasted so far still down the list for me. But that's what makes these finishes so exciting .. They work for some and not others.<br /><br />Think I'll stick to my olorosso and PX favourites.</div>

				<div class="content">As you say it's all a matter of personal taste. For me the best two of all the single (or double!) casks from midletonhave been Ally's first single cask blend and the current rum cask. I just find them more interesting than the SPS bourbon cask midletons. I don't disagree on the sherry cask finishes - I would also rate the power JLs, redbreast etc. way ahead of the bourbon casks but the first and last of ally's special releases offer some interesting variety.</div>

				<div class="content">keep in mind that the SPS  that Ally gets is not just defined by its bourbon cask but, according to Crockett, is the lightest SPS distillate style that IDL make. Much as i adore SPS, I also think that this lighter distillate works well with a little grain whiskey thrown in there. When i want SPS i prefer it to be thick and aggressive like the PJL or the old green spots. Just personal taste really</div>

				<div class="content">my understanding is that the powers blend tastes more pot-stilly not so much because of the style of pot still in it but simply because its got a higher percentage of pot still in the sps/grain ratio than jemmie and paddys etc. As for PJL, that comes from the heavier sside of their distillate styles. Barry was a bit cryptic about what goes into it understandibly but, roughly, think of the CWS sps releases as the lightest end of the spectrum, than head through the light middle with yellow spot and redbreast (YS isnt just GS in a malaga cask, its a fundamentally different style of SPS distillate, all they really share is the name and the Mitchells and Sons contract) and then PJL and GS come in around the heavy mod-pot with the infamous Jemmie 15 SPS release confirmed as the only to-date unblended bottling of &quot;trad pot&quot; or very very heavy distillate to date (some of it apparently gets blended in iwht Jemmie gold etc). Barry described PJL as &quot;Heavier than Redbreast, different to Green Spot&quot; so make of that what you will.</div>

No need to go the single cask route then and then there is scope to release various sherry or blends of sherry and/or other casks.
