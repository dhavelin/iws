One of those bottles was the Lot 40...this time around the fruit notes that I had picked up in the past had slid into the background, allowing the rye notes to really present themselves.  Wow!  It was like drinking a slice of lightly buttered rye toast...awesome stuff!<br /><br />We also had Sullivan's Cove Double Cask (Australia)...luxurious fruit notes throughout...Longrow CV, Port Charlotte 'An Turas Mor'...re-confirmed that I will be purchasing another bottle before it disappears from the LCBO for good...and, to finish the evening nicely, Writer's Tears.</div>

				<div class="content">With all the discussion earlier about Lot 40, I found my bottle after a bit of tidying. I think they still use the same recipe in the newer one. <br />A unbelievable nose. It's really worth trying.<br /><br />I believe the society is planning a Canadian tasting in the near future. This is certainly one worth including if it can be sourced.</div>

Brian's coming from a wine background and the fermentation smells gorgeous. Can't wait to see what this stuff is capable of as it ages. hopefully they dont f*** it up with too much sweet sticky port and px barrels for years on end...</div>

Peter and I were down there for Feile na Bealtaine and got a nice peer into the fermentation vats followed by a rather cool saxophone quartet concert in the distillery and some newmake tasting.

				<div class="content">Saturday night, Auchentoshan Valinch and Longrow CV.  The Longrow was a blind pour done by my wife from my 36 or so open bottles.  I guessed right after narrowing it down in my mind to the Longrow and McCarthy's Oregon Single Malt.  There is a distinct anise/licorice aroma at the forefront (so far) of my Longrow CV bottle, which settled the correct guess.</div>

I expect it's a blend of pot still and malt whiskey though.</div>

After the shock of the initial sip (the initial alcohol effect), she enjoyed it enough to finish a 1/2 oz. pour.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /><br /><br />My Writer's Tears bottle is now almost 1/2 gone, in only two months or so...a repeat bottle is on the wishlist.</div>
