				<div class="content">This is changing rapidly as we speak .... We have the Dingle  distillery imminent and the Kilbeggan distillery is going strong, we also will have Carlow brewing company who will take delivery of an American still and start distilling for an Irish/American business man. Belfast distillery is in its late stages of fruition and there are solid plans for at least 3 other distilleries. So the way things are going we could have up to 10 boutique distilleries on the go.<br /><br />I did not mention tullamore as that will be a big affair.</div>

Not necessarily set up costs either however a decent sized set up to make it commercially viable will require a significant investment but for any sized outfit the amount of time it takes to see a return on the product is the biggest knock back. It will probably take at least a year probably 2 from planning before you can even distil a drop and another 3 years before your product is legal. However even in saying that you really are talking 10years before you can start doing a proper turn over. That is of course if you have by that stage found a market to buy it. There are a lot of variable in there that frighten people off.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not 100% but JohnM has enquired about this before so and has said it is not an overly difficult process so he might post here when he sees the thread.<br /><br />I think the big emphasis is on bonded warehousing and Duty.</div>
