				<div class="content">Hi JG23,<br />There another bottle in this thread <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic.php-f=41&amp;t=2371.html">viewtopic.php?f=41&amp;t=2371</a><!-- l -->. We mentioned that they have a ridiculous retail price now. I know of some are changing hand for a reasonable price. I haven't see one at auction in a while so it may be worth a try that way. I would research the different auction houses first. I know from experience that many are not sure what way to value whiskey.<br /><br /> If your selling in Ireland, I recommend that you make sure that have an online sales company too, e.g LiveAuctions. <br /><br />Buyers Commission is another consideration. This can be negotiated with some and not others. Whiskyauction.com are fixed and quite steep. They get good prices and they don't charge the seller commission so some spend a little more. I would think this would go better in an Irish auction house.</div>
