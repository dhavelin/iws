				<div class="content">I've had some of the old bottlings and thought they were nice - not unlike the Jamesons and Powers of the same era. There was also a 10-year-old one. <br /><br />Maybe the name changed when they merged with the Dublin distilleries?</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks David. I had seen that thread alright, but I suppose I was hoping someone might have something specific. Also, I wonder if it's possible hat it was spelled differently in different markets? I only ask as I think both bottles may be from a similar era - Late 70's Early 80's.</div>
