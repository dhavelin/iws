				<div class="content">I think the poll results, albeit from a small sample, are very interesting. Often with these things you get one or two clear leaders but in this case the preferences seem very spaced out. I don't know what it tells us but I can think of 3 possibilities:<br /><br />(1) Sample too small (hopefully not the case as that would tell us nothing)<br />(2) Not enough variety in the Cooley range for people to establish clear favourites<br />(3) A very broad range of tastes are represented in this forum and that preferences are very subjective meaning you should beware of buying whiskey based on someone else's marking system in books etc.<br /><br />Anyone any thoughts?</div>

				<div class="content">I've yet to taste all of them. I wonder would it be a good idea, in the future, to get a shortlist from a website poll like this and then have a judging night, where the shortlisted whiskeys are tasted blind? Might be a good tasting night? I like this idea a lot and it's not often I have good ideas.</div>

				<div class="content">I've put up a call to arms on Facce book for our international followers to give the poll a go. I'll shut it down in a couple weeks and we can see where we are.</div>
