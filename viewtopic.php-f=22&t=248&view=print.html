				<div class="content">To-day I wish to speak of the whiskey glass - the glass we use to enjoy our whiskey. I have been using the Glencairn thistle-shaped glass, but recently I had cause to use another type and - bingo!  - it was an epiphany moment.  This was it!<br />The glass was,in essence, a narrow tumbler type: 55mm in diameter,110mm high of which 30mm was the base and 80 mm the &quot;container&quot;.  This gave a great weight and solidity to what held the sovereigne liquor, and brought home to me that the experience of drinking whiskey is not just one of nose and taste. There is a strong tactile dimension as well, one that hitherto has not been given due consideration:it's just great having that solid weight in your hand. <br />Thinking further about this I recalled, of course, that the  wide tumbler has been the traditional glass for drinking whiskey.  But while it provided the comforting weight, it was too wide ( to accommodate water, ice and other pollutants) and allowed the nose to dissipate.  But the narrow tumbler preserves the nose and gives that weight in the hand.<br />Your thoughts on this neglected topic would be most welcome.</div>

				<div class="content">Firstly welcome to the forum and thanks for posting. You have raised a very interesting topic. We have not really discussed glasses that much.<br /><br />A glass is a powerful instrument in appreciating whiskey and the great thing (like whiskey) is that it can be and is a very personal choice.<br /><br />I really like the glencairn as an every day glass but I have stemless wine glasses which probably can hold close to  50cl and they are excellent for nosing ... they are deep and concave they real accentuate aroma.<br /><br />I am intrigued about your description on the narrow tumbler. Sounds very interesting any chance you can post a picture? <br /><br />I had lately come across the explanation of the tumbler ...and I was fascinated by the reasoning behind the design.<br /><br />Basically it has been designed as a glass for a chair side table the heavy base is so that you don't knock over the glass as you reach wile not paying too much attention and polishing a few more than you intended to after dinner  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'm with mawhinney on this. I'll use the Glencairn for formal tasting but I definitely don't enjoy using it. Instead, I have small, heavy glasses that are larger than shot glasses but still wouldn't take ice cubes. 70mm wide and 72mm high. Here's <a href="http://www.southernhospitality.co.nz/product.pasp?categoryid=68&amp;productid=2279" class="postlink">a photo</a> - I think it's exactly the same one.<br /><br />As you say, it's partly a tactile thing. It fits perfectly in the hand, feels solid and is a lot more manly than a Glencairn. I don't think the aroma of the whiskey is lost either.</div>

No. 9 is to me is nearly like a 'Traditional Irish' pub whiskey glass but I'm sure we don't have the exclusivity on it. <br /><br />No 1 is possibly similar to the one your talking about David.</div>

				<div class="content">My favourite is the Jmaeson nosing glass they used to sell at Midleton and Dublin. It's more or less the standard nosing glass, similar to no.11 on IWC's picture with little measurings on the side, each one being the standard engligh measure of 25ml. I once had 4, but now I'm down to one so I rarely use it as they don't sell them anymore. These days it's usually a glencairn or one of the whisky exchange's nosing glasses, similar to 10 above.</div>

				<div class="content">I drink my straight from the bottle. <br /><br />Actually, I have a few Glenfarclas glasses that were been given away in a Dublin whiskey shop, a Celtic one. I like them. The closest thing to them is No. 7. And I have on I picked up at the Munich Whiskey Festival, a bit like No.10. <br /><br />I don't like drinking out of glasses that are too fancy. It's like getting one of the proper glasses for the Weissbier. It just looks odd in Ireland.</div>

				<div class="content">All these words have their uses. Until we find a way to communicate through semaphore online, we should stick to the words. <br /><br />&quot;Of course&quot; is useful, because it removes the assumption that those reading a sentence don't know the information it contains. <br /><br />&quot;Absolutely&quot; differentiates between something that can be taken as nothing and something that actually is nothing, so it's the same nothing for everyone.<br /><br />&quot;Then again&quot; suggests a counterpoint between two thoughts. <br /><br />I vote that these phrases be kept in. They also fill up the sentences.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for thay, i feel vindicated.<br /><br />Looking at IWC's glasses again I've a couple more comments:<br /><br />No.5 - The square(ish) one. They serve whiskey in these in Ahearne's in Youghal. Lovely place, great food, but I'm not sure about square glasses. I'm quite clumsy at the best of times and I find these can result in some slight spillage. Not great when, as I've done there on occasion, you're drinking Dungourney.<br /><br />No.4 - Don't like those at all at all. Too fussy.</div>

				<div class="content">Many thanks for all the enlightened comments on the topic of the whiskey glass.  We  should give as much thought to the type of glass we use as we would to other aspects of whiskey - barrels, finishes, and so on.  <br />The more I think about the Glencairn glass the less happy I am: it's too tight and a bit pretentious and not what I would not now use to enjoy a whiskey.  A friend Jos[Josiah] says that subliminally I am reacting against the Scottish thistle shape!  He has urged me to try the Dartington &quot;Snifter&quot; - 115mm tall,75mm across the top but narrowing, then widening and then narrowing again to a heavy base (the solid &quot;tumbler&quot; factor coming into play). With this width you can get your nose - a bit - into the glass and thereby enjoy the nose and the taste simultaneously. Just like brandy in a brandy glass except that the latter is too light and ethereal for whiskey. The Snifter is heavier and earthier, appropriate to the origins and character of whiskey.<br />I tested the Snifter glass - several times.  And the man is right!</div>

				<div class="content">I routinely use Glencairns and other tulip shaped glasses and copitas.  David and I will now go outside and discuss how manly they are.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> <br /><br />Seriously though I do think if you want to get a proper nosing then it really helps if the top of the glass is narrower than its body.  However if you are out for a drink with the focus on drink then I'm not sure the vessel is very important at all.</div>
