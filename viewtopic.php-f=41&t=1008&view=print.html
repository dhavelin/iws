				<div class="content">There is plenty of information about Knappogue Castle Irish Whiskey with vintages from the 90's and 1951 but I've got a bottle that was put down in 1964 and bottled in 1977.  It seems to be a bit of an outlier.    The years are hand written on the label as well as the cask number (3) and bottle number (No. 140).   Is this a drinker, holder, seller or fake?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Pat,<br /><br />That could be a find all right, I have researched Knappogue's and in particular the private bottlings but have never come across your bottle before.<br /><br />Apart from the 'usual' 1951, i have traced a 1949, two 1950s and a 1958. Yours would be the first 1964 I have come across.<br /><br />Mr Andrews who owned Knappogue Castle in the 1970s was very interested in whiskey and purchased many casks for his private use.<br /><br />We will probably not be able to verify the bottle completely but if you can post a picture i'll do my best to help.<br /><br />Rgds Leo</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Pat,<br /><br />It is a match for a bottle I have, except the one I have is a 17yo d. 1958 b. 1975.<br /><br />What you'll notice is the bottle is square in shape, the label says from one of the oldest distilleries and it is also the product of Northern Ireland.<br /><br />I am as certain as one could be that this would be attributable to Bushmills but I don't think you will be able to prove it conclusively.<br /><br />Fantastic to unearth, let me know if you are ever parting with it,<br /><br />Rgds Leo</div>

Don't know the value, but the 1951 retails for about â‚¬1,000 (though I'd say they don't sell too many at that price). I don't think you'd get that for it, though, even though it's rarer. If you find the right buyer, you could get a nice price for it.</div>
