				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>John wrote:</cite>Hey Iain,<br />Not sure how I missed your earlier post! That was a fantastic PPS line-up, how did it all go on the night?<br />Cheers,<br />J.</div></blockquote><br /><br />It didn't quite go according to plan - we skipped the regular greenspot and redbreast 12yo adn went straight to Greenspot 10, followed by the single cask, and then the new 15yo redbreast and the 15yo Jameson. <br /><br />Thereafter it gets a bit hazy as we pretty much stuck to 2 of the 4 above. There were 2 definite winners on the night - one slightly ahead of the other - and for once my dad and I both agreed. Anyone care to hazard a guess?<br /><br />Anyway the 4 are quite different whiskeys - it's unusual in the single cask to taste a PPs with no sherry element at all. I'm not sure what the make up of the Greenspot 10yo was but there didn't seem to be a lot of sherry there either.<br /><br />In answer to IWC's question I didn't taste the 2 Redbreast 15s together that night but had done so previously. I hope you know what I mean whan I say the new bottling is, bizarrely, slightly more &quot;old fashioned&quot; than the old one - it seems to me to be slightly closer to the 15yo Jameson in style than the old one was.</div>
