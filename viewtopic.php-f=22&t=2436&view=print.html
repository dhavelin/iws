Great idea and<br />already looks to be already popular with the American visitors as it is something special to bring <br />back Stateside.</div>

				<div class="content">Sounds nice Raven, but honestly I can't help but think that IDL are starting to price themselves out of the market. Their retail prices seem to be out of kilter with much of the competition. A round €100 for a Jameson Black Barrel release filled from the cask (does that mean cask strength?), is a case in point; never mind the €260 price tag on the Dair Ghaelach (which comes in a cardboard frame <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> )!!</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with what you say but there is some modicum of reality to the Black Barrel price as it is a cask <br />strength.<br /> <br />The Dair Ghaelach price is nonsensical by comparison. The marketing seems totally over the top as well <br />as going by the CWS website there are ' 6 expressions' not different years but each cask being made <br />from a different tree ( Mind you the same species of Oak and from the same forest ). Is there something<br />I'm not getting ??? The marketing people seem to be taking over from the Distillers !!</div>

				<div class="content">Just confirmed; cask strength for sure. Current one is coming in at 59% and is in fact the third cask in the series, since March 12 believe it or not! So obviously very popular!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">It's the same price no matter what the abv happens to be. So the higher the abv of the particular batch, the better the value, kind of. <br /><br />It's also kept in an actual barrel. In other distilleries, it is just tapped through an empty barrel.</div>
