Fair play to Kilkenny though as they did not capitulate like another team could have and kept Galway with in distance and the second half we saw King Henry take centre stage and it was a wonderful battle between the two marks men.

				<div class="content">North Kerry have some strong hurling clubs. Paul Galvin is reputed to be handy with a stick when not on the catwalk or playing with the big ball. He's from Lixnaw I think which is near Listowel.<br /><br />Did I mention Wexford won the Camogie again. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />I still behind my neighbours in Kilkenny, but won't be too upset if Galway win.<br />Looking forward to the replay. <br />Hopefully it's as good as the Camogie.</div>

				<div class="content">I most say that youtube is nothing but brilliant. I have avoiding to find out the results and to night I watched the game (and had a few Redbreast, Contarf and will end now with a Connemara). I haven't seen a hurling game since 2001 so it was about time. I must say it was a great game, just feel sorry for Galway not winning but it doesn't really disappoint me as there know will be one more game.</div>

				<div class="content">Another great game! The 2012 hurling season really stands out in my mind as one of the best in recent years. I have to say that Cody has nerves of steel!; bringing on Walter Walsh - from a Junior side in KK - for his Championship debut!! Paid off though and in fairness to the young hurler, he played very well! Great to see that the natural order has been restored! <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>
