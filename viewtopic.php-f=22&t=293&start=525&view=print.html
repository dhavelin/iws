				<div class="content">Hello, <br />I am new to this board but not in age. I am attempting to broaden my horizons going from cognac to Irish or Scotch whiskey. Don't know much about it yet but hope to learn by experimentation. I was reading an old article from the New York Times the reviewer mentions &quot;IT was too good to be true. Our top-rated Irish whiskey was a six-year-old single malt for $18 with the very Irish name of Erin Go Bragh&quot;. I have a rich mans pallet and a poor mans inclination. So I signed on to this board to see if I can glean some important and life sustaining incite into the world of Irish/Scotch whiskey. I come here to learn from the masters. Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">I have a white flag that I am waving so please do not shoot yet! This is THE Irish Whiskey Society.. I know this but.... I am of Italian...and...Polish (which will explain a lot) descent and what ever other invading horde tramped through my blood line so bear with me...<br />The only Irish whiskeys so far to date that I have tried are Jameson and Bushmills-Triple Distilled. One of my local spirits purveyors suggested some Scottish whiskeys. Glenlivet, MacCallan (which was quite good) and Crown Royal from the Colonies. I have to tell you the McCallan is the only one that gets top billing so far...not in my everyday budget as of yet but you never know when I might meet the next future ex-wife! . Bushmill was very good and so was the Jameson.... But my friends I know that there must be more great Irish out there...I am still seeking that one and only!</div>

				<div class="content">We like whiskies of all sorts here, Aletheia. I'd recommend you try Redbreast 12 for starters. That might tell you if you like that style of whiskey. Then if you like that, you might like the Redbreast 15, Redbreast 12 cask strength, Green Spot, Powers John's Lane, Barry Crocket... The Jameson 12 is also good value and well worth trying. It has that sherry influence like the Macallan (although it has changed a lot in the Macallan in recent years since it's gone to the fine oak). <br /><br />Bushmills would be closest to Macallan, from this island. Maybe they 16 year old or 21 year old, as they might give some of the same floral and fruity flavours. <br /><br />If you like sherried whisky like Macallans, there's also the Tyrconnell range of finished whiskey. <br /><br />Connemaras are that bit more smokey, if you like that.</div>
