				<div class="content">This is my first post to your society forum. In the past few months I have been putting together a top quality selection of the best of Irish Whiskey's. I have been a member of the Irish Whiskey Trail for the past 4 years and I have been advised by Heidi Donelon on what she would perceive has the best 'Wish List' to compile for my pub. With our new Tullamore Dew distillery well on its way we are expecting a large number of whiskey enthusiasts to come our way and it's very important that we are ready to be able to provide them with the best quality Whiskey's and information to enhance their visit to Tullamore. It's a very exciting time for Irish Whiskey and a we are so proud that Grants have decided to bring distilling back to Tullamore. If members of the society would like to make a planned visit here to Tullamore I would be only too happy to entertain you here in the Tap and you can sample the best of my range at very good value for members. (I may also be able to organise a trip to the distillery also) I would really appreciate it if members would let me know if they are interested in this. I have posted a picture of my range on my Brewery Tap Facebook page. <br />Regards Paul Bell.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome and thanks for the offer. I'm sure thirsty members will bare you in mind when passing. I know we have a member local to you so he is probably the best person to organise anything if it is to happen.<br /><br />I see you have Tullamore Phoenix, I got a few from travel retail but just wondering if it is available in Tullamore?<br /><br />I'll pop up one of your pics for others to ogle over ...<br /><br /><img src="https://scontent-a-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/t1.0-9/1797438_10151971122705755_7574274010378845102_n.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hey there Paul,<br /><br />Welcome to the society forum and thanks again for the open invite! To everyone else here, Ove Ken and I were just down in Tullamore the other day and had an absolutely class time at the Brewery Tap! Also got a sneak peak at those new stills for the book and they're gorgeous. Separately shaped wash stills for malt and sps and at least one of those i would count as a lost irish still shape (take a wild guess which one.) Similarly, Paul, if you find yourself in Dublin any time, feel free to drop in to a tasting here any time  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I'm sure many of the soc members would love to organise a visit out to you and i know ken and Stephen are working on something to that end with John from the distillery. Once the place is up and running in september, i'm sure an IWS christening will be in order...</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome to the forum Paul. <br /><br />I think a road trip will have to be arranged. I had a look at the photos on Facebook.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
