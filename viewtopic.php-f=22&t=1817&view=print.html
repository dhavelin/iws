Bushmills 16y fits into the Daily Dram category (up to â‚¬50) and within that category it won overall &quot;Best Sherried Whisky&quot;, a separate award from the actual medals. We know that it isn't 100% sherry casks, but the Oloroso influence is predominant and as Oloroso casks are used, it qualified to be considered for the &quot;Sherried&quot; award. In fact after the A'Bunadh Batch 39 won the overall &quot;Supreme Whisky&quot; (in the DD category) the Bushmills 16y was the obvious &quot;Sherried&quot; winner.<br /><br />So congratulations (from me) on Bushmills 16y winning the &quot;BEst Sherried Whisky&quot; in our Daily Drams category, also on it winning an individual silver medal.<br />Congratulations also to Bushmills 21y for winning an overall Bronze medal (84pts) and to Bushmills 10y for an overall Bronze medal (80pts).<br /><br />In addition Redbreast 12y won a Bronze medal (83pts)<br />Yellow Spot 12y a Bronze medal (83pts)<br /><br />From my point of view it was excellent to see Irish Whiskey so well represented this year and with such good quality too.<br />Congratulations again,<br />Keith</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry for the mistake, Keith. <br /><br />I think it's a great achievement anyway, considering it's a blind tasting and it's up against very strong whiskies... and, as you'd expect, the cost of the ones winning gold is so high. Silver is very good. <br /><br />Great to see the pot still whiskeys being recognised too. And from enthusiasts dedicated to malt whisky. <br /><br />There's still a few of the gold medal whiskies available. The Pl1 is still in the Whisky Exchange. Great value for a gold medal winner. And one of the Karuizawas is still for sale in LMdW.</div>
