				<div class="content">Hey all, given the recent end of the contractless-cooley indie bottlings (and the very likely implications that has for other indie bottlings once the current contracts end), i began thinking about which of these dinosaur whiskeys i'd like to try/pack away a bottle of before its too late. Although i've never had any particular taste for Tesco whiskey etc I've always been a bit particular to the very very cheap sainsburys single malt so i asked my girlfriend who goes to school in england if she might pick up a bottle. I've never actually had the Dún Léire &quot;taste the difference&quot; bottling before as i've never really been looking for a pricier expression from sainsburys etc. Is it worth getting a bottle of that too? how do they compare?</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not up to speed with the very latest Dun Leires but i did buy a bunch of the 1st and 2nd batches. Both were excellent value Irish malts and worthy purchases. The Dun Leire is certainly superior to the Sainsbury's Irish Single Malt (Cooley), being more complex and richer. But it must be said they are similar in profile and instantly recognisable as siblings.</div>
