				<div class="content">Went out for a bite to eat in Galway tonight. Lovely Asian restaurant called the Asian Tea house which I finished off with an interesting Chinese Tea.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Anyway that's by the by ...<br /><br />Went for a stroll after in a very windy Galway city ... so as you do in windy weather you have to take cover in a premises that sells alcohol. This time it was Harvest an off licence in Galway. Harvest is quite expensive compared to Ally but they do have an interesting selection at times. However I did come across a little bargain.<br /><br />Got this for €74.99 which is cheaper than I could get it in te UK or Germany and much cheaper great value for mony per 100ml if I was to buy full bottles here of all 4. <br /><br />  <img src="http://www.spirituosen-superbillig.com/pic/863p.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />4 x 200ml<br />JW Black<br />JW Green<br />JW Gold<br />JW Blue</div>

				<div class="content">I got one of these packs from the CWS a few years ago for cheaper than it was in duty free. Great value, but they don't have them anymore. It's a great way to get to taste the JWs. I think the Green, Blue and Gold are very good. <br /><br />There are versions of this without the Blue, I think, with the Red instead.</div>

				<div class="content">Yea you'd think IDL would take a few quid off the multi pack ... just to entice people to get into those products.<br /><br />I like having the odd JW black down my local as it is not expensive. I've had the Green and Gold before also and they a good whiskies and now I can add the Blue to the list of having tried and I was very impressed.<br /><br />There is one left if anybody is interested ... I can organise it for them.</div>

				<div class="content">My latest whiskey purchase is nothing!<br />I'm pretty proud of that, as it's been hard to resist the single casks coming out at the moment.<br />But I'm saving for a much-needed holiday and just had to replace the car, so I'll have to make do with what I've got for now.<br />Thankfully, I've some more self-education in Scotch to pursue, so now I've nearly cleared all the open bottles with a dram or two left, I can open some more.<br />If I can, I might wait until after the January tasting, so as to be informed by what we dram then.</div>

If it was the old ,maybe Diageo gave Tesco a job lot deal to get rid of old stock?</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks David  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Duty used to be €10.99 per 70cl bottle at 40%<br />Now €8.72. Then vat on top of that.<br /><br />FYI for anybody else trying to calculate Duty on spirits ... % x L x €31.13<br /><br />Just wanted to be able to work exact figures.<br />And this is why I have such an issue with Irish pricingh structures.<br /><br />So take a non standard bottle of Irish whiskey<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Irish Man Rare Cask Strength</span> (nas - no age statement)<br />0.56 x 0.7 x €31.13 = €12.20 Duty<br />Then take 21.5% vat on the asking price of €125 / 1.215 =  €102.88<br />Less €12.20 Duty<br />This means that the bottle is priced at €90.68 after all taxes and duties are deducted. Yet it was available for €76 in the Neatherlands less 19% tax = €62.55. <br /><br />Difference €28.13 or 45% more expensive after taxes<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Redbreast 15yo</span> 46%<br />0.46 x 0.7 x €31.13 = €10.02 Duty<br />Less Vat on Irish asking price of €110 =  €90.53<br />To tax = €29.49 ... Irish price after Tax is €80.31 ... I have seen a Price in germany for the latest release of €59.90.<br />I'm not sure but I don't think Germany has any Duty on SPirit but they haev a 19% tax on that price. So price after tax is €50.34<br />a difference €29.97 or  59.5% more expensive  after taxes <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />and just to make it fair<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Kilbeggan 15yo Ltd 40%</span><br />0.40 x 0.7 x €31.13 = €8.72 Duty<br />Irish price €95 less 21.5% vat = €78.19 less duty = €69.49<br />Germany €64.75 less 19% = €54.41<br />Not as big a difference but still €15.08 or 28% more expensive.<br /><br /><br /><br />There has always been an arguement of higher costs and wages unless some one has a clear break down on costs say against germany of even the UK I just don't buy it. Obviously there is a difference and it has to worked in but not to the above precentages. <br /><br />I think those above are clear indications of the totally discriminatory pricing regimes that the Industry imposes on the irish Public.<br /><br />I think we should  start a campagine  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">i always thought it was funny that guinness and irish whiskey are cheaper in america, lol.  unless of course you have those good xmas deals.  i remember all bog standard irish whiskeys in pennsylvania (where i am originally from) were in and around the $23 mark.  and if on sale, could be as low as $20.  every state is different though, and some could be higher or lower.  also, 24 nitro cans of guinness at 14.9oz (i think around 440ml) were about $43 with tax included.  maybe ill start making my own whiskey, LOL</div>

				<div class="content">also, my dad always has cider in for my wife when we visit.  he gets 24 355ml longnecks of bulmers (magners in america) for $35.  the cheapest ive seen bulmers in the south was 18 500ml cans for €32.  you get a bit more for your money with the 500ml cans, but the euro is worth on average about 30% more than the dollar.  add in shipping fees, and 6% sales tax in america.  the moral of the story is its just not right.  in ireland, we get RIPPED OFF on alcohol.</div>
