				<div class="content">As prompted by John after my introduction, here's what's currently here by my desk, ready for review in Whisky Bible 2013...<br /><br />Old Bushmills (retaste of 7 of their core expressions)<br />Poitin Origin Edition<br />Connemara Bog Oak<br />Redbreast 12YO Cask Strength<br />Jameson 'Black Barrel' (a NY exclusive, so I'm told)<br /><br />Still early days and a lot more is due to arrive - Knappogue, Clontarf, Powers, a few other Jamesons, Old Kilbeggan, Midleton Very Rare etc. We are hoping to give Ireland a lot more attention in this edition, including retastes, so do speak up of any bottlings you think might be missing and I'll do my best to track them down!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ally,<br /><br />A bit of colour on the parameters for selection would be useful, I have a comprehensive listing of Irish Whiskeys released.<br />Are you interested in bottlings by year or type or currently available or recommended etc<br /><br />Should be able to give you a detailed list of whatever your looking for.<br /><br />I noticed in the current bible Jim said he would do a full review of Irish whiskey so resumably that is the project your working on.<br /><br />Ps what is the cut-off date for Jim in terms of new releases.<br /><br />Cheers Leo</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks folks, I'll look into all those...<br /><br />Leo, we're concentrating on whiskeys that are currently available in the worldwide market (country specific exclusives still count!) - Irish retastes were few and far between last year as Jim was saying, so we're aiming to be as comprehensive as possible in finding whiskeys to be revisited, new expressions released over the past year or two and ones that have simply gone under our radar.<br /><br />Core brands can be sent through to us without hesitation, limited editions/single casks should be no more than a couple of years old so we have the benefit of relevance to our readers.<br /><br />The cut off date for samples this year is not set in stone, but will be mid-summer around June/July at this point. We were a little late in going to print last year due to various delays...<br /><br />Pop me a message and I'll let you know our current office address and contact details if you need them. Cheers!</div>

				<div class="content">it's a bit of an off topic but there's also a tennessee whiskey distillery that you guys were missing in the 2012 bible. It's called Collier &amp; Mckeel and they're a pot-still operation based around Nashville. They sell a standard release and a new-make type spirit thing although its difficult to get ahold of the stuff outside tennessee. thought it might be worth mentioning, especially if one of you will be over that way during the year</div>
