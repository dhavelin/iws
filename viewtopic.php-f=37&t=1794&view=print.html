				<div class="content">I was at the Riedel tasting last night in Mitchells and that got me thinking about glasses. I liked their whiskey glass - it noses well but it's easier to drink from than a Glencairn.<br /><br />Speaking of Glencairns, I don't want another one from the society in January. Everybody should have one but they are impractical for drinking from so a differently-shaped glass would be nice to get (not etched, preferably). Trying a whiskey in different glasses can reveal new aspects of its character. A new glass would encourage such experimentation.<br /><br />The Riedel glass would be too expensive but I wonder if it's possible to source the &quot;traditional pub glass&quot; that is number 9 in IWC's photo here:<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic.php-f=22&amp;t=173.html">viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=173</a><!-- l --></div>

				<div class="content">The ISO glass is the one  I use for all tasting in the shop. . We also use it for evaluating wines to buy in etc. In my experience it is the best all rounder. The fact that it has a stem allows you to decide if you want to warm the contents with your palm etc...</div>

				<div class="content">I'm in work later on and will try to find the price list i had for glasses.<br /><br />I was lucky to pick up 6 old Whiskey Glasses (no.9 in  IWS's picture) for €3 recently. I wish they had 50 more. I prefer them to the Glencairn glass myself.<br /><br />Rachel Lindsay had a discussion about it <a href="viewtopic.php-f=22&amp;t=1767.html" class="postlink">here</a> . Well worth considering trying other options.</div>

				<div class="content">Ah, well done! For myself, I'd like a glass I can comfortably drink from or serve a whiskey to someone else in. That fits the bill, perfectly. It would be also be a nice thing for the IWS to encourage the rediscovery of an &quot;Irish&quot; whiskey glass (based on the discussion elsewhere on this forum, anyway).</div>

				<div class="content">That's another thing I like about these glasses, they are easier to pour into when you've had a few because they have a larger diameter rim. Less chance of wasting the precious,<span style="font-style: italic">my precious</span> .</div>
