				<div class="content">Hi, I am looking to get a friend a bottle of Irish Whiskey for his 30th Birthday. As I have no idea about whiskey I was wondering if someone could suggest a couple of bottles which may do the trick.<br /><br />All I know is that he doesn't like Scottish Whisky (he is Irish after all), he doesn't like whiskey with a peaty/earthy taste, he likes it to be a smooth flavour. This all means nothing to me so any help or advice would be great!<br />I am looking to spend about 150-200 pounds.<br /><br /><br />Thanks!!</div>

It's way above that price braket, though. <br /><br />What about a Bushmills Millennium? Or a Jameson 18... Then there's the Midleton single cask available at the Celtic Whiskey Shop of the one at Terminal One at Dublin Airport.</div>

				<div class="content">£150-200 would suggest your in the UK.<br /><br />Avoid Connemara if he is not into peated whiskey but pretty much everything else should be fine.<br /><br />You have 2 good options and both have reasonable postal charges. Further anything in your price range will be a nice and decent bottle.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/" class="postlink">The Whisky Exchange</a> in the UK<br /><br />Best bottles here would be<br /><br />Redbreast 15yo<br />Jameson 18yo<br />Midleton Very Rare 2010 (The 2011 will not be released till the end of the year)<br /><br />There is also the Jameson Rarest Vintage 2007 which is £250 and possibly too expensive but an amazing whiskey.<br /><br />&amp;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/" class="postlink">The Celtic Whiskey Shop</a> in Dublin<br /><br />Currently the CWS has a bigger selection of Irish Whiskey.<br /><br />You could go for a <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/Jameson_Reserves_Gift_Set-z-product-product-78-context-brand-page-1.htm" class="postlink">Jameson Gift box which has 3 x20cl bottle</a> of their reserve bottles with a 12yo, Gold &amp; 18yo. SO 3 for the price of one.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier there is a <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/Midleton_Single_Cask_71578-z-product-product-796-context-brand-page-1.htm" class="postlink">SIngle Cask Midleton</a> which is a fairly exclusive bottle.<br /><br />Even more exclusive and slightly above you budget is the <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/Greenspot_10_Year_Old_Pure_Pot_Still_Whiskey-z-product-product-70-context-brand-page-1.htm" class="postlink">A Limited Edition Green Spot</a> and comes in a decent wodden box.<br /><br />However if you know some one in Dublin they might Pop in to the Jameson Heritage Centre in Bow St and get you a Personalised Jameson 12yo. You could then buy another bottle also maybe like the Redbreast 15yo and you get a Birthday boy who it twice as happy  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Just to let you know the Bow Street 12yo is actually a different whiskey to the regular Jameson 12yo.</div>

				<div class="content">You can now get the Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve for £250 at the Whisky Exchange, which has a branch in London - Vinopolis<br />1, Bank End, London SE1 9BU.<br /><br />I think it's a pretty special whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Lozza<br /><br />The Whisky Exchange is located in the Vinopolis<br />Address ... 1, Bank End, London SE1 9BU.<br /><br />Edit: Ooppps John you beat me to it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> <br /><br />It is one of the top Whisky shops in the UK and the staff are very good. Obviously London is a big place but if you can get a chance to pop in there as it would be well worth it for any advise they could give you also.<br /><br />I mentioned the Jameson Rarest Vintage earlier. This comes in a big heavy box and looks pretty impressive but it is also should be a very impressive whiskey for an Irish Whiskey lover. However the consideration is would it be worth spending that amount on one bottle or would you be better off getting 2 decent bottles.  I have one open at the moment and must admit I'm glad I bought it but in general it is very hard Justifying such an out lay ... but that is a decision only you can to make. Good luck and I hope the lucky bugger appreciates the effort you are going to  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I see the Whisky Exchange lists a 15yo Tyrconnell single cask for £55. That would be my top choice from there, regardless of price. A 10-year old port finish Tyrconnell would be a good companion (port is my favourite but many rate the madeira higher).</div>
