In fact, I think I'll start calling it &quot;Patrick&quot;.<br /><br />I have an ongoing struggle with IDL to get press releases so I haven't been able to write this up myself yet. It's very exciting news though, and it's a whiskey I really look forward to tasting.</div>

				<div class="content">Literally only broke lunchtime today, hear you on the press release, stumbled upon it myself.<br /><br />Overall great news, the original Paddy was a 7yo pot still before it became a 10yo, deliberate choice I guess to go with 7yo for that reason. great to see the heritage being mined.</div>

				<div class="content">Looking forward to this and as regards price:<br /><br />IDL are going to keep pushing up price for two reasons:<br /><br />1. Higher price = Whiskey appear more luxury / limited / a bottle to really treat yourself etc<br /><br />2. Main Reason: Asian Market - they cant get enough irish whiskey! Therefore demand for more exports is out stripping supply as with delays in putting some whiskies into certain markets!<br /><br />IDL are expanding warehouses regularly also and it all leads to one point demand is ahead of supply. To keep the market on a consistent boom your regular jameson etc needs to remain competitive.<br /><br />However the more exclusive whiskeys can be priced upwards as they will sell as the market for luxury irish whiskey is on an alarming rise in my opinion worldwide.<br /><br />Yes we may not be happy with rises but IDL can afford to charge them unfortunatly!</div>
