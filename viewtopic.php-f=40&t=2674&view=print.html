				<div class="content">I've looked at references about other distilleries in Wexford too. Roe &amp; Flecher had one in New Ross back in c1785.

It was closed in 1709 because there were more stills on site than revenue was getting tax for.<br /><br />That's 4 Distilleries so far.<br /><br />I wonder if the Roes were any relation to George Roe.<br /><br />On M.C. Harvey of Bishopswater having the distillery before Devereaux, I think they were related. I have read it somewhere and hopefully I can remember.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Roe &amp; Fletcher New Ross.</span><br />I have always been of the impression that the Roe of the Roe and Fletcher distillery was related to the Dublin Roe's although have no definitive proof. The distillery at Creywell was set up by Roe &amp; Fletcher in 1785 ,according to Basset's. Pigot's directory tells us that it had been converted into a brewery by 1824.Cherry Bros took over the brewery some 6 years later in 1830 and continued on the same site until the mid 1950's .The Cherry's business being transferred to the former Strangman Davis brewery in Waterford which became Guiness and is now the Waterford Distillery . It would be nice to think that the Waterford Distillery has a link to the Roe Distillery on Thomas St in Dublin.<div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Taghmon Distillery</span><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Good Whiskey Hunting wrote:</cite> <br />I found that another was mentioned in Barnard's- distilleries of the UK. It was closed in 1709 because there were more stills on site than revenue was getting tax for. That's 4 Distilleries so far. </div></blockquote><br /><br />I could not find the mention in Barnard's, however a fourth distillery is mentioned in &quot; The  Lost Distilleries of  Ireland&quot;.<br />This mentions a distillery at Bishopswater that predated the Harvey/ Devereaux distillery and owned by John Devereaux( also mentioned in Irish Whiskey by E.B. McGuire), I feel that this may be incorrect . The name is right but not the location. In 1791 it is noted that a large distillery was owned by William Devereaux of Taghmon. The distillery sat in a large parcel of land in the centre of Taghmon and was offered for sale in that year.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">In 1791 the following advertisement appeared in the Leinster Journal 14th Sept 1791:</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic">To be let and entered on immediately for a term of years.<br />A large distillery in the town of Taghmon and county of Wexford.<br />Application to be made to William Devereaux in said town,who will give<br />good encouragement to anyone who undertakes it. Sept 6 1791,<br />N.B. The taker can be accommodated with any quantity of land he chooses.<br />Very convenient.</span><br /> John was Williams son ,both had prominent positions in the rebel forces of 1798 and were involved in the fighting at Ross and presumably at the nearby Horetown and Foulksmills.John escaped the clutches of the loyalists and was later exiled . William did not fare as well , an old man he was captured and thrown into Wexford goal where he cheated the hangman by dying before the could put a noose around his neck.<br />Regarding your story re the closure of the distillery which predated William Devereaux but would seem to have operated on the same site ,the following is a piece from the Taghmon Historical society..<br /><br />&quot;In bygone years Taghmon was also not without its own distillery. However, it met its demise in a somewhat curious manner. <br />About one hundred and sixty years ago a distillery flourished in Taghmon. The site of the distillery is in a perfect state of preservation today and in the possession of Mr. M. J. Cullen merchant, Main Street, Taghmon. The distillery proper was situated in Joseph Street Taghmon. The big stores, visible from Green Garden Street, were used for malting purposes. The remains of the grain chutes can be observed and also the corn lifts can be seen. <br />The concern was owned by Bolgers who were at the time the leading business people in South Wexford. The downfall of this distillery was as follows. In the summer of 1709 a revenue officer under an escort of a troop of yeomanry arrived in the town and made a raid on the distillery. The officer found two stills working although the owner had only license to work one still. The whole machinery was dismantled and in addition the owner was fined Â£200. So that ended the distillery in Taghmon.&quot; <br />Written by: Fintan Martin who heard it told by his father (Mr. M. J. Martin) who heard it from Mr. P. Pender age 86 years, still living in Taghmon. IFC S 83:171-172 <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.taghmon.com/vol4/chapter09/chapter09.htm">http://www.taghmon.com/vol4/chapter09/chapter09.htm</a><!-- m --><br />In the 1802, Returns of Licensed Stills. the Taghmon distillery is licensed to John Breen and had an output of 210 galls. It fails to appear in any returns after that year.</div>

I don't have my &quot;Distilleries of the U.K.&quot; at the moment so I'm going from memory and that's not always reliable. <br /><br />I know the story of the Taghmon distillery that closed but couldn't figure out how tax was being paid for still in the region in 1825. <br /><br />I've been looking into the mention of Simon Lacy Distiller in Clonegal. There a record of a distillers house but my computer froze before I could dig further.

The booklet &quot;Clonegal in 1798&quot; lists Simon Lacy as a distiller and gives his address as Johnstown/Ballyshonogue/Clonegal . The National Inventory of Architecture has details of his house&quot; Ballyshonogue&quot; in the townland of Johnstown  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&amp;county=WX&amp;regno=15700404#">http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/s ... =15700404#</a><!-- m --> <br />The OSI maps show the house and the mill/distillery in an adjacent field . the mill being in a ruinous state and the mill race disappeared underground. <br />In the British Parliament papers of 1805/6 &quot; an account of the number of stills licensed in Ireland&quot; (page 797-800) the distillery is listed as in Wexford  licensed to Simon lacy having 1 still with an output of 533 galls avg.<br />From the entry in Lewis's A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, 1837, It would seem that the distillery closed shortly after 1806,as the following chapter refers to it having closed 20 years prior to publication......<br />&quot;JOHNSTOWN, a village, in that part of the parish of MOYACOMB, or CLONEGAL, which is in the barony of SCAREWALSH, county of WEXFORD, and province of LEINSTER, nearly adjoining the village and post-town of Clonegal, on the road from Ferns to Tullow; containing 45 houses and 235 inhabitants. Here was formerly an extensive distillery, which was discontinued about 20 years since: it has been lately taken down, and a large flour-mill erected on its site by Mr. Derinzy, of Clonegal.&quot;</div>

Barnard did comment on the malthouses of Patrick Roche as he made his way through Enniscorthy to visit the Bishopswater Distillery. Roche originally had maltstores in New Ross near to the Creywell Distillery/Brewery ,before building the stores in Enniscorthy and taking up residence in the castle. The old malt stores now occupied by Dunnes in one and the other is The Baily pub.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Enniscorthy Distillery.</span><br />In the first post ,we started  with reference to the connection of the Davis family and the distillery at Island Road/Mary Street. However ,the distillery was already up and running for nearly 12 months prior to their involvement.<br />The distillery was actually started by &quot; James Haig Miller &amp; Co&quot; J.H.Miller being described as distiller,dealer &amp; chapman. If you have read the post on the Fairfield Distillery and Andrew Jameson's divorce,the name will have a familiar ring,James Haig Miller being called to the House of Lord's ,to testify on Jameson's behalf in his divorce petition.<br />The Distillery on set up consisted of.......<br />Three brewing coppers,<br />Metal mash tuns,<br />Two coolers, <br />A steam engine &amp; 2 steam boilers,<br />6 wash backs 5,000 galls each, wash chargers,<br />Spirit receiver and store casks.<br />The still ,was a <span style="font-weight: bold">Coffey Patent Still.</span><br />The sum of 6,000 pounds was expended on the setting up of the distillery. The complex included malt houses,out houses , a dwelling house and garden.<br />Within 12 months of setting up the distillery ,it was having financial problems and was in arrears of duty to the crown.James Haig Miller was declared bankrupt.<br />The distillery was auctioned on the 19th Nov 1835 - as<br /> &quot; Newly -erected Distillery at Enniscorthy,<br />To be sold by private contract-<br />In the matter of James Haig Miller bankrupt.<br />(The Wexford Conservative)<br />There had been a previous excise sale in March 1835for arrears of duty and this consisted of 4,000 galls of old whiskey ( The Wexford Conservative). As the distillery was barely up and running,was this OLD Whiskey perhaps from Fairfield which had recently stopped production?<br />Moving on, In January 1840 Enniscorthy was visited by Fr. Matthew and he signed up 19,000 people to the pledge.<br />At that stage the distillery was stated to be capable of producing 40 Puncheons ( 4400 Galls) per 14 day period.<br />This was to be the nail in the coffin and the distillery was put up for sale by Richard Davis jun. on the 6th Nov 1840 .( The Wexford Independent). Beside the distillery The sale included ,&quot; A commodious dwelling house,with stables &amp; coach house&quot;. Although the distillery and the end of terrace house on Mary Street were destroyed in the building of the railway and tunnel. It is highly likely that &quot; Antwerp House&quot; which exists to this day is the house described in the sales literature of 1840. <br />See Buildings of Ireland....  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&amp;county=WX&amp;regno=15603127">http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/s ... o=15603127</a><!-- m --><br /><div class="inline-attachment">
