				<div class="content">Just emptied the bottle bin at the recycling bank. A few bottles now laid to rest over the last few months.<br /><br />Chapter 7 13yo Sherry Single Cask @ 59.5%. I really love this so much so I have started a second and have a 3rd in the cellar.<br />Jameson 18yo, lovely stuff but I can't really justify the price so probably will not have another for a long while.<br />West Cork Dha Chasca, this is obviously a Cooley and is matured in Bodega Sherry casks &amp; finished in double charred first fill Bourbon casks. Was hard for me to get past the young cooley style as I don't think cooley comes into it's own until well into it's late teen and early 20's. Not a bad effort though and the price point was very fair. West Cork are starting to get things going. Give them another few years and they might have a few winners.<br />Johnny Walker Gold Label. A wonderful blend from JW and highly recommended. Smooth &amp; easy drinking but complex all the same and full of flavour.<br />Makers MArk one of my fave bourbons and sadly no replacement for the time being. <br />Clarkes Bourbon (Aldi) @ €15 a bottle this is not bad at all. Does for a quick nip with ice after a few beers.<br />Glen Marnoch Peated single Malt from Aldi. These were very cheap and well worth teh price. A bit young and fiery though but does the job. Often used it to blend with non peated Scotch and does a rgeat job of peating non peated whisky  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

I tried the Glen Marnoch and thought the same. Definitely worth a go. I'll have to try that Chapter 7. I've heard great things about them.</div>

				<div class="content">Don't worry Willie I was not swilling full bottles all over Christmas or anything. For instance JW Gold was opened in in August as I got in on holiers last year and opened it the minute I got home  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Jameson 18yo was on the go for much longer possibly 2016 and the Chapter 7 was in between those.<br />I've circa 20 open currently which is very good for me as I often have much much more ... Being sensible in my old age  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>
