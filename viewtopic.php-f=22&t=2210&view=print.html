				<div class="content">The 26 year old was double distilled in 1987 and the 30 year old double <br />distilled in 1983.Cooley started production in 1989 with Tyrconnell *** star <br />being first out of the traps ( in Greyhound speak ). This begs the obvious <br />question of which Irish Distillery are they from being doubly distilled at this <br />period ??? <br /><br />Just saw them at the Loop in Dublin Airport. There was a time I wouldn't have <br />hesitated just bought ( bloody Recession). Packaging etc.looks very well and a <br />great addition to the Irish Whiskey range. Again great article by David H in his <br />recent '<span style="font-weight: bold">Liquid Gold</span>' blog.</div>

				<div class="content">I haven't tasted these, but heard the 26 was great. <br /><br />Any of the aged Teelings stuff I've tasted has been a bit of a revelation. Amongst the best Irish whiskey available, for me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't afford the two new ones.</div>

				<div class="content">The 26yrs old was tasted at the recent Cork Chapter tasting. It was my favourite of the night. We are on again in The Oval Bar next Wednesday 21st in Cork. We are hosting the Irishman range aka Walsh Distillery. See you there 730pm.</div>

				<div class="content">I tasted both Whiskeys and the 26 year old is a great Whiskey. Also the 30 year old one is good but my favourit one is the 26 year old Teeling.<br /><br />I think also that it could be from Bushmills.<br /><br />Best regards<br />Mareike</div>

				<div class="content">I assumed it was Bushmills. Is there any doubt?<br /><br />I liked the 26 at last years President's tasting. I haven't tried the 30 year old but hopefully I'll get my hands on a sample soon.</div>

				<div class="content">i also assumed Bushmills but wanted clarification. <br />Nevertheless still a surprise. To believe the marketing <br />people there was no such thing as double distillation in <br />Ireland prior to Cooley. Then again why would one believe <br />people who market a product  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /></div>

				<div class="content">Ok, someone has lost the plot! In T2 Dublin Airport at the moment and the Teeling 30yo is selling for €1,800 or €1,500 duty free. That duty free price is the same as the high street price! Hope someone can avail of the 'twice x price differential' discount policy that the DAA have in place <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />Have to say though, there would appear to be a general trend of taking off the duty (where it applies) and then raising the price, shame as The Loop was starting to be a good spot to get some deals.</div>

				<div class="content">Totally agree, they are now very regularly priced higher than High street and their duty free versus non duty free prices are a Joke.</div>
