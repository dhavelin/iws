I wonder who is responsible for that <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />I think I will register myself anyway, just in case.. who can resist if you could get a bottle for free? definitely not.

				<div class="content">I guess all good things come to those who wait, given that the news section of the website is being updated regularly I'm sure we haven't been forgotten. I'm speculating that they are waiting for something to be packaged up.<br /><br />This would be fantastic albeit a very generous welcome  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />&quot;For those interested in trying all four single pot still whiskies, there will be a taster pack available soon, with a generous 50ml bottle of each, perfect for two people. These will be available in Dublin airport duty-free and from the Celtic Whiskey Shop in Dawson Street (€39.95). The full bottles are available in most off-licences throughout the country. For further details of pure pot still whiskeys, see singlepotstill.com.&quot;  <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.irishtimes.com">www.irishtimes.com</a><!-- w --><br /><br />Hmmm that would be nice!<br /><br />Ps not starting a wild rumour, only having a guess...<br /><br />That said I personally would be happy with a little exclusive members pack</div>

				<div class="content">Possibly not the best place to post this but ...<br />The Sunday Business Post of 4th December 2011 had a write-up on Irish Whiskey - Agenda pp12 - article by Támas Clancy.<br />One of the sections was entitled &quot;the joys of pot still&quot; and highlighted the recent releases from Midleton ... BUT the text inferred that these were the only Irish whiskeys to come out of a pot still - the rest coming from from &quot;cathedral high rows of column stills in gleaming steel&quot;.<br />Getting the &quot;Single Pot Still &quot; message out to the world is going to be a tough task if we can't get it through at home <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  .<br />...<br />its worth quoting a bit more ...<br />&quot;In Midleton, Colley and Bushmills, cathedral high rows of column stills in gleaming steel testify to brilliant engineeringd a desire to compete on a world stage in the mass whiskey market.  However, in the corner of each distillery, and taking centre stage in Kilbeggan, are what we amateurs think of as the classic machinery of the distillery - the pot stills, with their brass and copper pipes, tiny levels and reassuring analogue dials.&quot;<br /><br />Michael</div>

				<div class="content">Another case of lazy and sloppy reporting by some one who obviously has not an iota of what they are talking about. Bushmills don't even have Column stills and if he knew anything about whiskey he should of known that. And it's the column stills that are tucked in the corners at Midleton where the impressive &quot;pot stills, with their brass and copper pipes, tiny levels and reassuring analogue dials&quot;  take center stage.<br /><br />Someone should hit him over the head with a pot still ...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">Speaking of not very well informed articles, did anyone see the piece in Go Rail magazine, Oct-Dec edition?  Oh dear.  No link, but you don't want to know.  At least it didn't say Midleton is the only Irish distillery to use pot stills.  It did spell Bushmills with an apostrophe, however.  And didn't mention this year's pot still renaissance, which one would have thought was the single most important thing to hit Irish if not world whiskey this year, and perhaps therefore newsworthy.</div>
