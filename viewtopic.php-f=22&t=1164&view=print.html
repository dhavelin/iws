Why is the Brewery name in English and the Distillery name in Irish by the way, just curious.<br /><br />Co-incidentally, I remember having a conversation with someone at WhiskeyLive about the possibility of potentially another new distillery to be opened in the North West. Anyone care to corroborate?!</div>

				<div class="content">In relation to 'The Dingle Brewery' the article suggests that they will also distil a spirit, whether it is true or not I don't know. If true it can be called both a brewery and a distillery, not unusual in the micro-distilling sector.

				<div class="content">Does anyone know where the Knockeen Hills &quot;Poteen&quot; is distilled - I ask as I think I read somewhere they were distilled in Waterford. I'd imagine they're grain neutral column distilled spirits but if this is the case and they're not made in an existing whiskey distillery then is it not at least possible that there is another distillery that could produce a grain whiskey?</div>

I really must try one at some stage, maybe age it a bit in one of my little barrels. I don't know what component ingredients are used in making them but assuming grain is involved and a still of some sort it would seem to me that, unless these are distilled in Midleton or Cooley then there is another distillery or two that could make whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">Apologies guys - though what I'm really trying to do is see can we turn a white spirits distillery into a whiskey distillery - making 8 by 2013! So does anyone know where and how these are distilled? <br /><br />Here's what I'm thining - if they were grain only spirits without anything added but weren't produced in Midleton or Cooley, would it be possible to get them to fill a cask, even say a quarter cask? By any definition I know we would then have a single grain whiskey after 3 years which wasn't from one of the recognised whiskey distilleries.</div>

				<div class="content">I asked the Bunratty guy once. He said his poteen was made just like I thought it was made (that's how he put it), namely in a pot. And it has that glorious fruity ester smell of new make pot still spirit, so I believe it. It's a mix of grains too, as far as I recall, ie not all barley. So that would make a pot still whiskey, if matured.<br /><br />I looked at my Knockeen Hills bottle. It just says it's triple distilled from grain. I'm still leaning towards a pot still here too.</div>

				<div class="content">So the question is where? There must be some reason why these guys don't cask some given the rising interest in whiskey.<br /><br />Of course thye could be made under licence in Midleton given that gin and vodka are also made there - that's the bit we tend to forget when we talk about midleton.</div>

				<div class="content">If one reads the label on the Bunratty Potcheen bottle is states - 'Grain Neutral Spirits'.  I believe it also states that it is flavoured.  My understanding of grain neutral spirits is that it is commercially produced in a column still.  It can be bought by the barrel for much cheaper than it is to produce a batch of spirit in a pot still.  Some small distilleries in the US that are starting up buy these grain neutral spirits, may add some flavouring, label the bottle their own and sell them.  It is very much frowned upon as you're not actually distilling anything if using GNS.  It does get cash flowing in the begining as it takes years to see any return on investment on whiskey.  Could anyone else confirm that Bunratty Potcheen uses flavoured GNS?  Bunratty is a lot cheaper than the Knockeen hills so this may also explain the price discrepancy.</div>
