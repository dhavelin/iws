				<div class="content">okay, so my attempt at moving to america didn't work, haha.  many issues came up.  wifes father is sick, mother is very ill, i cant find sustainable work here, etc...  anyway, enough moaning.  long story short, does anyone know of any kind of work in ireland?  i will be moving back to galway and i know a lot of you live in dublin.  just throwing it out there to see if anything is available.  my wife has a good job but we desperately need a second income, even if its part time for right now.  i do have a bachelors degree in IT, although it has never really done me any good.  any info you guys/gals can pass on, would be greatly appreciated.  <br /><br />other than that, nothing new here.  just trying to stay off the drink because of lack of funds   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /></div>

I'm always seeing stuff online that I'd love but it's too tricky or expensive to get it sent here.</div>

				<div class="content">thanks guys   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />that is a good idea david.  i would love to do something like that.  i might look into it more.  we actually toyed with the idea of importing irish stuff here to sell, but its just so damn expensive to ship   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  <br /><br />i guess for time being i will get back into the photography stuff.  there seems to be a HUGE demand for pub photos with surnames here in america.  my wife has just been so busy with her parents that she hasn't had time to get out for more pics.</div>
