				<div class="content">It's been while coming but Menno Bachess has now added Irish Whiskey to the database at Whiskybase:<br /><br /><ul><a href="http://www.whiskybase.com/" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #000040">Whiskybase</span></span></a></ul><br />The site is a good fun way to see your collection and as it can be exported to Excel it can be useful for managing it.  The number of Irish bottles in the database at the moment is quite small, but that can easily be changed by a bit of diligent effort from the users.  <br /><br />If there are labels that you have that are not in the database then you can pm them to Menno and he will add them.  It can be a bit slow but they tend to get a lot of work when a new section is added.  You can add bottles yourself as long as there is a section for it.  They will check for info on the bottle before they confirm it, but it usually doesn't take too long.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks a million Willie ... been there when it started first but was put off by the lack of an Irish category. I ddn't like the idea of having a list of scotch and not having any Irish in their. However that was pre the Irish Whiskey input which is now more exciting for us.<br /><br />Will throw an eye over and see what I can do, the heads up is appreciated  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
