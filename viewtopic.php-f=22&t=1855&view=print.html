				<div class="content"><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Did you miss out on the chance to obtain Irish millennium whiskeys way back in 2000?  Hadn't the money?  Hadn't the interest/knowledge?  Just got married?  Too young?<br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Fret not!  Now I can help you  by directing you to IRELAND'S SECRET MILLENNIUM WHISKEY!  A truly delightful whiskey that I am currently sipping; it is available and very affordable but (alas !) only 714 bottles produced.<br />It is, of course, The Irishman 12 year old Single Malt, bottled November 2012,which those of you who have mastered advanced sums, will now have deduced was <span style="font-weight: bold">distilled</span>  in the year of the Millennium.<br />Go get!</div>

Luckily you were standing by to step into the breach  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I only <a href="http://www.liquidirish.com/2013/01/the-irishman-12-year-old-single-malt.html" class="postlink">posted</a> on this one last week, but I haven't tried it so it's good to hear a personal recommendation. I like the simplicity of the label too.</div>

				<div class="content">***Slight, though related, thread hi-jack***<br /><br />Hi DavidH (and others),<br /><br />Seeing your post about the Irishman 12 (and subsequent note about 2013 being a big year - including having US representation) I was wondering about thoughts on these two bottles, which are currently at Binny's (a large liquor chain - 29 stores and growing - in the Chicago area):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.binnys.com/all/irishman#/?page=1" class="postlink">http://www.binnys.com/all/irishman#/?page=1</a><br /><br />Is the cask strength bottle worth the $130 price tag?  For reference, $130 would get you bottles like Macallan 17 Fine Oak ($135), 1989 Balblair, Dalmore Cigar Malt, Bruichladdich PC6 or PC8, Midleton Very Rare ($139), and Bushmills 21 ($119).<br /><br />If other Irishman bottles become available (in US or Canada), which ones would you recommend?<br /><br />Edit to add: The Single Malt bottle was/is available (only one bottle listed currently) in Ontario @ $60.<br /><br />Thank you in advance!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

My wonderful wife gave me a bottle of the WT for Christmas...I'm waiting to open it after I've knocked off a couple of near empty bottles first.  Between the WT, the Lot 40 Canadian rye, and Sullivan's Cove Double Cask from Australia all waiting to be opened, I sense a 'non-Scotch' night shaping up in the future.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>
