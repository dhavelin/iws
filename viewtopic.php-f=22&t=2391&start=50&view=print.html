				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>I think it said on the email that they had held stock back.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I placed an order on the 13th. There was no sign of anything for a week so I call last Monday 21st to check. They told me that a consignment of about 300 bottles had arrived and they were getting them packed for postage. <br />Arrived on the 23rd,  Just in time. <br /><br />I don't think there's too many left now. I know a good few who took advantage of the second offer to stock up with a couple more.</div>
