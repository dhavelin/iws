				<div class="content">For those going to the distillery launch on our behalf, do we have any questions that can only be answered at the distillery? I would like to place the new SPS botlings in relation to Redbreast and Green Spot. We know that Green Spot is based on a heavier pot still spirit than Redbreast. What about the new ones?<br /><br />Obviously there is significant sherry influence in both Redbreast and Green Spot. There is none at all in the new Midleton but how about the Powers?<br /><br />How old are the whiskeys in the Midleton?</div>

				<div class="content">Just happened to come across some notes I had on Greenspot which I thought I had lost on an old PC. <br /><br />Whiskeys used are 7-8 years old. 25% Sherry content so I presume 75% Bourbon which actually is probably consistent to the price point of 6 to 7 years ago due to the expensive nature of sherry casks. <br /><br />Further this is actually plenty of sherry content to give it a decent amount sherry character without the sherry dominating which is the case in the Greenspot. This info is possibly out of date as there is a suspicion that the whiskeys now used are around the 6 yo mark. Might be another question to ask the experts.</div>

				<div class="content">I have two problems with this news.<br /><br />Firstly, that a continental retailer has this release before anyone here - I mean come on IDL, for God's sake. <br /><br />Secondly, when it was launched, every news item quoted an RRP of €160 - now this MdW retailer is retailing the bottle at €178.00! Going on past experience w.r.t. EU pricing that could mean very bad news for us here because the European retailers are almost always typically cheaper. <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />It is very hard to develop any form of brand loyalty or appreciation for what IDL are doing when they treat Irish consumers in this manner.<br /><br />On a more positive note, Luke I also like their 'Pure Pot Still' section - a touch of class in my opinion! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">I have no information on what is leading to the staggered launch but there is significant red tape around alcohol labelling and it's different in each country. So it's possible that the bottling is released first where it gets the regulatory nod first. In that scenario, instead of holding every market back until they are all ready to go, the whiskey is being released as early as possible to whiskey drinkers.<br /><br />Just speculation, of course. Plus I'm already sorted because I favoured the John's Lane of the two new SPS whiskeys <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>

No-one has any information. All we know is that for whatever silly reason, a product made here won't be released here until certain other markets have been supplied. Also, that the retail price will be dearer than people were originally lead to believe.<br /><br />I can't imagine France's market entry rules to be less stringent than Ireland's. In fact, the EU as whole has almost the same trade terms - save some differing label &amp; language descriptors. And it's not like the product appeared out of thin air; years of planning would have gone into the development and launch of this.<br /><br />As a Society we should send some form of correspondance to the distillery highlighting how Irish consumers are being put to the back of the line. It shouldn't be all one-way communication in terms of them simply showing up whenever they want to sell us something new. Loyalty is a two way street!!</div>
