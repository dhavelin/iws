				<div class="content">&quot;Please keep posting your progress. It's very inspiring and educational!&quot;<br /><br /><br />Dave, I am hoping to get input from many folks on any part of this project. 17.00 for 50  pounds /22.73 kilos <br />(( of flaked barley)) is a far cry from the over 100 us dollars for 50 pounds if i go to the supplier or have the already malted grain  shipped to me. The grain is $45 the shipping is $50 or the cost of  petrol is $50 then a half day out always finds us in a resturant since the supplyer is near BUSH GARDENS AMUSEMENT PARK.<br /><br /><br />Another area of concern is emulating the water of Ireland. All i can find is this burton on the trent salts. I dont know what else to do. I will treat  distilled water with the salts.<br />I dont know enough about water to do better. I wish there was a way to learn more. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

A good example, perhaps, is Writers Tears whiskey. That's a blend of both malt and pot still whiskeys made in the same distillery. There would be no point doing that if malt and pot still tasted the same.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Scotty,<br /><br />Following your progress with interest and envy you the fact that you can boil away to create your own concoctions while we over here are banned by law doing such  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />Anyway keep the posts going we are reading.<br /><br /><br />Just a quick observation on this ...<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>scotty wrote:</cite>My reasoning is that since a malt is any grain that has been put through the malting process to activate the enzymes,;  i am guessing that it wont make any difference in the end result if i use the amylases . Just guessing/hoping too.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Firstly in relation to Scotch and Irish whiskey <span style="font-weight: bold">malt</span> is a specific reference to <span style="font-weight: bold">Malted Barley</span> only. No other grain is malted in the use of these whiskies. That's just for you information.<br /><br />In the use of solely plain barley and then amyless ... sure why not. I'd give it a go but if you want to make sure your on the righteous path I suppose the use of Malted Barley is the way to go but do you need to be putting all that extra expense on yourself.<br /><br />One of the big differences between bourbon, Irish &amp; Scotch is how they are matured. In the US whiskey states ye have very hot summers and very cold winters compared to us over here. So there is huge deep interaction with the wood and US whiksey matures quicker and takes on much more flavour from the wood. And the fact ye use first use oak makes a huge difference too.<br /><br />Over this side of the pond we use oak that already has been used to mature Bourbon so the wood is not as dominant as the bourbon has already taken out a lot of the dominant oak flavours. So the flavours take longer to extract for iriah and Scotch.<br /><br />But with the different climate over here this plays a key part also.<br /><br />In Scotland they have Mild Summers and very Cold winters. This means the whisky takes longer to mature which suits the stronger flavours of alot of the scotch distilleries.<br /><br />In Ireland we have Mild Summers and Mild Winters. This causes a slightly quick maturation than scotland but mellows out the whiskey more.<br /><br />So even if you have recreated the whiskey spirit spot on your maturation may be a key factor in getting it right or not. If you have a basement under the house it may be a way to go instead of using an out shed. Basically you'll want somewhere that is cool all year round.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you so much.<br /><br />I will save this thread as i do with the other info that has been fed to me.  Dave gave me thoughts on the water item. the burton salts are definitely out.<br /><br /> ifound a chart in Papazianz book about beer that gives the profile of waters in countrys where famous beers are made.<br /><br />The water in Ireland is yards softr than the  burton water so at this point the plain distilled looks best. I will compare the  profiles and consider doing just a fractional dose of the  burton salts.<br /><br />I will post the chrt as soon as i get it scanned.<br /><br />I cant tell you folk how  much your input has added to my desire to try and come close to making an Irish style ofwhiskey.  perhaps i should change my last  name from Scotto to McScotto <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>scotty wrote:</cite>So should this batch with the unmalted barley be called pot still whiskey</div></blockquote><br />Technically, if you made this in Ireland it could not even be called whiskey, because the law says the enzymes must come from malt included in the mash. Because malt is required, nobody has ever considered whether 100% barley is &quot;pot still&quot; or not. You are a pioneer <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>

I know that  burbons made in kentucky have  water similar to burton and folks claim the hard  mountain water is  necessary to duplicate the  burbon and the corn licker.<br /><br />Why I dont know. What you say sounds  more like the fact.??????</div>

				<div class="content">Here are some thoughts about the water profile. Whiskey is destilled in a pot still which does not give the  dozens of  distillations of the fractioning still used to make vodka. Many of the wash flavors are carried over in all whiskeys. Whiskey is about flavor during distilling  to a degree.<br /><br />When we finish  2 or 3 runs(( 3 with irish whiskey)) we end up with a 90 + % product that  must be diluted to bring the proof down. We use local water for the diluting process. So perhaps these two points may lead us to believe that the water profile does have some effect on the whiskey.<br />Half of the whiskey is at that point local water. <br />COMMENTS AND IDEAS PLEASE <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /> i'm trying to come up with enough unput/opinions or other information to decide which is  best<br /><br />1--distilled water for mashing and diluting<br />2--Distilled for  mashing and treated water for diluting<br />3-- treated water for  both---ill admit, that i'm leaning to this one <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
