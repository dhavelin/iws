				<div class="content">I have a few of the left and right ones in that photo. One of the ones in the CWS was mine too. I really would like the 10 but I'll eventually find on.  <br /><br />The society is planning a Redbreast tasting in the near future and I know some of them will be sampled. <br />Has anyone ever tried the blend? I liked it but it never took off. I bet it would be more successful if it were released today.</div>

				<div class="content">I have also made my experience with this problem, i faced it two times and i hope never again.<br />Once i fund a bottle and once i thought i have a bottle.<br />I was lucky that we changed the flat, so i had the chance to set up two list. One for the collection and one for the overload.<br />No bottle out and no bottle in too miss on your inventory list and i believe you have a correct overview.<br /> I know; it can be some work,but it is worth the time and patients.</div>
