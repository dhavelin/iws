				<div class="content">I think your on the wrong forum for that question. I advise you try the whisky magazine Forum. <br /><br />We love or Scottish whisky here too but they're better experienced to answer your questions.</div>

				<div class="content">I believe the Sherry would be far more valuable. <br /><br />The original version tended to be Sherry and they are very expensive now. The fine oak range (which is basically a fancy name for bourbon cask) was brought in as a cheaper version of the Sherry versions as they had low stock of older Sherry casks.<br /><br />If you saw a 30yo Sherry I believe we would be talking about thousands but it really depends on the year. The later the version by year the more expensive.<br /><br />So if you have a 30yo distilled in 1967 i.e. bottle in 1997 as opposed to say a version bottled this year so distilled in 1987 I think we would be talking huge differences in price.   <br /><br />Go to thewhiskeyexchange and see the differences between the 18yo Sherry and Fine Oak and you will get the idea of the difference.</div>
