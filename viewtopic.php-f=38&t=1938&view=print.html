				<div class="content">John Joyce (the father of James Joyce, author of Finnegan's Wake) was Company Secretary of the Phoenix Park Distillery.  He had a close connection with Robert Broadbent, proprietor of the nearby Mullingar Hotel.  A family history that I have read states the Robert Broadbent (who had some connections with Stalybridge) was responsible for the installation of the dynamos in the distillery.  Would any of your members be able to suggest a way in which I could confirm this statement?<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />Ken</div>

				<div class="content">a ken, the phoenix park distillery was set up by a company called &quot;Distillers Company Litd&quot;, who were funnily enough based in Scotland and who eventually evolved into United Distillers and then modern day Diageo. I've never seen any but, if they exist, any records about the early establishment of the PPD might be sought through those channels?</div>
