				<div class="content">A while back in conversation, you mentioned that in Turkey you saw  vodka infused with licorise. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">While preparing a bottle of potcheen for shipment out of the country, </span></span>i decided to dilute some and try infusing it with some fancy black licorise that i was  given for  christmas.<br />  I think i will like it as i have grown to enjoy the taste of the regular moonshine in orange  juice<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/VODKA/licoris.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hey, I'm a topic!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />It was Sweden, rather than Turkey, but yes. I got my hands on some Danish salty licorice a while ago and dissolved it in some poteen. I would drink it in a bar, I think, but somehow it's not what I crave at home <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Happy Christmas to you, Scotty!</div>

				<div class="content">Happy chritsmas to you too Dave.  I will wait a week or 2  to try it. 115 proof is a bit strong for me but i do actually find the taste without the licoris enjoyable.  I diluted it to 80 proof and made 1500 ml of irish cream with that. Then i took it to a party christmas eve and had them all singing italian songs in a short while. lol. Theywere going back for seconds and thirds.<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/VODKA/creams.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
