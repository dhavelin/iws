Possibly created in response to the great fuel shortages in the 70's. For many years it was mixed with Petrol that was sold in Ireland as part of a self sustaining industry and as a way to reduce our national imported fuel bill.<br /><br />This plant was closed well before 1989 and Cooley took over and converted it to a proper whiskey distillery in 1989.</div>

				<div class="content">Any processor of spuds would gladly sell the skins if they could. Few keep the skins on. (my family likes taters with the skin on, but that's us). Places that make frozen fries, tater tots, etc., peel the potatoes and do something with the peels.<br /><br />In the US we do something similar with corn - ethyl alcohol for motor fuel. This actually caused a feed corn shortage and increased prices. <br /><br />I've heard vodka called &quot;potato juice&quot;. Wonder if the peels could be turned into that?</div>

				<div class="content">Quite a few Vodkas on the market made from potatoes currently so yes it is not un-common. And I would imagine when they say made from potatoes that means potato skins as that is where you get most og the alcohol from.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm too lazy to look this up but something in the back of my head is saying that the state set up distilleries to use up rotten or blighted potatoes. Potatoes are a source of starch, just like grain. Starch is converted to sugar, sugar to alcohol. Back in the day, I can't imagine there were any industrial sources of potato peelings in the country. You bought your spuds with peel and muck included  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
