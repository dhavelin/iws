				<div class="content">Chill filtering came about because whiskey bottled at 40% would go cloudy with temperature drops. <br /><br />Basically in cold weather the fusil oils in whiskey would solidify and make the whiskey look cloudy therefor appearing unappetizing in many of the publics eyes and affecting sales.<br /><br />So the &quot;extra&quot; step of chill filtering was devised and introduced to prevent such occurrences.<br /><br />It was thought that the optimum abv to prevent this naturally  (i.e. NCF) was to bottle at 46%. However as Irish is distilled 3 times (therefor contains less heavy oils that Scorch distilled twice) I am presuming they can get away in bottling NCF at the lower abv of 43.2%.<br /><br />I have no issue paying for my extra 3.2% but are we yet again going to pay an over rated premium for another fairly standard Irish whiskey. Any mass produced whiskey in my book from 12yo down should be in the standard category.<br /><br />I totally welcome the the offering but I still ask the question what is this &quot;unique process&quot;. <br /><br />More like a marketing filtering process of my hard earned cash <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> .</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure how new this really is - there's been a Power NAS at 43.2% available outside of Ireland for a while now - I got a couple of bottles at some stage and they were definitely a step up from the regular. More SPS character if I recall. I'll have to give the bottle another go at the weekend.</div>

				<div class="content">I've got to the bottom of some of this. <br /><br />The 43.2% was launched into the U.S. as mentioned. It is NCF. The percentage isn't the reason. That's just to make it look more like a small batch with an irregular percentage. <br /><br />The new Three Swallow (not 3 Swallows I'm told) is 40% it's also NCF. The triple distillation helps but it is also filter but not chill filtered. <br /><br />I'm sure it's a new system but effective non the less. I tested a sample when I got it to be sure. I thought it was a higher ABV but found out later it was 40%. <br /><br />On another note sadly an increase of 3.2% in abv would not be a 3.2% increase in price. To bring it down from 43 to 40 you would add about 70ml water and gain roughly 2 measures. I'm guessing to leave it a 43.2 you'll lose those 2 measures and therefore for a 70cl bottle that could be 10% dearer. Maths a little confusing but makes sense if you work it out.</div>

				<div class="content">I can confirm the new version of the Powers Gold Label NAS is 40%. It is already on supermarket shelves here in Ireland and is designed to tie in with the 43.2% export version, three swallows, signature release, johns lane and the recent limited editions.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>John wrote:</cite>What's the difference between the Three Swallows and the Signature release?</div></blockquote><br /><br />They are completely different strangely enough. The Signature Release is First fill Bourbon &amp; Olorosa Sherry. The Three Swallow has a variety of Bourbon &amp; a small amount of Sherry. <br /><br />It's a good example of 2 different NAS whiskey from the same stable. The Three Swallow is spicier while the Signature is Fruitier I think. <br /><br />I wonder if they'll ever try a finish, it worked wonders with the Green Spot.</div>

Too many subtleties that  cause confusion and will evade the the average buyer; and that even makes me pause to think!
