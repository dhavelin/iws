				<div class="content">Good tough match ... possibly not the spectacle we were looking for but good hurling ... half time now and Tipp only 1 point ahead. I thought Kilkenny made a mistake by electing to play against a fairly strong wind and with King Henry off after 12 mins (No Miracle cure for him unfortunately) it was looking good for Tipp. However the Richie Power goal (a cracker) really changed the game and a strong last 5 mins for Kilkenny closed a 6point gap to 1. Can Tipp  keep the momentum going still a intriguing contest.</div>

				<div class="content">What a second half for Tipp ... played Kilkenny to a T and were very strong in Defence which is probably the main difference between Tipp and any other team to face Kilkenny. They won fair and square and won well and no on e can deny them an excellent win not even a case that Kilkenny were off form just that Tipp kept them at bay. <br /><br />A big weldone to Tipp ...</div>

				<div class="content">The one computor that the hotel has on site and it takes a nose dive after the match, well in fairness actually it was back this morning but I was over in Italy! Anyway, have to say fair play to Tipp. They played like a team posessed and their determination served them well. Absolute worthy winners and we have no-one to blame but ourselves <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />Well, we'll be waiting for them in the long grass next year, c'mon the one-in-a-row!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">Just another note-- thats a real tough game-<br />        I also am amazed at european football-- it is so much more interesting than USA football. I never  cease to be amazed at how those guys can  kick the ball to another player while running-<br />  I'm not  a sports fan in any way  but excellent is excellent.</div>
