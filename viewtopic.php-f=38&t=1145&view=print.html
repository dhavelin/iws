				<div class="content">I had to laugh he was saying if only he had known this before his last election things would have been a lot easier.<br /><br />Well he certainly has a very mixed lineage ... He can directly trace his great great great grandfather by a clear trail of documentation to Moneygal in Ireland which is actually more than Clinton, Regan and Nixon ever did but hey who needs proof when your a President (I talking about the three ex presidents now). They actually could go back as far as the 1700's. However he name his seemingly originated from the Flanders area (Belgium/ France area).<br /><br />Probably only popped in to shore up his Irish American vote and create a bit of Tourist hype for Ireland. other than that no reason to be here at all.<br /><br />Fair play to him though he went against Presidential protocol and had a pint that was not poured by the Secret Service  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <br />He cleared it too ....  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Cheers Mr O<br /><br /><img src="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/multimedia/dynamic/00601/OBAMA_GUINNESS_601786s.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
