				<div class="content">I know these are supermarket whiskeys but we can't get them in USA.  Would anyone be willing to purchase and ship them in exchange for purchase and shipment of whiskey only available in USA?  Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">I haven't seen Avoca in Aldi for a long time now. There isn't a Sainsbury's in (the Republic of) Ireland but I'd be surprised if they still had their own-label Irish whiskey. Supply of these private and retail label whiskeys was cut off when Beam bought Cooley.<br /><br />That said, there is still a bottle or two of M&amp;S Irish whiskey on their shelves so you might be lucky...</div>

				<div class="content">Avoca is now gone of the shelves in Aldi and has been replaced by Clontarf. It even has a bottled for Aldi on the back label.<br /><br />Further, the Irish postal system prohibits the sending of any liquids through the postal system now so it would be hard for any one in Ireland to post to you as they are getting very strict on it.<br /><br />So I fear you may be out of luck.<br /><br />The only option is hope a botle will appear in the WhiskyAuction.com auctions.<br /><br />Hope this helps</div>
