				<div class="content">Since no one else has done it, I thought it fair to mention another tasting that most missed - held November 16th 2011 in the Merrion Hotel (original details <a href="http://www.avvio.com/hotels/The_Merrion/bookings/client.php?nl4me=oRMJAv9RXszxNoJ9djPYDg" class="postlink">http://www.avvio.com/hotels/The_Merrion/bookings/client.php?nl4me=oRMJAv9RXszxNoJ9djPYDg</a> )<br />This was hosted by IDL's Kevin O'Gorman who is also based at Midleton and attended by ~50 people (only 3 of us Society regulars as far as I could see.)<br />The line-up was similar to the recent IDL-hosted tastings at Bow Street (<a href="http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/events/2011/2011-09-21" class="postlink">http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/events/2011/2011-09-21</a>) - Redbreast 12 and Redbreast 15, Green Spot, Powers John's Lane Release, Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy.  <br />Kevin did  superb job taking us through the whiskeys - I don't know how Midleton does it but it is producing a superb set of gentlemen who obviously know their stuff but also have the ability to hold a crowd's attention even after they've had a few!  It should go without saying that the whiskey was well appreciated.  This time around (its always different), I really liked the RB 15, but the Power's would be my &quot;value&quot; whiskey!<br /><br />Kevin also produced a few cask samples ... Now I like my port casks but the most stunning of the samples was a straightforward 1991 bourbon cask.  Not far behind was a 1998 sherry butt sample and two I really liked - the 1989 port cask (first 6 years in a B1 cask)and a 1998 Madeira cask (again 6 years in a B1).  To cap a perfect evening off, IDL presented each attendee with a bottle of RB12 - uncalled for but very much appreciated.<br /><br />As tastings go, this was up there with the best.  Another night to remember.<br /><br />Michael</div>

				<div class="content">Tried to get to that alright but I left it too late to book it and it was full. The organiser got back to me to tell me there was another one of those coming up at a later date but for the life of me I can't remember when.</div>
