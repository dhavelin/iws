Batch 0410J, £32 with a voucher from Waitrose - bargain. I opened it the day i bought it, couldn't resist.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes. April 2010 54.4%. It says this is the third batch which i didn't know that, so i've tried all three. I haven't tried the 48%. I'm not so keen on Glenlivet, apart from these, ncf and nc, you'll enjoy this one i think it's the best of the three ( on first impression ).</div>

				<div class="content">Lagavulin 16. Now, i must sat firstly that i like Lagavulin, the 12yo CS is a great dram, but i've seriously gone off the 16yo. Beneath the cloying e150 there is a great whisky, but is subdued and numbing. My living bottle ( that i am now drinking ) is far superior, and that shouldn't be the case.</div>

				<div class="content">I would have to agree with you that Lagavulin in the last few years has really lost a lot of it's big carachter &amp; now is more of a muted flavour however I'm not sure I go along with the E150 arguement. Such minute amounts are used and Toffee, Caramel and Vanilla as flavours are quite prevelent natural whisky flavours in the now main stay bourbon casks.</div>
