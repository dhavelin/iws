				<div class="content">most recent was a bottle of Penderyn, a present from someone in work who was over in wales visiting her parents, nice firey drop of whiskey.<br /><br />before that, maybe it's the CJD or maybe i've been drinking too much but I have no Idea what the last bottle i paid for was!<br /><br />since I buy most of my Whiskey in the celtic whiskey shop maybe you guys have a better idea!<br /><br />I know i picked up a bottle of redbreast but that was for my Da (for those following the saga from the other posts I couldnt get the Loch Lomond here and was too late to order it online and have it turn up in time for his birthday but thanks for the help....).<br /><br />I think it may have been the bottle of Jameson Signature Reserve that i Picked up when visiting friends in england, that is still sitting at home unopened, which may be a nice bottle for our next meeting....?<br /><br />as for the next bottle....</div>

				<div class="content">Been duty-free buying Scotches (sorry!)<br />I picked up a nice double of Glenfiddich for 60 euro in Charles de Gaulle (12 yo reserve and 15 yo Solera finish) and on my way back I grabbed a Lagavulin 17 yo and an Aberlour A Bunadh.<br />In my defence, I do have pretty much every Irish whiskey I want in the house already, and I did get given a Redbreast and a Green Spot to add to the Connemara Cask Strength I won at the Whiskey Tasting competition, so I didn't feel too bereft at turning my back on what were pretty poor selections of Irish whiskey in Paris, Mumbai and Schiphol airports.</div>

				<div class="content">I'll keep a sample for you if you like, Adrian.<br />I intend it as a winter dram, as I'm not normally a smoke freak.<br />But I did open and sample last night out of irresistible curiosity, and I have to say it came across with some amazing wine notes. I was getting raspberry crumble and cherry liqueur as well as the more expected tarry brine, wood ash and salt.<br />A genuinely big, bruising yet fascinating dram.</div>
