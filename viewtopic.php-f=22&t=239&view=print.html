				<div class="content">It's a good pub alright. That said, and I know this should probably a different discussion point, but I'd describe it more as a pub with a few decent whiskeys than a whiskey bar per say. The have the IDL premium whiskeys plinth and a couple of others but not much of real interest.<br /><br />I'm not sure this is a valid distinction, just a thought.</div>

I think the Porterhouse in Bray has a decent selection, but I haven't been there in quite a while.<br /><br />Frank Duffs in Bray would have a similar selection to the Leitrim above - again not maybe a whiskey bar but a bar with a decent selection. They'd have the IDL plinth, a couple of Bushmills, one or two Cooleys I think and the Diageo plinth. Maybe there's a Glenmorangie and a Glenlivet there too, but I'm not sure.</div>
