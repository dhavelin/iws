				<div class="content">Hi Clueless,<br /><br />Welcome and great question and what great idea, I am sure he will be delighted. I suppose we should first decipher if you know whether your husband has any favorites and ppossibly go from there?<br /><br />i.e. what does he drink currently and then maybe we can go up market from that to suggest something a bit more special.<br /><br />You don't even have to spend the €150 on the bottle but maybe get something around 80-100 euro mark and put in in a nice wooden box with 2 glasses. That is what we did for a couple we knew a while back a nice bottle of whiskey and vodka and some glasses and they were delighted as it was so different from the usual gifts. <br /><br />So from that point of view if he is a regular drinker what sort of glasses does he already use. Tumblers etc. If it is something you want to consider just let us know.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Adrian,<br />Thats a great idea, thank you. He doesn't have a favourite and would usually do a bit of research before buying a new bottle. On a special night out he would treat himself to something on the to shelf. <br />Is there a particular type you can recommend as being a little bit special??<br />Thanks again</div>

				<div class="content">Price is not always the key but the nicer ones do tend to cost a bit more but I had a peruse of the Celtic Whiskey Shop's website and the following is what I could come up with. All below 100Euro.<br /><br />Personally I would not bother with Midleton Very Rare and although it is a nice whiskey for me it is too much of an easy drinking whiskey and not especially interesting and a bit obvious.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/">http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/</a><!-- m -->  They have a Flat rate delivery of €7.95 anywhere on the island of Ireland no matter what you buy so even 2 bottles could be an idea.<br /><br />The Celtic Whiskey Shop in Dawson Street in Dublin currently has ...<br /><br />Green Spot Chateau Léoville Barton @  €69.99 quite limited and excellent by all means.<br /><br />Redbreast 15yo @ €97.00 a cracking whiskey and a constant favourite amonst whiskey drinkers<br /><br />Powers John's Lane Reserve 12 Year Old @ €63.99 this is also a cracker and very much a favourite of mine.<br /><br />Tyrconnell Madeira Finish @ 75.99 another very good whiskey but is bottom choice of my list.<br /><br />From what else I saw online I was not over hit by anything of outstanding quality. The only one I can't comment on is the Celtic Whiskey Shop - Celtic Cask Ceathair Deag (14) and @ €135 the most expensive of the list but I have no clue of this and how it tastes. others to consider also would be Jameson Gold or Jameson 18yo which are usually avialable widely.<br /><br />If your buying one of the cheaper ones above you might consider adding  second in a nice presentation box which you can easily do yourself. I would suggest with maybe 2 glencairn glasses as these are the glasses he can use to explore the whiskey. Tumblers are more for a relaxing drink by the fire.<br /><br />Teeling Single Malt @ €52.99 great value as it is really admired.<br /><br />Writers Tears Copper Pot @ €44.99 another middle end whiskey.<br /><br />And if you go for the Redbreast 15yo you could get him this book <br /><br />A Glass Apart: Irish Single Pot Still Whiskey  by Fionann O'Connor a wonderful book about Irish potstill whiskey.<br /><br />If Dublin based you could buy him a membership to the Irish Whiskey Society.<br /><br />I'm sure others will pop in here and give other ideas so remember it is all about personal taste and if you are unsure just go with your own gut feeling.<br /><br />I'm sure no matter what you get he will be delighted  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  Best of luck on the big day  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif" alt="bd)" title="Cheers" /></div>

				<div class="content">The Redbreast 15 is great whiskey. Bushmills 21 is another cracker that's under budget too. <br /><br />Writers Tears Cask strength is another great whiskey. <br /><br />Jameson Gold reserve is under €90 and I think it's a great blend. <br /><br />I'd totally agree with Adrian about the book to. It's a great read. My sister has borrowed mine, she's not interested in whiskey but the book is so much more than a whiskey book.</div>
