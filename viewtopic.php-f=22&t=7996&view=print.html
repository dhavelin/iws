				<div class="content">Hello All.  Stumbled across L Mulligan Whiskey Shop today.  I have seen L Mulligan Grocer and even own of bottle of their whiskey.  Is the shop new?  They have a good prices and a good selection, almost too good for a new place.  Is this place legit?  Also, the site was chock full of spelling and grammatical errors.  Par for the course for American writing, but I usually do not see this on Irish and British web sites.</div>

It is legit. Haven't seen the website but the proprietor and staff were very pleasant and helpful to me last week !  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif" alt="bd)" title="Cheers" /></div>

				<div class="content">Must stop the staff writing content whilst drinking whiskey!<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback, we are aware of it. We had an issue with our web builder spell checker, it was turned off making us think we were the greatest and fastest typists around. <br /><br />Anyone wants to fix it for some free hooch then please contact me or its going to be one of those January jobs!</div>
