				<h3>Reading Lot / Date Codes</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello.  I was wondering if there are any standard bottling codes on Irish whiskey bottles.  I don't have any rare or old bottles, so it's more of a curiosity.  Sometimes I hear people rave about a certain year even if it's a blend and then say recent bottlings are not as good.  Just wondering how to tell when something was bottled.<br /><br />For example, I have a bottle of Redbreast 12 that I just purchased at a great price (compared to most places anyway).  I love this stuff, but have heard a few people claim it's quality dropped off as it got more popular.  Code on the bottle says:  L316831148  14:24.<br /><br />I assume the 14:24 might imply 2014 and week 24 or something?  Anyone know?</div>

				<div class="content">The 14:24 is the time. I don't know why they don't just put the date properly on the bottle but that 3 after the L is the last digit of the year. So 2013 here.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks!  My first thought was a time stamp, but there never seems to be a standard to follow.  One of my favorite beers uses the year and then the day of the Julien calendar.  Who the hell would think of that!</div>

				<div class="content">Could this be an older bottling than 2013? I thought they were using 2 digits from 2010. Is yours a new label or old? <br /><br />I recently found some bottles in an off-licence that were L61803044 which put it at 2006, so I'm guessing there lots of places out there with old stock. I had bottles with both L1 and L0 for that year. They were Redbreast 15 but I assume the same stands?<br /><br />Your bottle of Redbreast 12 is L316831148. This could be <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span> for 2003 <span style="text-decoration: underline">168</span> is from the Julian Calender-<span style="text-decoration: underline">17 June </span>and the <span style="text-decoration: underline">31148</span> is the batch number I assume.</div>

				<div class="content">Interesting.  I'm not sure how the labels have changed over the years.  I purchased this bottle as a gift for someone getting into whiskey.  Since it was one of my favorites and the price was right, I decided to grab it.  There was only one bottle left and I kinda want to buy it for myself now.  I was holding out for the cask strength 12.<br /><br />I sent an e-mail to the company to see if they can decode it for me.  I'll share the response if I get one!</div>

				<div class="content">David was right about the L3 being for 2013, although it could be 2003 too. I just into a supermarket to check the new label Redbreast and it was L3.</div>

				<div class="content">Well the good folks at Irish Distillers were quick to return my e-mail.  Here is what they said about this date code:<br /><br />Hope this email finds you well. Regarding your code, please see below details:<br /><br />·         L = Lot Code<br /><br />·         3 = Year 2013<br /><br />·         168 = Julian date so 168 is June 17th<br /><br />·         3 = Code to identify the Bottling Plant, 3 is our bottling plant located in Waterford.<br /><br />·         1 = Bottling Line 1<br /><br />·         148 = Rotation of Vat Number i.e. how many batches the bottling plant will have processed that year in that particular holding vessel (Vat). Not only Redbreast but other spirits will have been held in that Vat throughout the year.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for posting this. I'm sure most people will have zero interest but I for one find it very interesting.<br /><br />If 3 stands for Waterford bottling plant, that Donohoes for any one interested. They usually do the Midletons and Dungourney and the like. <br /><br />Where is 1 &amp; 2?<br /><br />I'm guessing <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span></span> is Fox &amp; Geese in Dublin but where is <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span></span>?</div>
