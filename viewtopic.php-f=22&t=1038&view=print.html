				<div class="content">Well, being new to IWS - and to Bushmills - just want to ask for a candid opinion, please.<br />Has anyone tried the 21 year? It is almost impossible to get here in British Columbia, but I might be able to have some sent from Alberta. Only problem is, it costs over $200.00, and I wonder if it is worth that amount?<br />My favourite is the Black Bush, followed closely by the 10 year single malt, then the 16 year single malt. I have the 1608 400 Anniversary, but have yet to try it.<br />I am finding with nearly all of my whiskies that I normally prefer the younger ones, around 10 to 12 years, although I would spend the extra bucks on an older one if I thought it wortwhile. I guess that it would be really great to have the 21 year in my collection.<br />Anyway, it would be great to hear of any tasting reviews.<br />Cheers,<br />Carl</div>

				<div class="content">We tried the 21yo at an IWS tasting. I <a href="http://www.irishwhiskeynotes.com/2009/11/presidents-selection.html" class="postlink">wrote up my thoughts</a> afterwards so you can have a look at that.<br /><br />My own rough order of preference, from the top, would be: Bushmills 21yo, Bushmills 12yo Distillery Reserve, Bushmills 1608, Bushmills 16yo, Bushmills 10yo, Black Bush, Bushmills Original.</div>

				<div class="content">I always find price affects my appreciation of a whiskey. If I fork out big money for a whiskey I expect a big return on that whiskey. I've had the 21 on numerous occasions and I just cannot reconcile it to the price. There are very few expensive whiskies that I've had that I can go .. yes I'll definitely get another one of those.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong it is a really lovely whiskey and the Price point is actually pretty spot on for it's age (Here in Ireland anyway) but it is just not special enough for me to crack one open when I want to spoil myself. But I would pay the same money for the Millennium malt which can still be spotted around. Obviously if you feel that $200 is an acceptable out lay then go for it.</div>
