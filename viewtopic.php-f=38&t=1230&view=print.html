				<div class="content">Has anyone ever read the wikipedia articles on &quot;Irish Whiskey&quot; or &quot;Pure Pot Still&quot; whiskey? They're absolutely terrible and littered with crap like &quot;Pot still blends like greenspot vs single malts like bushmills.&quot; I suppose the PPS article shouldnt even exist as the names been changed for quite some time now but its been hijacked by editers who assume its an article about the theoretical use of a pot still at all and have gotten rid of any national or unmalted/malted mixture references. anyway, as i know the society is very interested in educating the public about irish whiskey and wikipedia is a hugely influential space, i thought i should bring it to your attention in case anyone has the time to go over there and do some clean up work.</div>

				<div class="content">ok so i've decided to bite the bullet and take care of this this week as i think its important to get real information into such a widely read resource if we're serious about educating the public. I've talked to some Wikipedia-buffs on the website about citation processes and editing etc and i think i've got them on board. If anyone wants to join in, feel free. Does anyone have any links to internet sites with information from historical sources. Nothing from IDL itself or any other corporate interest will work and, as happy as i'd be to quote alfred barnard etc, reliable references to these kinds of texts need to be dug up online for this to be done to last. cheers!</div>

				<div class="content">After a lot of wikipedia wading etc, i've at least set up a stub on Single Pot Still Whiskey and nominated the old &quot;Pure Pot Still Whiskey&quot; article (which was full of misinformed edits deleting any reference to mixed mash or ireland etc) for immediate deletion. The current stub doesnt have much info, but at least i can sleep knowing i've done my bit to get rid of the misinformation. If IDL's current bout of promotion keeps up, i'm sure people will begin checking that page and its good to at least give them the bare bones rather than nothing or, worse, what was there before. Any help or extra edits would be wonderful <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Pot_Still_Whiskey">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Pot_Still_Whiskey</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">oh! it's coming along rather well-- I'm coincidently finishing up the section about the demise of commercial distilling in Connacht tonight, goodness knows its been in the works long enough. Unfortunately, until i get back to Dublin in June i can't work on any of the really fun contemporary bits that involve excuses to drink.</div>

I'm only new to all these computer and stuff.<br /> I live in the sticks as they say,but i actually live about 2 and 1/2 miles after the sticks.
