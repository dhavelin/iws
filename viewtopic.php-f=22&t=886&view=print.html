Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't refuse an expensive Cognac but the original point of the site was to use blind taste tests to prove that some of the over priced products are just BS!

It's going to take some time.  We've been up for 2 months and I figure about a year from now will have a good stable of writers and enough articles to be almost a reference for each topic, i.e. reviews, top ten lists, events, recipes etc...<br /><br />Yes, we do shots of Powers all night in Philly!  All night!   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Thanks for the well wishes...</div>
