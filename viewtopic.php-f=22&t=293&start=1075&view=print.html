By itself the Quinta Ruban didn't do a lot for me but I suspect it may turn out to go very well with a cigar.</div>

				<div class="content">Been on a mini splurge in the last couple of weeks but nothing too exciting and all for personal consumption as is any purchase I make anymore.<br /><br />Regular Paddy for 20 yo-yo's, Locke's 8yo Lightly peated single malt. Glen Marnoch Islay edition from Aldi so will be interesting top see how this fares for €25.<br />A bottle of Bushmills Special Reserve (i.e. the short continuation of the Millenium reserve for Duty Free) and 2 x Black bush one from the 70's (Cork Top) and one from the 80's, thanks Whiskey Bro for letting me relieve you of them  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> . So will be tasting the 2 blackbush against the current version which is in my opinion half the whiskey it used to be but I shall proved right or wrong in the near future  <img src="images/smilies/icon_study.gif" alt="Bo)" title="Book" /> .</div>

				<div class="content">Just got my Tullamore dew 'Buena Vista' delivered by a friend who had it<br />delivered from the famous pub/restaurant of the same name on Fisherman's <br />Wharf. $28 for a 1 litre bottle with the equivalent 1 litre Standard Tullamore <br />dew costing 41 Euro  @ Tesco's. No attempt at a rip-off in that establishment.<br />The quantities they use every year in Irish Coffees are quite astonishing and<br />they have been doing it since 1952.</div>

				<div class="content">It's been a while so said I'd check back in.  Went on a bit of a splurge (by my own standards) over the last month while travelling through duty free shops.. Have only opened one of these so far, the Auchentoshan heartwood. Very disappointed in it and in my opinion a poor offering. I normally don't purchase bottles in excess of 80 euro but I picked up the Dair Gheaalach as it its from batch number 1 and that appealed to my ego <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Last night I tried for the first time 3 of Teelings offerings. They were in a &quot;Trinity&quot; pack at the airport, contained a single grain finished in wine casks/small batch finished in rum casks &amp; a single malt. Small batch was my favourite and I think these minature packs are a great way for people to try your product. <br /><br />Till next time.<br /><br />Sláinte</div>
