		</div><br /> Text to accompany engravings......<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The DUBLIN WHISKY DISTILLERY COMPANY (Limited),<br />Dublin.</span><br />THE Imperial Exchequer draws a larger revenue from whisky distilling than from any other source of commerce. In Ireland the annual output amounts to nearly twelve million gallons of whisky annually. That, therefore, whisky forms one of our leading industries cannot be doubted. It has been computed that nearly one million and a half of Her Majesty’s subjects derive their subsistence from this  industry. It is not our intention to write a scientific essay on whisky distilling; what we will endeavour to set out will be more a short “history of the trade” and its rapid development.<br />There are about thirty large and well-known distilleries of whisky in Ireland, but the space at our disposal will not permit us to mention more than the one Firm whose name is associated with this article. The Jones Road Distillery is situated in one of the picturesque suburbs of Dublin.<br />The distillery itself is one of the most modern in Dublin, but the ground on which it is built, as well as its immediate surroundings, are full of historic interest. Although the River Tolka flows actually through the grounds of the distillery, its water is mainly used for driving-power, the water for distilling purposes being brought through pipes from the Royal Canal. The distillery buildings are most imposing, constructed of red brick about 65 feet high. The chimney, a handsome ornamental structure, about 140 feet high, is also built of red brick. The internal arrangements are carried out on the most modern and approved principles. The “plunger pump,” built by Messrs. Pearn &amp; Co., of Manchester, is one of the finest specimens of hydraulic machinery; it is capable of raising some 1,000 gallons of water a minute. Another remarkable feature in this distillery is a “Leffel Turbine Wheel” fixed in the middle of the stream of the River Tolka, with a water-power equal to 40 horse-power. This wheel is the only one in use in any distillery in Ireland. They have also recently erected a Canadian windmill of the most modern<br />construction of its kind, and this revived specimen of inexpensive power has already given much satisfaction to the Company.<br />The large maltings of this distillery are situated in Russell Place to the approved plans,and form a stately pile of well-arranged, convenient buildings. A very large number of hands are employed in this distillery. The Company have just erected large bonded warehouses on an adjoining estate lately purchased by them. Messrs. George John Alexander, Matthew H. Chamberlain, James Costello, William H. Maturin, and O.T. Allingham are the present directors of the Company. The following are views of the new concrete warehouses:—<br />The business of the Dublin Whisky Distillery Company extends all over the world. Their present output is over 600,000 gallons annually, and their trade in England, India, and the Colonies, is daily increasing. The illustration on previous page is the well-known trade-mark of the Company.<br />This Company is in every way worthy to rank as one of our leading distilleries for Irish whisky, and by comparison of the qualities of their distillations with those of older firms, it will be found that nothing remains to be desired in the perfection in which the D.W.D. whisky is placed before the consumers. Indeed, a feature justly claimed for the quality of this whisky is that in mellowness and softness of flavour it is, when properly matured, the nearest justly claimed for the quality of this whisky is that in mellowness and softness of flavour it is, when properly matured, the nearest approach to old brandy of any spirit manufactured, whilst, as a wholesome beverage and stimulant, it ranks higher than the best brandy. The London Agents are the well-known and highly-esteemed Firm of Messrs. Butcher &amp; Robinson, 11, Great Tower Street, City.</div>
