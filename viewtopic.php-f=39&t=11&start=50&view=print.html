				<div class="content">Hello all,<br /><br />   My name is SixCats! (aka Tom Patrick).  I originally hail from &quot;The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations&quot; aka Rhode Island (USA).  Both my Grandparents (on my Dad's side) were from Ireland.  In my youth, I have lived (briefly) in the States of Texas, Alabama, New Jersey.  As an adult, I spent a total of twenty one years between (Los Angeles) California and (Nashville) Tennessee.  I presently reside in the beautiful State of Maine since the Spring of 1999.  In my past, I have been a (SAG) Actor and Vocalist.  I am presently employed as a <br />&quot;Direct Care Professional&quot; working with &quot;Special Needs&quot; Adults.  I much prefer living in the Country in Maine <br />(as opposed to the City).  My wife ( my High School Sweetheart) and I live in a small Town,<br />(pop. three thousand) located forty five miles North of Portland, Maine.  We very much enjoy the peace and quite of the Country.  We enjoy seeing Animals such as Fox, Wild Turkey, Raccoon, Deer, Moose, BobCat, American Bald Eagle, etc. I have had many hobbies/interest over the years.  Aside from collecting Cats (had seven, now four) I have collect (and have amassed) too much Home Audio gear (mostly Vintage/Classic).  My &quot;pride &amp; joy&quot; is a rare/circa 1950's (Charles Eames designed) Stephens Tru-Sonic Mono Horn Speaker (175 lbs.) which I use a vintage PILOT AA-903B (EL-84) Mono Tube Amp of fourteen watts.  This combo sounds AWESOME!  I mostly enjoy listening to Classic Jazz, Blues, light Classical.  I also (if time permits) enjoy Archery/Deer hunting in the Autumn season.<br />Of late (considering the World situation) I decided I'd benefit (read mellow out) by enjoying some &quot;Spirits&quot;.  I've mostly been a &quot;Beer/Wine&quot; guy.  I have become completely OBSESSIVE researching Irish Whiskey and Scotch Whisky.  I spend waaaaaay too many hours on the computer, making lists of peoples reviews/ratings/likes/dislikes/etc.  After much research, my first bottle purchase was REDBREAST.  An EX-cellent first choice me thinks!  I LOVE it!  I've already finished one Redbreast as well as one bottle of Powers Gold label.  I now have begun to collect (read Squirrel away) several bottles of Spirits for Maine's long Winter (I believe it's called prior planning).  Presently have in reserve, two REDBREAST, one &quot;The Irishman Original Clan&quot; (aka 70) one Jameson 12, one Highland Park 12 and one ARDBEG 10.  I've yet to taste any of these I have in storage, I hope I can wait until Fall!<br />In addition, I have (opened) BLACK BUSH, &quot;THE FAMOUS GROUSE GOLD RESERVE&quot; and TITO's Vodka.  All quite good!  I plan on purchasing a select FEW more &quot;higher end&quot; Scotch and Irish (something on the order of Lagavulin 16, Talisker 18, Highland Park 18 for Scotch) and Commemara, REDBREAST 15 for Irish Whiskey (when available to the US).  That being said, I plan to seek out more &quot;modest&quot; priced Spirits as daily drinkers.  I tried a NIP of BUSHMILL ORIGINAL and I rather like it especially considering it's twenty dollar (or thereabouts) price.  I found Powers Gold label is also a pretty good dram for the same price.  A lovely (lighter) tasting Scotch is TAMDHU 10 also at the twenty dollar price point.  At Heart, I'm a &quot;bargain&quot; hunter so, I'll be searching the &quot;most-est for the least-est&quot; Irish &amp; Scotch Whiskies.  I don't know if Bushmill Original can be beat for it modest cost.  I'm open to suggestions!  Thanks all.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats! aka Tom Patrick</div>

				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br /><br />   Thanks for the warm welcome.  WhiskeyBro, yes indeed Sir!  I've already purchased and have opened my first bottle of BUSH BLACK.  BB cost $31.00 in my neighboring State of NH (more in Maine).  I am enjoying BB and I know BB is a more...ROBUST dram than Bushmill Original but, it is still twelve dollars more a bottle than BB here in my neck of the woods.  No problem, I have little doubt that I'll keep one (or more) of each on hand.  While I AM enjoying BB, REDBREAST is still first in my Heart!  Then again, REDBREAST cost $12.00 more than BB.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats! aka Tom Patrick</div>
