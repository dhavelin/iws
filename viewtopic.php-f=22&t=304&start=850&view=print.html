The stills must be silent 90% of the time. This is the Hungarian model that Zoltan told us about - the locals grow their fruit and get the local palinka distillery to distil it.</div>

Given the rising interest in Irish whiskey and micro distilling, it might be worth mentioning at least the idea to them.</div>

				<div class="content">Shouldn't really be having whiskey as I'm off work with the &quot;manflu&quot;. That said my throat was so sore I couldn't talk so I decided to anaesthetise it with some Japanese whisky so I've had a Nikka Coffey Malt, From the Barrell and Taketsuru 17yo vatted malt.<br /><br />The From the Barrell is really heavy and rich for a blend - this is becoming a regular though as it's a 500ml bottle it may not be for long.<br /><br />Coffee malt a revelation - not like any column distilled whisky I've tried before - hard to tell apart from a heavily sherried pot still malt.<br /><br />Taketsuru very like a Scottish sherry monster. Most Japanese whiskys I've tasted (which I'll admit is very few) are quite distinct from Scotch SM's but this reminds me a bit of something like a Blue Hanger or other sherried vatted malt.</div>

				<div class="content">There's the remains of a bottle of Lockes single Pot Still Malt, The limited edition of 5000. I noticed the scroll was signed by John Teeling. I bet that was a memorable day for him. <br /> I guess I've increased their value if anyone is collecting them.<br /><br />I've also a small amount of Woodford Reserve Bourbon to finish. I really like this stuff. There is no age statement on it but it's got a presence about it that i never found in American whiskey before. Has really encouraged me to explore more Bourbons.<br /><br />If anyone has suggestions, please send them on.</div>
