In the same way as the dominance of Scotch blends has kept many a malt distillery alive, I think the phenomenal growth of Jameson is what has ultimately allowed the much wider range we see now. Plus if you can produce 2500 Barry Crocketts to travel the world conducting tastings you're bound to sell a few whiskeys. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Messing aside I think that might be the thinking behind the contraction in the Bushmills range of late. Get behind one or two core products, ramp up production, and in time the rest can follow. The problem with whiskey is the lead in time is so long you get years of waiting by frustrated enthusiasts but there's really no way around this for a product thta has to be aged for years at a time.</div>

Diageo have had 6 full years so far in charge. I know they put in new equipment during that time but perhaps they had spare capacity at takeover and could move to 24/7 production right from the start. In which case, we might see something in a year or two.<br /><br />For the enthusiasts, though, it's not so hard to push out a few single casks or limited releases. They could have had plenty of buzz going on the whiskey circuit just by doing that.</div>

				<div class="content">DavidH and IainB,<br /><br />I'm also wondering when we will see the big push from Bushmills.  Mrs. Booze took a tour of the distillery many years ago when it was a sleepy operation that didn't fire up the stills every day.  Now they are a 24/7 place like New Midleton, or so I hear.  They also are cutting out the Angel's Share:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.irishwhiskeynotes.com/2008/07/whiskey-miscellany.html">http://www.irishwhiskeynotes.com/2008/0 ... llany.html</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2008-11/cheating-angels">http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2 ... ing-angels</a><!-- m --><br /><br />So with all that extra inventory I have yet to see much advertising for Bushmills here in the states.  Maybe they are pushing big in China?  All that inventory has to go somewhere.  Diageo is pushing big in China:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703864204576321071234465158.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142 ... 65158.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Sorry to drag this off the SPS topic.  Relatedly I can report that the cask strength Redbreast is now alongside the 12 and 15 year here in America.  So technically now there are 3 separate SPS bottlings in the states.  All Redbreast variants.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Powers SPS came Stateside if the Redbreast moves well enough.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>They may be serving the purpose of enhancing the overall brand.</div></blockquote><br />The &quot;halo effect&quot;. But they are not really the same brand. Can a Redbreast SPS ever lend cachet to Jameson? That's quite a marketing job to get consumers to realise it's the same distillery and much the same spirit in both.<br /><br />There is quite a large Jameson range at this point, all blends, the idea being to give drinkers a Jemmy at every price point and level of sophistication. But they must be wondering now if there is a place for an SPS in the Reserve range. That way a Jemmy drinker could trade up to a Jameson SPS, then across to a Redbreast / Powers / Greenspot SPS.</div>

				<div class="content">coincidently, I just forwarded the above newsetter to leo and zoltan from my old boss at Diageo, so it is getting read by the exec types in these companies. As for bushmills, diageo put a lot of money in advertising at various events in the states etc-- making sure the whole line up could be poured like there were infinite reserves at whiskyfest, whiskylive etc. I've also seen billboards for the bushmills blend in the states where i never had before (especially in boston). The line i always heard in regards to production was that they need to &quot;build the brand&quot;... hopefully that info's of some use</div>

				<div class="content">John-- i'd heard that on the forum and found it surprising and a little sad, because i've been at whiskylive events in the states and bushmills always have a strong presence, even sponsoring a pipeband to come in blasting wave after wave of eardrum cracking publicity. but they also fuel the thing with plenty of actual product and i was always encouraged strongly to stress the single malt line over the white label... What did they bring to/do at the dublin whiskyfest?</div>

I wonder would they consider Bushmills as some kind of annual release like their Classic Range in Scotland. <br /><br />The Celtic Whiskey Shop were involved in some kind of blind tasting and White Bush did very well.

Who wants to drink an Irish whiskey that the Irish don't drink? I know Tullamore Dew pulled off that trick but the more mobile the global consumer becomes, the less that is going to work. There needs to be a distillery to vsit and a brand presence in the home country, I feel.</div>
