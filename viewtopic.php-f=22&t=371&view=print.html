				<div class="content">Look forward to an update on prices and availability... you have to pick up a bottle of Asda's own Cooley Irish Whiskey, I love the label <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Even after the VAT changes north and south I'd guess the difference is still 35%+ and thats before those tempting special offers. last visit I just bought those fine whiskies on special deals - unbeatable unpatriotic savings  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">A detour to the nearest Sainsbury's is also worth it, though I don't think there is one in Enniskillen. But generally they have a good selection of Scotch and Irish.. cheers<br /><br />Checkout <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk">www.mysupermarket.co.uk</a><!-- w --> before you head up for the latest info</div>

Asda &amp; Tesco in Enniskillen reckon at least 40% of their custom comers from south of the border  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  .<br /><br />The Irish gov droped duty on Spirits by €2.76 a bottle for an average 40% 70cl bottle. This was supposed to be a way of trying to even things up but Prices are still at a variance I think. <br /><br />Also Asda in Enniskillen has I think the 3rd highest turnover of Asda stores in the UK eventhough it is not in any way one of their bigger stores  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  .</div>

				<div class="content">My favourite sports chant of all time, as last heard in Croke Park in around 1994, is 'Up Down!'<br />One Belfast etymology for the 'Mexicans' tag is that is described people south of the border who are drunk and lazy. I've often felt that to be a bit of a slur on the good people of Mexico, who tend to be neither.<br />Plus, it fails as an analogy in that it posits the North as the United States which is risible on too many levels.<br />It's a nasty term, friendly to no one. Not one I like to use, myself.</div>
