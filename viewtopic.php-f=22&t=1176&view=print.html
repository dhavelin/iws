				<div class="content">Hello folks,<br /><br />I am a newbie, so nice to join this forum.  I am hoping you can help me.<br /><br />I am searching for a &quot;Whiskeys of Ireland&quot; wooden stand which you would normally see in pubs here in Ireland.<br />From memory I think it holds 5 bottles and Midleton is in the middle! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Anyone got any ideas?  I have tried the online distillery shops but nothing is showing up there.<br />Any ideas welcome! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Its for a birthday pressie for a big &quot;whiskey lover&quot; <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Zena</div>

				<div class="content">It's been a while since I was there but I thought I saw one at the Old Jameson Distillery in Bow Street.  In their online shop they are selling one which just holds 3 bottles of Jameson .... could be worthwhile phoning them to see if they have what you're looking for</div>

				<div class="content">There's 2 varients out at the moment. One you can buy online from Jameson here:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://shop.jamesonwhiskey.com/p-32-jameson-3-bottle-plinth.aspx">https://shop.jamesonwhiskey.com/p-32-ja ... linth.aspx</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There's also a 6 bottle version of this with Midleton VR, Power 12 and Redbreast 12, though I haven't seen it for sale anywhere.<br /><br />There were various older wooden versions back from when IDL owned bushmills - I have one with Jameson 12, Redbreast 12, Powers 12, Midleton, Bushmills 10 and Bushmills 16. There was also an older one with 5 bottles. You will sometimes see these in pubs and off licences around the place, for example Next Door in Wicklow as Zoltan mentioned, but I'd imagine it would be hard to get them to part with them at this stage.<br /><br />If you're not planning on spending a fortune or buying the whiskey that 3 bottle plinth might be a good bet - it actually looks a lot nicer in real life than it does on the photo. Also, if it's whiskey gifts you're after, there's a few other thing on that Jameson site that might be of interest.</div>

				<div class="content">Of course, depending on the whiskey the person you're buying for drinks, there are various other plinths knocing around.<br /><br />If you're anywhere near Kilbeggan, the distillery shop there has one for Connemara, Lockes and Tyrconnell. <br /><br />I think there's a Tullamore dew one too but unless you're buying for a German that's probably of little interest! <br /><br />There's a new one with pot still whiskeys.  <br /><br />But i think this is what you're looking for:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.irishflorists.com/Products_Details.asp?sz=Small&amp;Id=412">http://www.irishflorists.com/Products_D ... all&amp;Id=412</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I've no idea if they actually have this in stock.</div>

It is €165 for the bottle but the beauty of this bottle is that it comes in a really heavy wooden box and has it's own mini (Single Bottle) plinth with in so he can display it if he likes and use it for any other Midleton also. Just an idea.</div>
