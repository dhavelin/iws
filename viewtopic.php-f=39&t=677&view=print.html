Each topic was clearly defined and the general layout offered a broad spectrum of headings which could be used to good effect in finding specific information. Under the current layout, the topics are more vague and you have to go trawling for specific topics.<br /><br />John.</div>

I can offer some justifications for trying this new, simpler structure:<br /><ul><li>We have not managed to attract a critical mass of users. While quite a few IWS members signed up, many never returned. One complaint was that it was too hard to figure out what was going on, where the conversations were. It's telling that there is no discussion here after our monthly tastings. The complexity has now been addressed. We shall see if members are enticed back.</li><li>More generally, forum software is designed to show current conversations at the top and let older topics fade away. It's not meant as a static repository of information that can be browsed through in a hierarchical fashion. There should be very few &quot;stickies&quot; and plenty of conversations that are &quot;of the moment&quot;.</li><li>For the most part, old threads should be hidden but there is a powerful search function for finding information in those threads should the need arise.</li><li>In the old structure, even experienced forum users were posting threads in the wrong places. I used to move threads but I don't want spend time on this. The new structure is self-maintaining to a greater degree.</li><li>I am one of those forum users who always accesses the forum via the &quot;View New Posts&quot; link. I don't even see a difference between the old and new structures. I suggest people make more use of this feature.</li></ul></div>

Most people I know use multiple windows rather than even the tabs feature as it is easier to use and navigate so I cannot see this as a negative.<br /><br />Further you'd be amazed at the number of people who are not savy with key short cuts like how to launch a link in a new window.<br /><br />At the end of the day you want people to remain on your site for as long as possible but if they launch a link and it opens in the current window and then close out of it instead or going back a page we may potentially loose any further interaction if they decide to call it a day rather that going to the bother of signing back in. The majority of sites I know use auto launch for links.</div>

				<div class="content">Any respectable book or site dedicated to web usability will explain the very good reasons to leave the choice with the user (<a href="http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/beware-opening-links-new-window" class="postlink">example</a>). It's the spammy websites that try to keep their page open at all costs.<br /><br />As I said, this way the user has the choice (they can right-click on a link and open in a new tab or window if they don't know the Ctrl-click trick). What you want is supported by your browser.<br /><br />I'll add it as a &quot;tip&quot;.</div>
