				<h3>Jameson Limited Edition</h3>

				<div class="content">Was doing a bit of deep google-ing tonight on &quot;Irish Whiskey&quot; i.e. going further that just the first 3 search results pages  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />Anyway came across a Limited edition regular Jameson which I'm not sure if I've seen before. Specially created for St Patricks Day 2009 and brough back by popular demand for St Patrick's Day 2010c in the US. Possibly other countries too ...????<br /><br />I thought I came across an ALuminium casing for a regular Jameson bottle similar to this before where the bottle popped into it through the bottom where it was sealed in with a lid. Basicall a  snugly fitting canister in the shape of the bottle however this actually looks like a propper bottle with screw cap.<br /><br />So is it a propperly dressed up bottle or just a canister???<br /><br />Any one know any more about this ???<br /><br />The second pic looks like the Canister type I was talking about but the first pic looks like it's a bottle. Is there a difference or just a distortion of the pics.<br /><br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Hi there IWS,<br /> <br />I have one of these, which if i recall correctly was first released for St Patricks Day 2008 in the UK market...<br /><br />I would describe it as a outer skin on a jameson bottle...</div>

				<div class="content">This as I have been told by the learned people here is a skin (canister) so thanks for the clarification guys. However I have found out an interesting tit bit on this, this was not Jameson endorsed promotional tin and was the creation of either the UK importer or distributor (not sure which). Jameson are not keen to promote Jameson on St Patricks day as it may lead to a stereo typical association to the &quot;Drinking Irish&quot; which they have desperately been trying to avoid. This I feel is admirable as the whole Paddy's day and a sudden interest in whiskey annoys me too. However the St Patricks day skin has been a very sucessful adition to the bottle and possibly Jameson may have another look at this sort of strategy.</div>
