				<div class="content">I recently acquired an old bottle of Irish whiskey bottled under the Averys name for the US market. I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on it such as what distillery it might be from. I believe it was bottled around 1960 and the label says Averys at the top then has a picture of a sailing ship. Underneath it says &quot;Esquin's private selection supreme Irish Whiskey. 14 years old. bottled and exported by Averys of Bristol. 4/5 quart 86 proof. Any information would be very much appreciated.  I know Averys did a number from Bow street, but those where labled John Jameson below the Averys name.</div>

I've seen the two at those links before and find the hand written DWD intriguing (first link).  I am fairly certain that if it was Bow street they'd have said so given the Jameson name draws a great deal of water.  There was an 18y.o. sold by the same seller at the same time, I wasn't successful in that auction, but it said Jameson on the label and was bottled for the same merchant at about the same time.  I have asked Averys and they are doing what they can for me.  The investigation continues...</div>

I'm quite sure the date on my 14 y.o. is 1960 though, are you referring to the same one?  If you are how did you find out?  I really do want to know where it came from, I'd start water boarding people, but I don't yet know who to subject to that treatment (call me the whisky finder general).  I'm not so concerned about value, I'm enjoying the puzzle.  If it is the same bottle I suppose there are six possible distilleries as I would expect them to have said if it was malt or a blend.  I'd then take Jameson off that list for the reasons I give above so that's five.</div>
