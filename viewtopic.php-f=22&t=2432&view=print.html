				<div class="content">Bought a new bottling of Crested Ten that tasted much sweeter than of old, and not to its advantage. <br />Question: Is something happening to this whiskey?  Or is it me growing sour in taste with passing years,since I have already noted this drift to sweetness in Greenspot?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ken,<br /><br />Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. I thought I was the only one who noticed this sweetness! I was drinking a Crested over Christmas and thought the same. The Green Spot is remarkable different to the older ones. <br />I was sipping a Powers from the 80's and it's much more robust than the current version. Even Tullamore is at it.</div>

				<div class="content">Many thanks William! <br />This has prompted the thought that we should have a Benchmark Tasting in the IWS where we will taste and compare current  and older bottlings of our Irish whiskeys.  We really need to track <span style="text-decoration: underline">and record</span> how our whiskeys are changing (being changed) - not necessarily for the better.<br />To provide impetus to this suggestion I am happy to make available an older Green Spot (2008) and a Redbreast Pure Pot Still (2010); I don't have an older Crested Ten or Powers or Black Bush.<br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_study.gif" alt="Bo)" title="Book" /></div>
