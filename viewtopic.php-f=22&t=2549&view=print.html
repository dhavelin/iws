				<div class="content">The Bushmills Distillery (I believe) technically never produced any grain whiskey. And never produced Pot Still to my knowledge, they have always been famous for their single malt.<br /><br />However in the 1930's it bought the Coleraine Malt Distillery which was silent at the time and got it back up and running.<br /><br />After the Second world war Scotch blends be dominant and into fashion in the state in a big way so in the 50's it was decided to install a Patent Coffey Still in the Coleraine Distillery. They used this grain for both Coleraine and Bushmills blends. Coleraine stopped producing Malt in the 60's but continued to produce Grain whiskey until well into the late 70's but eventually ceased as they had become part of IDG (Irish Distillers Group) or IDL (Irish Distillers Ltd or Midleton) as they are known as today. It was simply down to scale, Coleraine was not suitable for expansion at the time and Midleton was and that hearlded the death knell for Coleraine but Bushmills survived on back of their renown.<br /><br />I believe they still have a contract with IDL to this day for their grain, which is fully matured in Bushmills.</div>

				<div class="content">If you have an interest in Bushmills there are 2 excellent books which might be of interest to you.<br /><br />The latest on is by Peter Mulryan and is called Bushmills - 400 years in the Making  (Published 2008)<br /><br />There is another which has loads of intriguing local and historical information on Bushmills.<br /><br />Spirit of the Age The Story of Old Bushmills by Alf McCreary (Published 1983)<br /><br />both well worth the read and you probably could pick up both fairly cheaply if you do plenty of online research.</div>
