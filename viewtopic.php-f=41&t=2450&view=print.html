				<div class="content">Looking for a valuation on this bottle that has been in my family for years.  Bottled in 1975.  Distilled in 1953.  Very rare, but unsure as to a value.  <br /><br />I would attach a photo but it says board attachment quota has been reached.<br /><br />Thank you</div>

				<div class="content">I've never seen or heard of that one. The only one I knew of was the Malt 8 year that was produced in Midleton. <br /><br />I'm have problems uploading photos lately too. I send you a message with my email and I'll try post it with my old computer.</div>

				<div class="content">This would be very valuable, I think. Someone may correct me on this but there may have been two older versions in the past. I have seen pictures of at least one of them. I will try to fish it out.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, there was also a 6yr that was an import only by the same import company. It was only exported to the U.S. under this brand name.  I'm not sure where the 22yr was distilled because it appears that maybe the Midleton distillery started years after 1953.<br /><br />Thank you everyone for your help.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree that it certainly would be a rare item. May be a further clue on <br />label or bottle shape as to what distillery produced. As for Midleton it's <br />around since 1825 with the new one coming on stream in 1975 <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />As far as my records show there were three bottlings of &quot;Erin Go Bragh Unblended Pot Still Malt Whiskey&quot; all were bottled at 40% abc and Imported into the U.S. by John Gross &amp; Co. Baltimore Maryland. They were supplied by Stuart McNair &amp; Co. Glasgow. There is also the more common6yo is from Midleton, the others are only attributed to Midleton because of that.<br /><br />They were also responsible for the &quot;Erin Go Bragh Single Malt Irish Whiskey 6yo&quot; bottled in 1997.<br /><br />1. 20yo d.1967 b.1987<br />2. 22yo d.1963 b.1985<br />3. 22yo d.1953 b.1975<br /><br />Numbers 2 &amp; 3 are featured in Valentino Zagatti's book.<br /><br />In terms of value, imho a collector might pay upwards of â‚¬250, if they were attributable to a distillery that could be double.<br />Insurance/ Specialist retail prices would be double that again.</div>
