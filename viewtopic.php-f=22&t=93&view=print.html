				<div class="content">Not sure JC, but I was aware of 2 which did not ever go anywhere.<br /><br />One had a working title of <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Willbrook</span></span> for which I came across a Home page yonks ago but there was no info on it. May well of been the Galway one but just a guess. However I think Willbrook is in Co Clare.<br /><br />The other which seemed more forward in planning was called <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Coola Mills</span></span>. This was going to go on a site just 1 km north of Lockes Kilbeggan distillery on the site of a ruined mill on the river brusna. I have a basic whiskey investment prospectus for this but again it never took off the ground. I think they were asking too much for the whiskey futures. Again had a website but alas gone now.<br /><br />€3,750 per cask of whiskey  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> (Unless the price was out of bond which I very much doubt)<br /><br />or €1,800 cask if you bought 12 or more.<br /><br />Not really inviting or maybe the just wanted big investors.<br /><br /><br />Does anybody have an update on the Dingle Distillery?</div>

				<div class="content">Re Dingle, the last I heard was that they had the distilling licence and were awaiting the planning for the refurbishment of the creamery. They've got the cash and the expertise to do it - the question is whether the economic climate might have dented their drive to push on at all.<br />Perhaps some of the Porterhouse lads might attend the next IWS meeting and give us an update.<br />Cheers for the info on the distilleries that never were, Adrian. I think it's useful for the society to collate information like that.</div>

It was to be a single malt distillery. They had a location and water source etc but nothing came of it. I believe David might have been in contact recently. The plan has been shelved for the moment anyway. <br /><br />Coola Mills just seemed to disappear into thin air. Nobody has heard much from the man involved. They used to have a website etc, but that's gone. I think the man involved was previously involved with the Kilbeggan distillery.</div>
