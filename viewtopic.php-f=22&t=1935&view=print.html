				<div class="content">This is an article about &quot;Cleveland&quot; whiskey, which is artificially aged in a week.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/05/02/180661986/how-a-distillery-ages-bourbon-in-days-not-years">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/0 ... -not-years</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'd like to try it, to make my own mind up, but I can't help thinking the big players are inviting this by eschewing age statements. If it doesn't say how old it is on the bottle then a whiskey aged for a week looks the same as a whiskey aged for, say, 5 years.</div>

				<div class="content">Well spotted !! One part of the article says it all for me <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">'Small distillers are always looking for ways to get their product to <br />market fast,&quot; says Frank Coleman, senior vice president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, who notes that the <br />number of small distillers has doubled over the past three years. &quot;There's definitely a gold-rush mentality right now.&quot;</span></span><br />The Gold Rush description could be quite apt seeing that it was an era where there were no regulations bar a well oiled Smith<br />&amp; Wesson or Colt !!! Personally I have my mind made up on this particular process. My lawnmower would love to try it as a substitute<br />for a 40 to 1 mix !!</div>
