				<div class="content">Explain this for a price difference this week :<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tesco:</span> Black Bush @ 32.06 &amp; White Bush dearer @ 35.85<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Dunnes: </span>Black Bush @ 31.50 &amp; White Bush @ 29.50<br />Dunnes win on both counts but this is the first time I have ever <br />seen Black Bush retailing cheaper than the White and by a whopping <br />3 Euros. I know Black Bush is not as good as it used to be since joining <br />the Diageo stable but surely not this far ! In general since Christmas <br />Irish whiskey prices are going up disproportionately to both inflation <br />and recent Revenue increases.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm amazed by the prices for white Bushmills. I saw it on offer at €22 in SuperValu this week and didn't think to mention it here because that sounded like full price to me. Apparently it is being sold for much more though.<br /><br />I noticed in Pernod Ricard's half-year results yesterday that Jameson sales growth once again outpaced volume growth. So maybe price rises are happening globally, not just in Ireland.</div>

				<div class="content">I was in Dunnes earlier and seen the White was€27.50 &amp; the Black was €31.70. I was in Tesco yesterday and noticed the 1 ltr White was €32+. They didn't have any 70cl ones left. <br />It's still too dear compared to other leading brands.</div>

				<div class="content">I snapped a pic in Tesco on Friday. Confirms that full price for Bushmills Original, 70cl, is €35.85. On sale at €21 though (someone mucked up the maths on this label because that's a saving of €14.85; it's correct online).<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

As for Black and White Bush here...pricing is Can$30.95 for the white, and Can $37.45 for the black.  I haven't followed the white to know, but I believe both prices have stayed (knock on wood) relatively flat for the past three years that I have been keeping track of such things.  Maybe a 50 cent mark-up on the Black Bush in that time.<br /><br />Comparitively, Redbreast 12 has shot up (recently I think) to $63...it was $50 three years ago, and only $55 until sometime in the last 3-4 months!</div>

Not a mistake -- it is the 70 Cl. bottle<br />in each case. Other brands are selling but thankfully full shelves of those. Diageo have certainly<br />did a lot for this brand <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>
