				<div class="content">Hi<br />First time on the board and I'd be very grateful if someone could help me with a query regarding a Coleraine whiskey.<br /><br />I have in my possession a bottle of Coleraine Irish whiskey. The label says '70% proof, 26 2/3 fluid ounces bottled by Coleraine distillery limited'. <br /><br />As far as I know this was purchased in 1975 at the old Coleraine distillery before it closed in 1978. The level in the bottle is down to 'shoulder level', but the seal remains intact.<br /><br />Could any one give me any more information on the bottle together with a approximate value as I have somebody interetsed in buying it.<br /><br />Thanks very much<br /><br />Norman</div>

				<div class="content">Last stuff out of Coleraine was in 1964 just before the Charrington takeover.<br />Highly unlikely it is a Coleraine product as that bottling only contains whiskey no <br />older than 6 years old ( blend of malt &amp; grain ). This blend was launched just<br />to keep the old name alive. Bottling for both Bushmills &amp; Coleraine used to be<br />done in Coleraine --- not sure if this is still the case !</div>

				<div class="content">The most it would have from Coleraine is grain whisky as production was ended in 1978 as you note.  Since this bottle states its contents in imperial it must be pre-1980.  All ties in with 1975.  I suppose the clever response is it is worth what someone will pay for it.  That said I think a price more than 150 quid is fantasy, say 125-150?  Don't take that as gospel, more an educated guess.</div>
