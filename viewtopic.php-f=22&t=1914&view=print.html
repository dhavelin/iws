				<div class="content">Hi, <br />I'm wondering if anyone can help me, working on a production of an Irish play in London, it's set in a rural Irish bar in 1997. We are trying to source period bottles and labels, for props and set dressing. I was wondering if you could be of any help in specifying what labels would have been in circulation at that time, and whether anyone has any images we could use as reference, in particular Jamesons and Paddys, although anything form 1997 would be of tremendous use.<br /><br />Many Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Woolley, and welcome to the forum<br /><br />my first advice is to get this book for Â£6 ;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Irish-Whiskey-Almanac-James-Murray/dp/1897784333/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364990505&amp;sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Irish-Whiskey-A ... 505&amp;sr=8-1</a><!-- m --><br /><br />this was published in 1994, and had the range of whiskeys was in circulation, so this is possibly the closest reference guide<br /><br />than look for the bottles and signs you see in it, on ebay, or whiskyauction, or amazon<br /><br />may someone can offer something here for sale, but most users collect rather than sell<br /><br />best of luck to the project <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />let us know how you get on</div>

				<div class="content">Jameson bottle was largely unchanged since 1997 until today (although a subtly new bottle shape was released last June)<br /><br />The image below is Paddy of the same era, only distinction is the signature on the emblazoned red stripe is 'Paddy' as opposed to 'Paddy Flaherty' today<br /><br />Hats off to anyone who could spot the period differences, sometimes whiskey labels don't change that much...<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">It is unfair to expect me to remember the '90s.  I was drunk at the time.  I think Powers is more or less the same and you can still find Bushmills and Jameson 1780 bottles from that period without much difficulty.</div>

				<div class="content">All really helpful. We've ordered the Irish Whisky Almanac, and the image of Paddys is really useful. Thanks!</div>
