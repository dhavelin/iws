				<div class="content">Dungourney is 500 euro from the distillery,<br />Think the Bushmills can be bought for about 120 - 140 euro,<br />Not sure about the other one.</div>

				<div class="content">I've seen the 1973 on sale from €1600 in Belguim  to €4000 in the airport.<br />Shops like <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/">www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/</a><!-- w --> and <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/">http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/</a><!-- m --> have some interesting prices.<br />I really feel that the Dungourney 1964 will be a great investment.<br />Hopefully you bought your bottles before 2008 when Irish Distillers raised their prices.<br />I read an article earlier on the forum regarding pension investments <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://examiner.ie/business/investors-u">http://examiner.ie/business/investors-u</a><!-- m --> ... 69780.html<br />it says Scotch but with Irish Distillers and some of the members in this society  pushing our stuff i don't see why it wouldn't be a great investment.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not 100% sure, but sure enough to post this. That I seen the 1973 in the airport 2 weeks ago for 1,600 euro and 1,300 duty free. I must stress that I'm not 100% but I remember considering buying an expensive Midleton (and I already have the 25 year old and the 26 year old) but the other half dragged me away.</div>

				<div class="content">I just checked TWE and their selling Dungourney 1964 for £1200 and CWS is selling on it for €699. Seems €500 in the distillery is cheap,i believe they don't have a huge amount left too.</div>

				<div class="content">Still available in T2 for €500. Take retail prices from specialist whiskey shops with a pinch of salt. IT's demand that will dictate that and there is not a whole pile for Dungourney just yet.<br /><br />Possibly need to wait a few more years.</div>
