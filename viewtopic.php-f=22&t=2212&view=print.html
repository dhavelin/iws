				<div class="content">Hi folks,<br /><br />Although not a Connoisseur, I was lucky enough to be invited to the very first Kilbeggan &quot;Connoisseur Experience&quot; last week in which a very small group of us received a  personal and exclusive behind the scenes tour of Kilbeggan Distillery by Cooley Global Ambassador for Beam, John Cashman.<br /><br />It was just terrific fun!<br /><br />As well as the personal tour, we had some exclusive tastings from the Cooley stable, sampled worts and newly distilled produce, had an audience with the Master Distiller of their small Kilbeggan distillery and even bottled our own personal naggin from the cask.<br /><br />All followed by a late lunch with John and more exclusive tastings from his own personal collection.<br /><br />They are going to run roughly one a month for the summer. Further details over in the Events guide on my own site at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://irishwhiskey.com/events/connoisseur-irish-whiskey-experience-kilbeggan/">http://irishwhiskey.com/events/connoiss ... kilbeggan/</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but bring a driver!<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Stuart</div>

				<div class="content">Very surprised that this distillery activity wasn't communicated via official channels within the Society, considering the relationship that exists. Shame really that the website isn't used to better effect. Or perhaps Suntory are going in a different direction with their promotion?<br /><br />Do you have a particular connection with the distillery/industry Stuart?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi John,<br /><br />The event I attended last week was just a trial run that I was in the &quot;right place right time&quot; for, so this forum and my own website are the first to hear of the dates for the real events which were only announced last Friday.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Stuart</div>
