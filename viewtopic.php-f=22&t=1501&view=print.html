				<div class="content">Let's see if I got this correct? 1780 a Jameson Irish whiskey (or more corrrect I guess a whiskey from Bow Street Destillery) could have had a maltbill containing only malted barley- The singlepotstill.com (nice page by the way) pointed by some reason out the year 1792 as somewhat startingpoint for the use of unmalted barley but I have understud it as a slow process rather then a specific turning poin. Anyway, Jameson then turns over to pure pot still and it then was keept as such until mid-60:s when it was change into a blended affair with some portion of grainwhiskey to meet customers demande for lighter taste.Does it also today contains some portoin of single malt whiskey and when was that included in the recepie?<br />The whiskey is destilled in Midleton, Cork but matured, blended and bottled in Dublin?<br />Thankfull for help with corrections if needed.<br /><br />/Uffe</div>

				<div class="content">One more question. Did J. Jameson started the destillery at Bow Street or did he buy a running one? If the later, what is the history before 1780?</div>
