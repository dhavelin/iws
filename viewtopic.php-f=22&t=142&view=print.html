				<div class="content">Any ideas on what's worth buying?<br /><br />I think the current Highland Park 21 bottled at 47.5% abv. This is a great whiskey and the newer version is going to be bottled at 40% abv. It's available in Duty Free.<br /><br />Also, the Laphroaig 15. It's a lovely whiskey and is being replaced by the 18. It's very gentle for a Laphroaig, but still great, in my opinion.</div>

Parker's shop is close enough to the distillery, and once it changed hands, they were right down there to see what was going on. I think that's how they did the deal. Initially, they were only going to do one, but they tasted some excellent stuff and asked for two. They also have some sort of relationship with BenRiach. <br /><br />I am not sure how to judge the price of whisky anymore. It seems to be all over the place.</div>

				<div class="content">Who's for getting IDL to sign an affidavit on this one. I'm also tired of hearing them say that the last of these bottles have been sold. <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br />As a side bar, has anyone else noticed the 'duty free' and 'travel value' prices creeping up lately. They might be taking the duty off but they still seem to be losing their competitiveness with high street by increasing the base price? Seems to be the case in Dublin anyway, other airports seem to be much better value. Celtic tiger still clinging onto the DAA clif-face I wonder.......</div>

				<div class="content">This is part of the last batch<br /><br />The last batch was a pallet of 600 bottles, now it is totally impossible for us to store this amount, so i think we took half, the rest was supposedly reserved for us(i think), but they sold it to any tom dick or harry, we knew it was running low so i just asked how many was left this morning and i was told 18 bottles, so i ordered the lot<br /><br />This last batch was reserved for Germany but the couldnt sell their original allocation, so they put it on the market again hence its availabilty in Ireland.<br /><br />Now i may be wrong and IDL have 3 trillion bottles stashed under Barry Crockets mattress.</div>

When it was €80 a bottle we thought is was expensive and were delighted when we could import it for €50. Then it went to €120, so when I saw it a €80 in Midleton I went mad and bought a load of them.<br /><br />They still had a few on the shelves in Midleton last time I was there.
