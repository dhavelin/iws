It's finished too. There was a 16 year old single Cask I think. <br />Bushmills 16 is in short supply but I'm sure it not going.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Good Whiskey Hunting.<br /><br />Thanks for the reply on this topic as well as my single cask post.<br /><br />I did mean Powers 12. Sorry about that. <br /><br />Just wanted to confirm what I was being told really. I picked up a bottle of the Paddy Centenary and Powers Special Reserve on the weekend and have an order of Jameson 12 coming my way in the next few weeks. <br /><br />Learning lots and lots to learn.</div>
