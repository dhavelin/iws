				<div class="content">Have you found that your registration attempt has failed???<br /><br />We get a lot of spammers registering and luckily we have so far got them all before they got their grubby hands on our forum.<br /><br />However it may be a case that we have deleted a few authentic users by accident which may have looked suspicious to us. If this has happened to you we do apologise but please feel free to contact us by mail and we will sort out your registration for you.<br /><br />Thanks for your patience.</div>
