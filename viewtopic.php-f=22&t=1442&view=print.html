I was thinking just about current ones but certainly if you go back even just a little while you could add:<br /><br />Greenspot 12yo <br />Jameson 12yo Distillers edition<br />Jameson 12yo (Red Label)<br />And i think the first CWS single cask was a 12yo (blend).<br />And there was a german 12yo Midleton blend at some stage too.</div>

It was pretty nice.  I still have a few of them.</div>

				<div class="content">I only seen this now.<br />You mentioned the  Midleton Suddeutche Zeitung 12 year old.<br />I've been looking for this on for a while. Was it a nice one? Would you see Midleton launching a 12 year old for a cheaper price or do they feel they have the marked sewn up with the range you mentioned above?</div>
