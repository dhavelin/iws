				<div class="content">I have researched this myself and have found no references to any bottlings, it appears they stopped distilling in 1912 following a takeover by DCL.<br />It is likely that at this stage that their main output may have been grain/patent whiskey for export to the UK, the market for which was saturated at the time, hence the takeover by DCL who shut them down in 1925.<br />Distillery bottlings first started in 1890 afaik so there is a fairly narrow window for bottling. Also sales of whiskey by the cask were still a common form of trade.<br /><br />Let me know if you discover any information yourself.</div>

				<div class="content">I was down there today and no one knew I will try the library.Even as sale by cask would it not have been sold under a name or bottled some where else into a named bottle?<br />Some one local must have some old bottles or some passed down information.<br /><br />The museum is well worth a visit.</div>

				<div class="content">Casks at the time were most often bottled by the vendor/spirit merchant just as 'Fine Old Irish Whiskey' or some other generic title, particularly when blended with cheaper grain spirit. Only occasionally will you see whiskey bottled with reference to the distillery at that time and then usually to indicate a premium. Could you shed a little light into the purpose of your research, I'd be interested in your efforts to uncover the story.</div>
