				<div class="content">Hi there Dublin User,<br /><br />I've seen pictures of the White's JJS before, judging by the bottle  lip and driven cork, i'd say this was 1940s.<br /><br />The Powers is a little later I would say 1950s/1960s. John Egan &amp; Son Ireland Ltd were located in 18 St Stephens Green until at least 1963 (now Anglo HQ)<br />The bottle is very similar to the Paddy bottle from the same period.<br /><br />I'd have no idea on the HAIG Gold Label but you could try McTears or the WhiskyMag forum.<br /><br />What would be helpful is a picture of the base, or if you transcribe the details. Might be able to glean a bit more info.<br /><br />In term's of value it is hard to Judge but the Whites JJS 12 sadly has no foil seal which makes it worth very little, <br /><br />The Powers Three Swallow again has suffered detioration of the label, in mint condition could be worth as much as €300, i'd say €150 in present condition.<br /><br />Obviously with items like these value is quite subjective. Please post more details if you have them, how long in your possession, any history, details of markings on base of bottle, provenance etc all help in establishing the story.</div>

Could nearly go as far as late 60's early 70's ... these would have been the last Pot Still bottlings before going to the new main stay of the Powers Gold blend. Value possibly €150-250</div>

I tried in vain to get that hennessy and the Midleton 12 year old. I would have estimated they would be about €170 -€200,but somebody really wanted them and had deeper pockets.<br />The Midleton 26 year old made a fair price too.€1011.<br />I remember buying one for €590 in  Germany a few years back and though i'd over paid.</div>
