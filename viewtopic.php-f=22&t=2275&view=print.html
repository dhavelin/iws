				<div class="content">here here, Luke. Unfortunately, now it means something closer to non-age statement Ardbeg, Non-age statement Macallan and whatever super-special-ultra-premium sweet but flat young malt in a sweeter flatter wine cask the industry can hock off onto its customers for dishonest money. Plus VAT.</div>

				<div class="content">Too true. They've seen the hole in the market, but is there a market in the hole? <br /><br />This thread is gone way off topic. I hope anyone from the Mayo distillery doesn't take offence with our rant about premiums. None is directed towards you. We all hope you do well and succeed. It's great for the industry and for rural Mayo in general.</div>

				<div class="content">Totally agree with you Willie. Best of luck to the lads in Mayo and, if nothing else, i'm glad to see more peating coming back into irish whiskey. Personally, what i'd love to see would be a peated Single Pot Still, as that's something unique that none in Islay or Midleton is ever going to produce.</div>

				<div class="content">What does not convince me is the price! In an interview the<br />Founder is on record as saying that the entry level for a standard<br />Bottle is €80! At that price not too much of it will be sold in the<br />Bars of Mayo. The mini cask of spirit is definitely a great idea and<br />A real novelty for those with patience and no great thirst.</div>
