				<div class="content">Hi guys. I found this site  while searching google and wondering if anyone here could help me with a query? Im lucky enough to be going to Kentucky with work and Im just wondering about bringing some bourbon home in my suitcase. I know the duty allowance is 1ltr but is it possible to bring home more than that and declare in it Dublin airport and pay duty on it? I wouldn't mind doing that if its  possible but I would hate if my purchases were confiscated as I plan on buying some nice bottles!  I know the other option would be to sail through customs and not declare. Ive never been stopped previously!<br /><br />Ive been adding bourbon to my Irish collection for about two years but as you probably know bourbon aint cheap here. Looking forward to contributing more to the forum and will upload some pics of my collection though its only small compared to some on here!<br /><br />Any advice would be weolcome. Cheers guys<br /><br />Ed</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not 100% sure any more but your duty free allowance is different from bringing stuff home from point of origin country that you are traveling from.<br /><br />So really you need to know the value of your items against the value of items your allowed to bring home for personal use.<br /><br />You can bring crate loads of stuff home from fellow EU countries as long as you can prove it is for personal use. No so sure about the states though.<br /><br />I'm sure there is something on the revenue site about it. Check for duties payable on &quot;luxury&quot; goods.</div>

According to Revenue:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The goods in question may have been bought either duty-free/tax-free or duty-paid/tax-paid outside the EU.</span><br /><br />It doesn't give any information for bringing home more than 1lt.

I was kind of working on the assumption that the vat would be charged on the price I paid in the US so this is a bit of a kick in the teeth. Its hard to know what to do now to be honest. I plan on bringing 5 X 750ml bottles  so I will only be a bit over the limit. Ive read stories(not in Ireland) of people declaring small amounts and being waved through because they cant be bothered with the paperwork so maybe I could get lucky that way. It would be a shame to go to Kentucky and not bring anything home <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>

Also I'm guessing that the ones you will be bringing back will be hard to find ones over here so if they are asking about them you can say they are similar to Gentleman Jack or the like <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">I declare them. The duty isn't too bad for what your hoping to get. It would cost lost more in an European specialist shop like The Whisky Exchange. If you don't declare and are caught you'll find yourself being called aside for random searches regularly. <br /><br />The last thing you want to hear is a glove flicking and someone saying they'll have to go in dry. That's definitely the worst case scenario.</div>
