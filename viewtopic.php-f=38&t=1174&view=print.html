				<div class="content">AS ALWAYS I HOPE I AM NOT OUT OF LINE POSTING THIS MATERIAL.<br />   It's been pouring rain for the last few days. The book i just purchesed  ((&quot;DESIGNING AND BUILDING OF AUTOMATIC STILLS BY  RIKU&quot;))) is a let down so i dug out the microscope and hooked it to the computer. I want to see if i can get some actual photo of yeast budding. I was planning to dEstill the poteen wash but its so wet on the deck, i might get electrocuted.<br />Besides the rain i still have about 35 pounds of barley to  mash and ferment into a wash.<br />   Since yeast has always played a  major part in the  making of  whiskey, i have been studying as  much as i can about it and how it produces diferent flavors under diferent conditions.<br />Naturally since there are about 1500 variteys of yeast only a true brewmaster could choose which one to use.<br />Tkese 2 pictures are of lalvin ec1118 which i use for  making vodka because it can handle 18 percent wash and makes very little flavors.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/YEAST%20PHOTOS/rectangularyeast-1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The rectangular shape confused me but i believe  it is this way becuse of clumping duringdehydration<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/YEAST%20PHOTOS/yeast2budding.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />i believe that this is a single yeast cell that is in the process of budding.</div>
