				<div class="content">Having some 'Old Canada' which really is old. The bottle dates to the Seventies, and the whiskey inside is likely seven years old or so.<br />The brand has long since been discontinued (the Acadian distillery shut in the mid 1980s) but you can still find the odd bottle in Germany.<br />It's pretty good stuff - toffee, bourbon notes, apply finish, but a strange cognac quality to it too. Not particularly balanced but quite unique. I like.</div>

				<div class="content">I've not been sippin regularly over the past month and felt like I've been virtually absent from the auld cratur ... okay it has not been torture or anything but I felt I've been ignoring it .... bold boy I hear you say.<br /><br />Anyway tonight I had a RedBreast 15yo which is as always superb ... sorry but I just don't tire of this whiskey.<br /><br />Next up I had a 1970's Powers ... and it really stands up to the RB 15 ... yes I'm really enjoying this older version of an Irish institution.<br /><br />But now I'm on a dram of Blackbush from the 60's and  I must say it is cracking. I had opened this about 6 weeks ago and though it was lovely but gothing nothing imparicuar from it. However tonight I'm getting a lovely rich smell from the sherry but it is not the modern day christmas cake style it is more fruit and rgape rather than dried mixed fruit i.e. raisin etc.<br /><br />Taste is even more revealing ... there is a lovely richnesss to it with ... mouth filling rich and heavy mixed fruit flavours with allspice and liquroice ... uuummm lovely  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>

				<div class="content">Connemara cask strength tonight, with a wee drop of water.<br />Opens it up into pear and woodsmoke notes. Very pleasant altogether. I do think this is as far down the peaty road as I'm comfortable with. Some of the Islay peat monsters seem a bit antiseptic and one note to me sometimes.<br />But Connemara doesn't overdo the smoke, and throws in some welcome fruit and sweetness too.<br />Very pleasant dram.</div>

				<div class="content">Now on a 14 yo single cask, cask strength Glenfarclas. It's bourbon finished, so not the strong sherry influence you get off the distillery bottling.<br />It's sort of like tasting it naked. It's a little herby, mint and green tea, but with butterscotch wood influence and a bit of peat too.<br />It's a Cadenheads bottling. Very nice too, and a good strength at 59 proof.</div>

The Lagavulin Distillers Edition, distilled 1980 and bottled 1999 was a clear favourite of more than a few attendees.  Unctious is the most appropriate term to use.  A glorioius bronze colour - very syrupy (benylyn comes to mind), lots of sherry and peat.  A faint whiff of damp.  If tasted blind, I'd say it was a Bowmore.  Revisiting it now as I write.  Wonderful stuff!<br />/M</div>

				<div class="content">Bushmills Sherry Cask at Cask Strength 53.7%.<br /><br />This is still the best Bushmills I've ever had even after tasting 2 different but wonderful Millennium 1975 Bush's (Thanks Ken  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />  ) . There is something about this in Cask strength form that I adore. Strong and Powerful but not over powering and the sherry is not dominant either. It's a 15 or 16yo from 1989 and I rue that it is not available anymore especially at the €70 mark which I paid for it in 2005.<br /><br />I would love if Bushmills released a similar batch of these Cask strength botttlings <br /><br />Just one large one left in the bottle which I will savour over the week-end</div>
