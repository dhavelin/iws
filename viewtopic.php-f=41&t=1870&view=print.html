				<div class="content">Hi Badger,<br />Sadly the resale price on bottles of Marconi Jameson have not reached the great heights I, at least, expected. I got one last month on whiskyauctions.com for â‚¬85 or close about. It was cheaper than the Jameson Gold that sold in the same auction. I really though it was a nice interesting whiskey, sadly I lost nearly a full bottle recently. I have replenished my stock for the time being. <br />I would assume your has the box and is in good condition. I would hold on to it or even open it for a special occasion. <br />I only wish you'd posted this last month, it could have saved me some postage.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you Good Whiskey Hunting <br /><br />Unfortunately I don't have the box, it was amongst a few end of line bottles in a basket by the check out. Looks like I will have a good drink soon. Thank you for your reply, much appreciated.<br /><br />Regards</div>
