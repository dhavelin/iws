				<div class="content">I'm not really sure if this is the right place in the forum to put this, but I can't see anywhere else suitable.<br /><br />I've just been out and had a Bowmore 18 yo, a Connemara Cask Strength, a Suntory Yamazaki 12 yo and an Auchentoshan 10 yo (barmans choice). I then came home and watched a movie, and decided not to spend the rest of the night drinking expensive whiski(e)s. So I took out the bottle of Powers 12 yo. I've never really tasted the difference between a really classy whiskey and a fairly ordinary one, and I'm not saying Powers 12 is that ordinary, but Jesus, the diffierence was stunning.<br /><br />I'd love to know does anyone actually agree with me, or am I just being a snob!!<br /><br />P.S. As most people should know by now, I'm not one for nose, palette, etc. so, I adored the Connemara, loved the Bowmore and Auchentoshan was fabulous. Hope thats enough!!</div>

				<div class="content">Aberlour A'Bunadh.<br />Finally cracked it open tonight.<br />I can't say it stands up to the heights of last night, when I was lucky enough to try a 16 yo Bowmore Port finish thanks to Michael Slevin.<br />But by God, it's a great wee dram altogether. Non-chill filtered, cask strength just under 60 and kicks like a (sherried) mule at that.<br />Drop in some water and it opens up nicely with plenty of caramel and toffee notes giving way to some faint smoke, cognac top notes, milk chocolate and a little rubberiness.<br />I understand each batch has its own slightly unique qualities. This one is batch 21.<br />30 euro in C de Gaulle airport last month! What a bargain.<br />I'm a little concerned about the colour, though. It's got a very dark colour, even watered, that makes me suspect the presence of caramel additives. Bit poor form for something that bills itself as an artisanal product, if that is the case.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>I don't think there's caramel added, Jim. Maybe they use a lot of first-fill sherry casks.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I think your right there ... In Germany they have strict laws and if a colouring has been added to a whisk(e)y it has to be listed separately as an ingredient. There fore out German brothers can at a glance know if there is caramel (colouring) added just by looking at the bottle.  I will try and get a confirmation to this but have a feeling this was discussed before on other forum.<br /><br /><br />Just on a side note for some of the newbies .... in relation to Caramel as it can be confusing when used in relation to the colour and the flavour.<br /><br />Caramel colour and Caramel flavouring in a whiskey can be two separate and independent discriptors. <br /><br />A whiskey can be coloured with Caramel and yet you may not get a caramel taste from it.<br /><br />However Caramel and toffee as taste descriptions can be quite common in various different whiskey (with or without the presence of the colour)<br /><br />Further the amount of colouring used in whiskies is tiny and said to be in the 00.0*%<br /><br />Most bog standard whiskeys would have this colour added to ensure the uniform colour of the product. Whether this is right or wrong is down to the individual person to decide.</div>

				<div class="content">Last of the Abunadh - really cannot recommend this little cask strength sherry bomb highly enough at the price. Plenty of toffee goodness, good blast of spice and all underwritten with the tiniest hint of peat and the heat of 59.2 abv.<br />Finished off a Knappogue 95 too - brilliant summer dram, light, grassy and with that warm Bushmills sweetness.<br />I've recently opened up the Irishman 70, that odd mix of Midleton single malt and pps, and find that the pps character is very noticeable. <br />But if the strange tang coming off this blend is actually Midleton single malt and not any grain character, then I have to say I'd be a wee bit concerned about the single malt down in Cork. Does this stuff go into anything else, do people know? I presume some goes into some of the IDL blends.<br />Mostly, summer drinking has been young Antrim poitin, into which berries have been macerated Polish style for months, topped up with ice and tonic.

				<div class="content">It is. I got my knuckles rapped by the Irishman people about this actually, because some gremlin in production inserted a couple of errors into the paper's story on their recent Irish Coffee world record venture.<br />The story suggested that the Irishman used Bushmills single malt in their blend. I don't know how that crept into the article, but it did, and the Irishman boys were quick to clarify the matter with me.<br />So I can confidently state that they use all Midleton whiskeys for the Irishman 70.</div>

				<div class="content">I have to say I like their single malt quite a bit, but perhaps that's predictable. I don't think the 70 hangs together quite as well - the pps character is great but it seems to war with the malt base a little bit? Certainly an interesting dram. Nothing else of its kind is out there. Haven't tried the cask strength. It looked a little pricey to me, but I've heard only good things from those who have tried it.</div>
