				<div class="content">I sure would like to find a book that is only about the actual process of making Irish whiskey.<br /><br /> I am learning that the first problem that i am facing is  emulating the water.<br /><br /> I have found a basic process which calls for distilled water and then adding  burton water salts or doind the following treatment<br /><br />1--BRING 6.6 GALLONS OF WATER TO A BOIL IN A POT. (This is for the standard 5 gallon batch )<br />2--ADD 2 HEAPING TEASPOONS 12grams OF CALCIUM SULPHATE AND 1/2 TSP OF SODIUM CHLORIDE<br />3-- BOIL VIGOROUSLY FOR 15 MINUTES TO 1/2 HOUR<br />4--SWITCH OFF HEAT AND WAIT FOR PRECIPITATION TO SETTLE OUT.<br />5-- THEN ADD Â½ tsp/2 grams OF MAGNESIUM SULPHATE <span style="font-weight: bold">AFTER RACKING THE WATER OFF THE PRECIPITATION</span><br /> Im not sure of this but its all i could  find after reading many books.<br /><br />Maybe i should  just  move to the ARAN ISLANDS  where the revenuers cant find me  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br /><br />At any rate im still very much in the dark about emulating the water.<br /> The water is basicaly what  helps make the whiskeys from everywhere  unique.<br /><br /><br /><br />still trying to learn <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Are you quite sure about the water making a difference Scotty?  A lot of distillers would say that half the flavour comes from the 'new make' and the other hald comes from the maturation in wooden barrels.<br /><br />Mineral water would be the same as water here I'm sure.  Remember as well that almost all whiskey is watered down to 40% by the addition of regular water from the public water supply, although they must do something to remove the chlorine and flourine (which is included by law in most of the water in Ireland and the U.K.).</div>

Also the aging on  charred oak. Yes the  diluting is a consideration that i never thought of.<br /><br />Just a note on aging. A few folks on a couple of whiskey websites tell how whiskey  just about everywhere is aged  and stored in warehouses that are very warm in summer and often freeze in winter.<br /> A few of the fellas have tried <br />1--finding a suitable container<br />2--Abbing charred oak chips<br />3-- placing it in the freezer a day or 2<br />4-- Taking it out to let it complety return to room temperature<br />5--Repeat this cycle  a few times<br /><br />This possibly emulates a full year of aging.<br />testing  said it seemed to work.<br /><br /><br />If i ever get to that stage, i will have to ship a few pints to members of this group for evaluation.<br /> Well at any reate, the  more input i get the grater the possibility that i may be able to produce a spirit that is acceptable at the least.<br /><br /> I see i would have to treat a sufficient amount of water for dilution as well.</div>
