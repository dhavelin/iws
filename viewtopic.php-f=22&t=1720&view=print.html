				<div class="content">Tonight we had a whiskey tasting with the local whiskey club. The theme was Irish whiskey and we started buy giving a short description of the difference in production between grain, malt, single pot still and blended whiskies. Then we tried<br /><br />Jameson Irish Whiskey (5)<br />Greenore 6y (3)<br />Clontarf Single Malt (1)<br />Red Breast 15y (2)<br />Tyrconnell Single Malt (4)<br /><br />We gave scores 1-5 and I have put the totalt place in () behind.<br /><br />It was close between Redbreast and Clontarf as both got equal first place vote. People did agree much in putting Jameson in the bottom with mostly fiftplaces and just a few forthplace votes.<br /><br />During presentastion of the result we talked a lot of each brand and the rounded up thhe evening with shrimpsandwich and a beer.</div>
