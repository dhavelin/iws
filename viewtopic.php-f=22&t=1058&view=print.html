				<div class="content">That was well spotted David! Fair play. Why is it in German though - is this not for sale in Ireland also, so surely that would just raise more questions than not?<br /><br />On the other issue. Given that other distilleries insist that they do not use caramel - is there perhaps a different colouring agent that could be used? If so, the defence that they don't use caramel in the maturation process would be legitimate. Just a thought.</div>

				<div class="content">I certainly had to dig deep in the forum to find this discussion and even then there aren't too many thoughts on this whiskey.<br /><br />I just want to say that I tried this in the Maniacs' Awards 2011 and was very impressed, although it was sampled totally blind at that point.<br />Yesterday evening one of the other Manaics joined me for an evening of whisk(e)y &amp; discussion and we revisited this whiskey. Still excellent.<br />It does have a style that I personally like.<br /><br />Malty</div>

				<div class="content">I did write it up on my own blog. Like yourself, I really liked it, which was a bit unexpected since I didn't take to the 15yo. There is a secret ingredient in the 18yo though: some sherry-finished malt. Perhaps that's what gives it the balance it needed.</div>

They usually mention which ones are in the various products, E102 E621 etc. Tullamore Due also has it too. Although it's not on the bottle to my knowledge.<br />Is the 18 year old bottled or labeled in Germany?</div>
