				<div class="content">which ones should I order ?  <br /><br />   Hi all,<br /><br />      I have been checking out the Celtic Whiskey Shop of Dublin, Ireland (on line).  It would appear there are many Irish Whiskey NOT available in the U.S.  I have attempted to use the Celtic Whiskey Shop &quot;search&quot; function but, dear God, is it ever PAINFULLY sloooow to load (if ever).  It is so slow in fact, that I can't take it and just &quot;click out&quot; of the site all together.  I am pretty sure my computer is not at fault as I recently had my computer updated/overhauled.  At any rate, I am open to suggestions for (unavailable in the U.S.) Irish Whiskey.  <br />Anyway, from the information I could find on Celtic's web site, the following Whiskey has peaked my interest : <br /><br />REDBREAST &quot;15&quot;, WRITERS TEARS, GREEN SPOT, LOCKS 8.  Are these some of the better choices ?  <br />I am open to any and all suggestions. Your help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br /><br />    Thanks for all the recommendations.  Most of what you guys listed is NOT available <br />(at least to the best of my knowledge) here in the U.S.  I am keeping a running list and plan to do a bit more research of these Irish Whiskey.  I appreciate all your help.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />   The following Irish Whiskey is all that I've be able to find (here in upper New England/Maine &amp; NH).<br />Bushmills Original, Black Bush, and Bushmills 10, 16 &amp; 21.  Jameson, Jameson 12, Jameson 18<br />Powers, Powers 12, Paddy, Tullamore Dew, Tullamore Dew 12, Michael Collins (blend &amp; SM),<br />&quot;The Irishman Original Clan&quot;, REDBREAST 12, Connemara CS, Midleton Very Rare, and the entry range  of<br />Kilbeggan, Tyrconnell, Kellan, Clontarf, Knoappogue Castle.  I think that about covers it all.  NH does NOT carry Paddy nor Powers 12.  I have a feeling Ireland is still hanging onto most of the best stuff!<br />So far, my favorites are REDBREAST, BLACK BUSH, JAMESON 12 &amp; &quot;THE IRISHMAN ORIGINAL CLAN&quot;.<br />REDBREAST being the most expensive at $43.00 (NH price).  $38.00 on sale!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">When you say from Ireland do you mean order it from an Irish supplier or order Irish whiskey on line. There may be differences in price depending on how you do it - though if you're not charged duty it should be not too bad either way.<br /><br />And from the purely patriotic economic standpoint it's an export either way which is good for our balance of payments!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi IB,<br /><br />   Yes, (sometime in the future) I'd like to place an &quot;on line order&quot; from (for insance) &quot;The Celtic Whiskey Shop&quot; of Dublin, Ireland.  I did a Google search for Imported Irish Whiskey and &quot;The Celtic Whiskey Shop&quot; looks to be a good bet.  Heck, I couldn't find a single U.S. &quot;on line&quot; business that sells (hard to find) Irish Whiskey.  I would of thought there would be at least a few SPECIAL &quot;on line&quot; sellers of rarer Irish Whiskey in the U.S. but, so far, no go.  Mind you, I'm not talking about $$$$$ rare years Irish Whiskey.  I'm talking about the likes of GREEN SPOT, WRITERS TEARS, REDBREAST 15, LOCKES GRAND CREW etc.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi SixCats<br /><br />All those are only really available in Ireland or Europe. Unfortunately the distillery don't distribute Redbreast 15, Green Spot etc in the US, and the Locke's Grand Crew is a limited release only available in Ireland. <br /><br />There are shops, like Park Ave Liquors and <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.binnys.com">www.binnys.com</a><!-- w -->, that will have some single cask Irish whiskeys that aren't available in Ireland, however. They should have the Powers and Powers 12 too. <br /><br />Regards<br /><br />John</div>

				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br /><br />    Thanks for the very useful information.  I will be checking out Binnys for sure.  Ooh yes, I too read about<br />REDBREAST 15 coming to the States by (perhaps) the end of this year.  I just hope it's not TOO expensive, however, I suspect it's going to be near (or above) the $100.00 price range.  I may just have to stick with the 12 in that case (which is not a bad thing!).<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>

				<div class="content">SixCats!<br /><br />You're getting some great recommendations here. And really, it's hard to go wrong. You might want to ring the CWS with specific queries and additional recommendations. I've ordered from there in person and by phone before -- doing my own bit for the balance of payments. I also have nearly all of the whiskeys mentioned in this thread. I'm about 30 miles north of Boston myself and am actively organizing the IWS American chapter. Drop me a line via email using my user name here (at) mac (dot) com. Sorry to be so obtuse about the address but I'm trying to camouflage it from the webcrawlers.<br /><br />Sláinte,<br /><br />Rich</div>
