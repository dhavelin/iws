				<div class="content">i was recently given a 70cl bottle of this as a gift.  i have to say, i am extremely disappointed.  i poured myself a glass last night with a few drops of water.  it smells of formaldehyde and the taste made me dry heave.  i am not exaggerating at all.  it was the first time i had a whiskey i could not drink.  i had to dump it down the drain and im thinking of dumping the entire bottle down the drain as i will not be touching this stuff again.  i actually felt nauseous all night after drinking it.  i just got done emailing kilbeggan to let them know.  maybe it was a bad batch????  has anyone else ever had this stuff?  im interested to see what other people have to say.  maybe kilbeggan will feel bad and toss me over a 15yo bottle as a gift, LOL.  one can only hope.  i just opened the bottle again to smell it and honestly, reminds me of when i had to dissect a frog and crayfish in school.   BLAAAAAAAAAAA</div>
