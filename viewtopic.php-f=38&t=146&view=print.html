				<div class="content">Just to let ye all know Ireland has caused another upset in the Twenty20 world Cup First the Netherlands beat England no Ireland beat Bangladesh. They are now through to the Super 8's which is the main part of the competition and a big deal.<br /><br />They comfortably beat Bangladesh with 6 Wickets to spare which basically is a thrashing. It was a big shock in the cricket world but Ireland seem to have a good game in the short game.<br /><br />Probably not peoples thing but it still is Ireland and it's nice to support them ...<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />Please no gaffs about foreign sports  bla de bla as you know you've all supported Ireland either in the Soccer or Rugby even if it was only a little bit  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>
