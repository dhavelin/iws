				<div class="content">I know An Post (Irish national postal agency) has banned all liquids from being posted internationally through their system not alone alcohol which was always in force but we used to be able to get around it <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />.  However They have really got strict in the last few months. I reckon Ally has an arrangement with his courier. The likes of DHL, UPS and FedEx have their own cargo planes so may be able to get around commercial restrictions that others can't. Just hazarding a guess though. Makes life very awkward though and it will cut down on a lot of private transactions unfortunately.</div>

				<div class="content">Seems that Royal Mail and the CAA have listed alcohol above 24% on their dangerous substances list. Now all shipping will have to be via courier freight services which will result in a sharp increase in shipping costs. Also an increased likelihood that customs will slap their bad karma on the precious goods.</div>

				<div class="content">I was just putting together a TWE order for shipping to the USA and saw that there is now a customs charge of 20 pounds, which brings delivery, etc. to 45% of the value of the 3 bottles I was ordering.  I assume this is related to the new rules?  I just couldn't do it.  I think I now need to redefine &quot;must have&quot;.</div>

				<div class="content">I had an order sent a a week or two ago from TWE.  The shipping cost was up, but no customs charge.  This is a worrying development.  I wonder if it depends on the state?</div>
