				<div class="content">An Irish Single Malt for Sainsbury - distilled at Cooley Distillery.<br /><br />N: Oranges, bitter oranges, more orange. Big malt barley. Oh and a healthy whiff of sweet sticky orange fruit cake, with background spices and dried fruits playing a part. Not much else but it doesn't need it.<br /><br />T: Exactly as above.<br /><br />F: A bit on the short side, but more or less faultless. <br /><br />They've gone easy on the E150, and the sulphur ( which i'm overly sensitive too ) is incredibly light to me, no problems here. But guys, those of you that haven't tried it should, it's no complex whiskey, very simple in fact, but i can see why JM rates it so highly. Price as a consideration makes this an excellent buy.<br /> <br />edit: the 'fruitcake' dimension has developed with more complexity.</div>
