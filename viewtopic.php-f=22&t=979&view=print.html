				<div class="content">Reading the &quot;Maly Whisky Yearbook 2011&quot; , I came across the assertion that in respect of Bushmills: &quot;Two kinds of malt are used, one unpeated and one slightly peated&quot;.  <br />The website <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.whiskyguild.com/irish_whiskey_distilleries.htm">http://www.whiskyguild.com/irish_whiske ... leries.htm</a><!-- m --> makes the same claim and an unanswered question was raised on whiskeymag <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.whiskymag.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=429">http://www.whiskymag.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=429</a><!-- m --> in 2001 referring to Michael Jackson's 1987 world guide to whisky.<br /><br />The Bushmills website <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bushmills.com">www.bushmills.com</a><!-- w --> says they use &quot;un-peated malted barley&quot;.<br /><br />... So which is true?</div>

				<div class="content">I have often got a smokey something off Bushmills in the back ground however I'm not sure it is peat.<br /><br />Bushmills themselves say they don't use peated malt.<br /><br />The taste I get sometimes, and it is only sometimes, would be more like a coal type smoke taste.<br /><br />It is usually only from the cask strength versions and as I usually only drink the sherry casks maybe it has something more to do with the shwerry casks than anything else.<br /><br />Possibly a slight sulphuring and we are talking minimal as I have never got the taste of sulphur. <br /><br />Interesting question though and would be nice to get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />I see it as a positive anyway as I like this minor taste affect.</div>

				<div class="content">This has been in the MW Yearbook for some years. I asked Colm Egan (Master Distiler at Bush) about this last time I was up there and he said they haven't done any for many years (they might have done a bit for Hewitts way back, not sure).</div>
