				<div class="content">Personally I'll reserve judgement till I see what price they're going to be. I notice they're now to be regularly available - if this results in a drop in price then maybe more people will get to enjoy an older Talisker. I say this as a big fan of the 25yo editions up to now, of which I've bought and drank a few.<br /><br />Now if the price doesn't come down that would be a different matter. Still though, I'd like to taste them before coming to any firm conclusions.</div>

They are great whiskies. At least the 2006 is.</div>
