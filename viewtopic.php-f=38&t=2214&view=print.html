				<div class="content">3 whiskey talks at the Ballymaloe literary Festival over this <br />weekend (17th./18th. May). Attended one of them which was <br />very enjoyable as it was given by renown Whiskey expert David <br />Broom and well known mixoligist Nick Strangeways. Dealt with <br />the making of Irish Whiskey from the 1500's and the use of <br />different combinations of botanical s etc. to give a flavoured <br />whiskey. Quite a few interesting items to sample.</div>

				<div class="content">Any experiments we might try at home?<br /><br />I was all ready to book a day at the drinks theatre there but there was nowhere nearby to stay and no public transport so I don't know how they expected people to get to it.</div>

				<div class="content">Good setting. Full house for that talk. Nearest accommodation of a realistic price either @ Garryvoe Hotel c.5kms.<br />or Ballycotton Hotel c.7kms. Taxi would have to be used from Midleton. No bus passes the door. PowerPoint at the <br />talk was too small and couldn'tbe read by anyone ! One interesting simple recipe is 'NOYAU' where newly unfurling <br />beech leaves are put in a bottle with some white sugar and covered with a light whiskey ( Nick Strangeways suggested <br />Paddy or Jameson)  and left to macerate in the bottle for some weeks in a dark place.If you google'NOYAU' you will find <br />plenty of recipes most of which use Gin. Quite potent and very unusual taste. You might be slightly too late this year <br />even though I saw some of my own plants still unfurling a few days ago. In chemical terms you are looking at a 'Bison <br />Grass' effect i.e. coumarin which has Zubrowka banned in the U.S. A lot of the old woodland flavourings are being <br />rediscovered by consulting old cookery books from the Great Houses where some of them had liquor recipes peculiar <br />to that area/house usually contained at the back. Caution recommended with all such experimentation <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>
