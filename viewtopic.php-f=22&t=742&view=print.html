The worst thing about it was I was there the day they installed it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  Pure fluke on my behalf just happned tp be passing and they had it running but not sure if they were going to use the run-off. I took a few pics so I'll check the files for a date and should pretty much narrow it down to a month at leat if not the actual date.<br /><br /><br />Edit: Just checked and I reckon Friday 22nd of May  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  So you were spot on John.</div>

				<div class="content">Cheers guys, I was trying to tie it in with the first Kilbeggan micro (ex Tullamore) still which restarted distilling 19 March 2008, but as far as i know it wasn't until April that they started full distillation on site, therefore if it was around Friday 22nd of May 2009 the second still was fired up, I expect it was June 2009 they started getting their first production spirit. Therefore we can expect Cooley's first triple distilled offering summer 2012 at the earliest.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />If anyone can add/contradict the info above would love to hear further details.</div>
