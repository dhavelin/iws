				<div class="content">My good wife is treating me to €400 worth of a pressie and I have decided to spend it in the Celtic Whiskey shop. <br />I'm not completely fluent in whiskey but I do buy a few bottles a year and enjoy a dram most nights.<br />Presently I am drinking Power's John's Lane and  it is perfect. I like pot stills and am partial to a smok(e)y scotch from time to time.<br />So far my list would include a Madeira Tyrconnell, maybe a Laphroaig but would love to try a Japanese or an American whiskey (apart from the obvious ones).<br />Would love a bit of advise lads here and maybe on a Scotch or Irish that might be worth a look.<br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Shane</div>

I tried it at Whisky Live. As is the Celtic Cask single pot still, though that would make a bigger dent in your fund at €350.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome to the 40 club, I recently joined too, but didn't get such a generous gift. <br /><br />I tried the Yoichi single malt on holidays earlier this year and loved it. I got the 15 soon after and have not regretted. <br /><br />An interesting American? I think they have Jefferson reserve which is tasty. <br /> <br />You could alway try a new Writers Tears Cask strength.  The new Irishman is good too.  <br /><br />I finished a bottle of Scapa recently and liked that. You could also get the Redbreast 21.</div>

				<div class="content">My suggestions would be to go for a lot of more reasonably priced bottles rather than 2 or 3 expensive bottles. I also would pick my Irish from CWS AND the others from the whisky exchange.<br /><br />However if only buying local these from CWS.<br /><br />American<br /><br />Eagle Rare 10yo €50<br /><br />Japanese (not a great selection)<br /><br />Nikka from the Barrel €40<br /><br />Scotch<br /><br />Aberlour A'bunadh (cask strength heavily sherried) €65<br />or<br />Lagavulin 16yo €77<br />or<br />Laphraoig QC €60<br />or<br />Spring bank 15yo €70<br /><br />Irish<br /><br />And 4 out of these 5 <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Bushmills 1608 Anniversary €70<br />Lockers 8yo (lightly peated) €40<br />Tyrconnell Maderia €75<br />Writers tears €41<br />Yellow Spot €70<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />However if you shopped with the whiskey exchange you could get<br /><br />Laphroaig QC £37.15 (€44.75)<br />Eagle Rare 10yo £33.65 (€40.50)<br />And<br />An interesting<br />Karuizawa, spirt of asana single malt for £55.45 (€66.80)<br /><br />Plus £17 (€20.50)  postage would equate to just under €175 for those 3.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd agree with Irish Whiskey Chaser and would recommend getting several smaller bottles.<br /><br />In particular, you could use it as an opportunity to try some different styles. So maybe a <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/GlenDronach_21_Year_Old_Parliament-z-product-product-1163-context-brand-page-1.htm" class="postlink">glendronach parliament</a> or the <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/-brand-73-z-brand.htm" class="postlink">mortlach 16</a> for a big sherry monster, <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/-brand-464-z-brand.htm" class="postlink">kilchoman</a> for a young peaty whiskey from a new distillery, get the tyrconnell maderia finish if it's on your list or (if they still have it and you have the sponds) the teeling company silver release which is a like the tyrconnell maderia finish only more so!<br /><br />I'd also recommend seeing what they have by way of independent bottlings at the back of CWS. These change from month to month, but usually they have a few good independent bottlings. These are usually slightly more expensive than the standard bottles from most distilleries, but they are often cask strength (or at least 46%), non chill filtered, usually a single cask and invariably more interesting than the standard bottlings.</div>
