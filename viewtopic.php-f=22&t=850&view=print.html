				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Potted History of the Museum/Visitor Center</span></span><br /><br />In 1982 Powerscreen International Ltd purchased the premises in Kilbeggan and handed over the main part of Kilbeggan Distillery to the Board of Trustees of the Kilbeggan Development Association. The local community rally around to help preserve the history and contribute memorabilia, by July 1985 a preservation scheme is started with the help of 10 workers through an employment scheme and the Distillery Museum is opened. In May 1987 Shop and cafe opened on the premises of the Old Kilbeggan Distillery. In 1991 with the assistance of Cooley? the Museum Commitee take out a 99 year lease on the distillery.<br /><br />The local community have worked hand in hand with Cooley to preserve and develop the distillery, and now it appears the time has come for the next stage of the development of the facility. This will entail Cooley taking over financial responsibility for the entire site, possibly by end year. We can speculate that Cooley will sensitively develop Kilbeggan distillery further to take it to the next stage. This seems appropriate considering that full distilling, washbacks etc are now almost in place at the old site.<br /><br />A natural progression and secures the future and important for the local community considering that over 50,000 people visit annually.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/news/aroundthecounty/articles/2010/08/18/3999395-committee-to-ask-cooley-to-take-over-kilbeggan-museum/">http://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/news/ar ... an-museum/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/news/aroundthecounty/articles/2010/08/25/3999499-december-date-likely-for-decision-on-kilbeggan-museum/">http://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/news/ar ... an-museum/</a><!-- m --></div>
