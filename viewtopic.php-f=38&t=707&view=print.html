It's alright for you guys - you have hair - the Zombies take one look at my skull and they think they're looking at a big boiled egg!<br /><br />But rest assured I've been preparing for this for a long time.

				<div class="content">It's not all good news though Iain. Mad cow Zombies are known to be very nervous milkers and there is always a temptation for a proportion of the 'non-Mad cow Zombie' population to barricade themselves in until they are sure that the Mad cow Zombies have become placid. Sadly, by so doing, they run out of milk and are forced to approach the Mad cow Zombies for some lactose refreshment. Without the proper training and without sufficiently warm hands, this could end very badly and may cause a large scale reversion to the more direct 'Shotgun/Chainsaw' population management tool. <br /><br />Please contact the Mad Cow Zombie Milking in Safety Society (MCZMiSS) for more information.</div>
