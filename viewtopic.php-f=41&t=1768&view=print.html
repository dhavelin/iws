				<div class="content">+/- 200 GBP retail.  A shop like the Celtic Whiskey shop or the Whisky Exchange would buy them, but for quite a bit less than that.  Ebay is worth a shot, could get a much better price.</div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately in the open market about 120Euro seems to be the going value. A shame really as it should really be more but with so many of them around there is not a whole pile of interest in them and most collectors would have one in their collection at this stage.<br /><br />There was 365 casks released in total in 1999 for the millennium and sold privately so a lot of this is still in private hands and hits the market regularly. If you take 240 as the average yield (as I've seen casks with more) that is circa 90,000 bottles. So you still have a lot of people with stocks of this.<br /><br />By the way what is the abv if it is anything other than 43% you might be in luck. There was a younger version released at cask strength but there is also evidence that some of the 25yo's may have been bottled at cask strength too. If that is the case these are extremely rare and possibly worth a premium.</div>
