				<div class="content">I certainly apologise if I caused any offence. That's not what this board or the society is about at all, and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.<br />I was just trying to direct discussions to thread topics I felt were more relevant. I won't backseat mod again. Many apologies.</div>

				<div class="content">Group HUG!  (Just kidding).  I'm just glad all is well with everyone.  Hey all, I am soooo excited!   Zoltan was kind enough to ordered me a XXX-L &quot;IWS&quot; Tee shirt!  Man, I can't believe there is even a XXX-L Tee shirt to fit my fat <br />(6'3&quot; 265 lbs.) old body!  I plan to wear the Shirt somewhere special this Summer.  Me thinks I'll wear it to the North Atlantic BLUES Fest this July in beautiful Rockport, Maine!  I'll wear it PROUDLY!<br /><br />Regards,<br />SixCats!</div>
