				<div class="content">New purchase but haven't tried it yet, Drumcastle Irish Whiskey from Jewel-Osco in Chicago. It's very cheap, just $17.99 and appears to be the Osco house brand. A few years ago they sold an apparent house brand Irish called Origine. It was OK but disappeared before I could get one for posterity.  I think Origine was a Cooley and Drumcastle may be too although Teeling is in this business now too. There is thus far almost no information available.</div>

				<div class="content">OK not an exiting purchase but one I've never seen before and something for the collection, a 1 liter bottle of Barton's found at a liquor store in South Carolina. Fun fact, in SC USA, you can't buy liquor in the same place you buy your beer and wine. So in one liquor store I had to pay for my beer, exit and go into the liquor part. It was divided by a plexiglass wall so you could see the other side but not get there! Also picked up The Dubliner and some John Sullivan 10 year, neither readily available in Chicago.</div>

Really it's a good way to fluff up the collection as 100% of the people I know couldn't tell a Barton's from a Barry Crockett. Sad but true. Also, one obsessive reason I try to get one of everything is Erin Go Bragh 6 year old. Bought 3 bottles at $25 and drank one. I got sick and thought I could never drink again. Gave 2 away only to see CWS selling it for $600 a few years later! Got the green light to drink again and now I want one of everything just in case, even though that will probably never happen again.</div>

				<div class="content">Powers 12. I loved the John Lane Signature, &amp; with a bit of hinting, got a bottle of Powers 12 for my birthday.<br />Cant say im impressed by it. Its pretty much standard powers, but a little more refined.<br /><br />It certainly has more depth, and a lot more vanilla, but i dont think its a massive improvemnt over regular powers. <br />The grain whiskey comes through much too strongly for me giving it a taste of a cheaper whiskey.<br /><br />Where i found the John lane sig full and strong like powers should be, it has a lot of subtlety, where the 12 doesnt.<br />I wouldnt buy another bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">Not the best whiskey and probably inaccessible for almost everyone on this board but Famous Liquors in Lombard, IL has Paddy's for $7.99 for a 750ml. Ridiculous for an Irish whiskey and they claim it's because of the road construction. I think there might be a little more to it. More to follow.l</div>

				<div class="content">Went to Springfield, IL USA for a work meeting. I always stop into liquor stores to see if there is something unique. So I went to a couple places and while there was nothing rare and exciting, I did pick up a few things that I thought were long gone;<br /><br />Millars Special Reserve<br />Millars 8 year old<br />Merrys <br />Origine <br /><br />Nothing outstanding but it makes the collection look a little cooler with some whiskies that most have never heard of.</div>

It has a little more sweetness &amp; sherry if thats what you're into ( which i very much am!)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Caol Illa 12</span><br />Just a 200ml bottle of this so i could do a side by side tasting when i got home. Its almost between Laga 16 &amp; ardbeg 10. rounder than ardbeg but sharper than the Laga. Great maltiness to it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Bruichladdich Island Barley</span><br />Wasnt sure about this at first at all but now its a firm fav. wish i bought a few bottles of this as cant get it in ireland yet. Very floral, initially reminded me of Greenspot Leoville, lots of lemon, grass and light fruit, but very malty on top of that.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">-Writers tears read head</span><br />Unopened yet, anything that has a lot of sherry is my thing so looking forward to it.</div>
