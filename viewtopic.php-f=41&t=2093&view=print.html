				<div class="content">I was contacted by a family that inherited a collection of whiskeys grown over many years by an employee at Midleton. They don't have pics of all the bottles but I have uploaded some here:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/45040027@N03/sets/72157639323805136/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/45040027@N ... 323805136/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There's a Jameson 15yo, a Midleton Reserve, a Hewitts, an old Crested Ten... Anyway, if you spot anything of uncertain provenance for sale around here or elsewhere, I have the owner's contact details.</div>

				<div class="content">Don't forget to tell all the local pubs to be on the look out. The paddys and powers wouldn't necessarily be big collectable whiskies but are often bought by pubs to stick behind the counter.<br /><br />Also, one would have to assume that the type of person who burgles houses is not necessarily an expert in whiskey, so is probably most likely to try to offload it to pubs or off licences near to you.</div>
