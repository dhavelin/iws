				<div class="content">It occurred to me that Done Deal , <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.donedeal.ie">http://www.donedeal.ie</a><!-- m -->, might be explored to determine its potential for enabling the disposal and acquisition, aka selling and buying, of collectible  whiskey among enthusiasts.  It is a facility that could avoid some of the delays and hassle associated with whiskey auctions.  And, of course,this IWS Forum is not a trading site.<br />A thought is fruitless without action, and so to this end I have have launched the boat with the listing of a naggin bottle of <span style="font-style: italic">Green Spot</span>,old-style label, screw top. <br />I shall report on response and, meanwhile, invite others to participate to help establish a whiskey stream in the Collectibles section of Done Deal.<br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ken,<br />They may remove the ad, it breaches their terms and conditions, sale of alcohol. <br /><br />I have contacted various people who have posted whiskey for sale and notice the ads are removed. When I ring again to see of the bottle is gone they tell me he ad was removed by Donedeal. I seen your ad yesterday and hopefully all goes well.  If you post 'whiskey for sale', it's usually removed quick enough. <br /><br />You can't sell on eBay here or the UK either. Adverts.ie are strict too. <br /><br />The forum is a good spot for people who want to sell, as long as they are not openly discussing price and personal details. I managed to get a couple of gems over the years. <br /><br />Best wishes with the Green Spot.</div>

				<div class="content">Many thanks GWH for your info and insights.<br />I'm still listed. <br />This can mean that DoneDeal sensibly recognises that such a bottle and its contents is truly a collectible artefact and that no-one would buy it to consume the contents.   It is a  <span style="font-style: italic">objet culturel </span>and along with bottles of similar status worthy to traded in their Collectibles section.<br />On the other hand, perhaps they haven't noticed yet!<br />I am a glass (not Green Spot old label, of course)half-full person and I am going with the first theory. <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I see someone is selling a 1973 25 year old Midleton and a 1969 30 year old Midleton for â‚¬5500. The seller didn't even spell Midleton correctly. <br />The Celtic Whiskey Shop looks like its good value now.</div>
