				<div class="content">Hi Matt,<br /><br />Is this an Irish or Scotch or is it a Cooley bottled by West Cork <br />because they are only at it themselves 3 to 4 years at the very <br />most ! I think they have used Breton whiskey in the past as well.<br />What precise phraseology is used to describe the product ???</div>

				<div class="content">2 of them (one a 10 year old) have just gone up on the Whiskyauction website<br />where you can have a good luck at the labels. Labels look good and the contents<br />description appear in order but the question is not answered of where the 10 tear<br />old is from. Label design is attractive. I like the inclusion of the map.<br />If there is anyone from the West Cork Distillery monitoring the forum it would<br />be great for them to engage !!!</div>

				<div class="content">Not sure about the West Cork stuff.  Does the label say 10 year old Irish Single Malt?  I have heard rumours... but can't say anything for sure.<br /><br />Now &quot;Jack Choice&quot; I can comment on.  That would be the preferred tipple of the eldest Teeling Brother.  It is a very nice single malt with some older elements adding to the flavour profile. The whiskey has spent some time in a Sauternes cask which has added an extra length to the finish.  I think it is great value and a good malt.</div>
