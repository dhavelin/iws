				<div class="content">Hello to everyone. I'm new to this forum and I'm looking for some of your whiskey knowledge as mine is very near zero!<br /><br />My father has a bottle of 1964 Talisker scotch whiskey from the Isle of Skye. It was given to him by a friend about 15 years ago. Its unopened and all the labels on it are perfect. <br /><br />My sister is getting married soon so the plan was to drink it on the day of her wedding. But if its worth a few pound it'd be better to sell it off and help pay for the wedding, as we not exactly a family of whiskey connoisseurs.<br /><br />We are wondering how much this is worth as its now 48 years old, as we have completely no idea.<br />Thanks<br />Ross</div>

				<div class="content">Talisker isnt the most collectable of Scotch whiskies, probably because there is not a lot out there to collect (its very drinkable!). Your bottle is an independent bottling by Gordon &amp; McPhail (independents can fetch less that distillery bottlings at auctions). Does it say on the label what year it was bottled as that would give an idea of the age, im guessing late 70's/early 80's(This was a typical Gordon &amp; Macphail label of that era) making at most a 20 year old whisky (whisky doesnt age in the bottle so it isnt 48 years old) On a poor  day you may on get €100 for it but if the right collector is in the room you could achieve up to €250-€300 or more. You could contact Gordon &amp; Macphail directly(they have a shop in Scotland, its bound to be on the internet as well) for  more accurate pricing.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />One sold for STG £252 in June 2010 (equivalent to c. €312 today)<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/17988/lot/233/">http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/17988/lot/233/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />That would be a high profile auction, so a private sale may not achieve as much,<br /><br />So I think Michaels estimate is best  at €250-€300.<br /><br />Bottles like this would be in demand for 50th Anniversaries in 2014, so holding onto it until 2013 might earn you another €50.<br /><br />Best of luck...</div>

				<div class="content">I sold one, albeit a little bit older, for about 700 euro a few years ago. I will try to dig out the details. <br /><br />Actually, the 1960s ones are rarer than the 1950s ones, as far as I can see. The most recent 1950s ones can sell for over 1,000, although I saw one go recently for between 700 and 800. You have to have a few people after it for it to get top price, of course. You take your chances at auction. You could ask the Whisky Exchange if they'd be interested in buying it from you.</div>

				<div class="content">Talisker, yum yum. Below £400 is a low estimate. Talisker dont have many bottles by independents with Talisker on the bottle. I think £500 to £600 for the 60's editions is a fair price and McTEars and Bonhams are risky. You can find a Talisker collector like me <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> but my pockets are empty now.</div>
