				<div class="content">You have missed one out. <br /><br />There is a <span style="font-style: italic">Jim Murray's Whiskey Bible 2006</span>.<br /><br />For those of you looking to complete sets, improve your air gun shooting skills or just genuinely ruin your eyesight, I believe signed/unsigned copies are available for sale from whiskybible.com.<br /><br />There is a very good reason why some years there are &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">Whiskey</span>&quot; versions and others there are not. If you spot me in some part of Ireland/Budapest and ply me with a peg or two of a long-lost Irish brand, preferably Pure Pot Still from a vanished distillery, or a finger or two of <span style="font-style: italic">Old Ferencvaros</span>, I might just consider telling you....</div>

I wonder what you thought of it. <br /><br />Any plans for a book other than the Whisky Bible series, a la Classic Irish Whiskey or the Irish Whiskey Almanac?</div>
