				<div class="content">Do anyone have some information about Marlfield Olde Irish Liqueur Whiskey? It's distilled and bottled at Daly's in Tullamore in 1946. It has then been matured in the Suir Valley. I got to taste it at The Lanesborough Hotel in London a week ago and I wonder what stuff it is that I tasted? It was 20% ABV, very thin, over oaked, not pleasant at all <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> But fun to have tried. I would now like some info about Daly's and Marlfields. I found about a Daly's in Cork but this was in Tullamore.</div>

				<div class="content">The Suir valley connection is reference to Robert A. Merry &amp; Co. of Cashel Road, Clonmel, Co. Tipperary who acquired<br />a cask of the whiskey from daly's of Tullamore. I acquired one direct from Merry's in August 1998. They gave it the<br />'Marlfield' name in honour of an old Distillery that stood outside Clonmel ( long gone ). Apparently the story i was given<br />was that water leaked into the barrel etc.and they bottled what was left. Had to sell it privately as by law it should not<br />be called whiskey as it is only 20%abv. Mine is still intact so just wondering how was the taste test  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /></div>

				<div class="content">Just tried this, it is like Willie Napier, absolutely drowned.  The are tiny flashes of distillery character, but the sum total is completely washed out and un-scorable.</div>
