				<div class="content">OK I've got the hump again over the Cooley Glen Mor thing so, to lighten my mood, I thought I'd try and start a list of other silly things the SWA could do.<br /><br />(1) Take an injunction against the entire Waterford village of Ardmore on the basis that they're trying to pass themselves off as a speyside distillery.<br />(2) Force my favourite pub in Louisburg, An Bun Abhainn, to change their name in case someone thinks they took a wrong turn at Westport and ended up on Islay  <br /><br />(3) John Jameson was from Scotland. By calling their biggest selling whiskey Jameson IDL could be considered to be attempting to pass it off as Scotch.<br /><br />(4) All young children called Johnny must henceforth be prevented from using those walking toys in case anyone refers to them Johnny's walker.<br /><br />(5) Likewise, no one should ever take a dog call Johnny for a walk.<br /><br />(6) Every valley and lake in Ireland must immediately be renamed removing the words Glen or Loch / Lough.<br /><br />Feel free to add to the list.</div>

Thank you for a very cool link!  My knowledge on the history of whisk(e)y is something I hope to improve upon in the coming years as I am a fan of 'history' in general, but am definitely lacking in knowledge on the spirits front.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Apparently when Cooley started out they were going to call one of their brands Glen Mor or some varient thereon which is the name of the valley behind the distillery. The SWA kicked up a fuss and they decided it was easler to drop the idea than fight it, being a small independent at the time. At least that's what we were told at the distillery.<br /><br />That said, I have since come across a Scotch blend called Glen Mhor so maybe it's fair enough.</div>
