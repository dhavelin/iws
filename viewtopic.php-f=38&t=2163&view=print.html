				<div class="content">Hello all and Happy St. Patrick's Day!<br /><br />I've been curious, while having a couple of Smithwick's and Kilkenny's over the past couple of days, here in Ontario we really only have the Diageo group of Irish beers (Harp, Kilkenny, Smithwick, Guinness...yes I know that it is all waaaay better on tap in Ireland than what comes out of taps over here) available to us (that I know of).  What are some other Irish breweries to be on the lookout for?  Is there much of a craft beer industry in Ireland (as there is in the US, and as is in development in Canada)?<br /><br />Any and all feedback and info is greatly appreciated!  Will likely fill my evening with a Kilkenny, and pours from my bottles of Writers Tears and/or Redbreast 12...been loving them both!</div>

				<div class="content">Happy St. Patricks day. <br /><br />Sadly Guinness/Diageo and Heineken dominate the market. Diageo have closed a few breweries like Phoenix in Waterford. Heineken may do the same to Beamish in time. <br />There has been a few craft breweries in the last few years. I think O'Haras is available in some places but not sure. I know there's one called Killians for George Letts &amp; co. but I can assure you it's not made by them in Enniscorthy nor is Wexford Cream ale made here. <br /><br />The future is looking good for the craft beer industry all the same.</div>

				<div class="content">Craft beer is becoming quite a thing in Ireland now with dozens of micro-breweries. I doubt much gets outside the country but Coors bought Franciscan Well not so long ago so perhaps that will get exported. O'Hara's is a big enough operation to export. I tried their whiskey cask-matured barley wine today. I don't actually drink beer but I quite enjoyed it.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd really be interested in finding out a few craft breweries next time I'm in Dublin. There's a positive flood of them in England at the moment. And so many delicious offerings.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Johnny,<br />If you try the <a href="http://www.beoir.org/" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Beoir</span></a> webpage they have lots of info on Craft beers. The society are doing a <a href="http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/events/2014/2014-09-25" class="postlink">tasting</a> this month. <br /><br />We write more about distilleries here then breweries. I believe they go hand in hand as do most members and enthusiasts. I would recommend our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IrishWhiskeySociety" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration: underline">facebook</span></a> page too, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/IrishWhiskeySoc" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration: underline">twitter</span></a>. <br /><br />All links are underlined to save you searching. <br /><br />Sl√°inte,<br /><br />Willie</div>
