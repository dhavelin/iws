				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I saw an old bottling of Paddy and was wondering how much it is worth. The fill level seems ok even if not full. I saw bottles for sale for about 200 Eur. I think this is maybe from the 70's. Any thoughts?</div>

				<div class="content">I think you would be very lucky to get anywhere near 200 euro but you could get lucky. I would say between 40 and 80 euro. Might be worth more in a few years.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks. I will risk it, it's under 50 Euro.Seems very cheap but the bottle looks unopened.<blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>I think you would be very lucky to get anywhere near 200 euro but you could get lucky.

				<div class="content">That's probably early 80's I think. Worth â‚¬50 on a good day. Retailers can put a ridiculous price on them because there's always someone that's going to spend silly. <br /><br />The fill level isn't great. There's a lot of evaporation or leakage. I'd be cautious about buying to drink. I've got a few bottles over the years with bad fill levels and all but a few were tarnished.</div>

				<div class="content">Agree. I would put a max. Of 50 euro on<br />this. Nothing special. Now if you were <br />talking about a Paddy 7 or 10 yr. old then<br />a different story.</div>
