				<div class="content">The William Jameson is an easy one ... the Irish Free state was only in existence between 1922â€“1937 so a fairly narrow date time line to pin it down to. However this is an American bottle so rules out prohibition years 1920 to 1933 but the tax label tells us anyway. The free state label may have been used up until WWII and as there is a 1937 date on the tax label we can probably date it to 1937-1939<br /><br />I would not pay much attention to the England label though.<br /><br />The Powers is harder ...looks like a driven cork to me so maybe you can confirm that.<br /><br />It could be anything from early 1900's to late 1930's but pure speculation. It really is hard to date some of these bottles and the condition could easily make it look older than it is but the glass bottle itself looks like an early bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">Here is my pre 1920's bottle of Jameson which the WhiskyBro located for me in the states. If he has time he can give the authentication details.<br /><br />But basically the bottle type is similar to your Powers. Driven Cork and not quite perfect glass in the bottle.<br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Jameson/JohnJameson1920s.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi John,<br /><br />Not sure why they used ABV,I can't find any laws/regulations that state whether you could use proof or abv in the US,<br /><br />However I don know that 22 U.P. (under proof) was a very common strength at that time.<br /><br />For example Greenspot used to be bottled at 22 U.P. which as far as I know works out is 45% abv.</div>

He went to his back room and returned with the Prestons bottle. He GAVE it to me <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I realise its only 70's.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ashburtononline.co.nz/whiskey/whiskey12.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">The Jameson 5 Star is 45% abv (came from US), John was asking a question about it.<br /><br />Greenspot was bottled 22up along with a lot of other whiskies during the 1920s consistent with the c. 1918 Jameson at 45%abv.<br /><br />Sorry if i laboured the point.....</div>

				<div class="content">I was just curious about the US use of 'proof'. I wrote an article on my own site about it once. The US definition of proof has such a simple relationship with ABV that they are pretty much interchangeable for the consumer. I would have been surprised, then, if they had obscured things all over again by using &quot;under proof&quot;.<br /><br />[And it's an interesting side topic when and why Irish whiskey moved from 45% to 43% to 40%]</div>
