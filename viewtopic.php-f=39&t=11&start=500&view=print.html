				<div class="content">Hello friends, rivals, aficionados and others, <br /><br />I've been drinking whisky for a long time coming, as I do, from the Highlands of Scotland, where the drinking of malt is, for some of us, still a rite. I've lived in Ireland, though, for the last 18 years and during that time, I've slowly developed a love for Irish whiskey, and begun to question the superiority of Scotch, not least because multinationals have bought so many of the distilleries there, while in Ireland local ownership still prevails. <br /><br />I'm here in the hope that I'll be working as a whiskey tour guide over the summer, and therefore this is my attempt to broaden and deepen my knowledge. <br /><br />My motto? Vero nihil verius (so I don't stint on honesty) - but living in Ireland has me adding a coda - with compassion!<br /><br />Look forward to good discussions here.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello everyone.<br /><br />My real name is Derek, I'm 50 years of age but not for too long and I work as a supplier to the industry.<br />The company I work for specalise in high end glass spirits bottles and accessories with small production runs and low tooling costs.<br />So being open and transparent I am here to gain information on distilleries as these are where my existing and new customers come from.<br /><br />Having said that, seeing as I'm calling into lots of distilleries and hunting them down one-by-one it does mean that I can pass information back to you. I just need to be careful that this information is public domain as the confidentiality between customer and supplier is paramount.<br /><br />I do drink whiskey. occasionally. Mostly down to the fact that by wife drinks bourbon and not the good stuff either. Still €14 for a bottle of Jim Beam in Schiphol is hard to turn down. So feel free to ask me any packaging questions - I don't expect many - and I'll try and contribute as much as I can to help your knowledge on up and coming distilleries.<br /><br />Mal</div>

				<div class="content">Hello all,<br /><br />I've been a member of the IWS since late 2014 following an introduction at Whiskey Live Dublin that year, but only now am I getting around to joining in on this forum, something which I'm looking forward to!<br /><br />I always had a preference for whiskey from my first taste of Jameson, but in 2011 began expanding my range a small bit, starting out with Black Bush, Jameson 12, Jameson Gold, and onwards from there. From the first time I started to recognise the differences from one whiskey to another, and began to notice and appreciate the flavours, I knew this was something I had to become more involved in.<br /><br />I've built up a bit of a collection over the past two years; I'm sure compared to some of those around these boards it's modest but I'm happy with it and can't wait to keep adding!<br /><br />Great to be here and  hopefully I'll be having some good conversations with you all quite soon.<br /><br />Best regards, and sláinte,<br /><br />Kieran.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello to all!  I'd like to introduce myself; my name is Kevin Murphy (Irishman), and I'm in Truckee, California.  I was in Ireland about two years ago and had the pleasure of spending time with one of your locals, a fellow by the name of Garry Carroll.  Garry is one of a kind and a fine Gent - can't wait to spend time together again to sip and talk Irish.  I also had a wonderful experience to spend some private time with the Jameson folks, and to that end I'm eternally grateful.  The  meetings with their incredible management team was special.  <br /><br />Since 2014, we've launched our own Distillery here in Truckee.  (google 'Truckee, California')  We're small - 300gal Pot Still - and can produce about 6,000 cases/yr. at peak production.  We begin distilling and executing our chemical analysis of products this month.  Licensing in the good 'ol USA is a royal pain, but we finally got it done.  I look forward to following the threads in the forum, and want to offer anyone that comes out this way to private tours, etc.  Yes indeed, I will pay back the fine hospitality as best possible to all who visit.<br /><br />I wanted to toss out to my brethren that we're looking for a Distiller / Head Distiller / or anyone with experience that wants to come over to the USA for a year or so play with our system making a variety of whisky styles and spirits.  The expansion of craft Distilled spirits is exploding throughout, and finding help is difficult.    I think nothing would be finer than an Irishman on campus!  If there is anyone interested, please contact me at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:kevin@oldtrestle.com">kevin@oldtrestle.com</a><!-- e -->.<br /><br />WIsh I could make it to some of your private tastings and tours - but will some day soon!  Thanks for having me!<br /><br />Cheers!  Kevin</div>
