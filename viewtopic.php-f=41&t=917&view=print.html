				<div class="content">Hi Michelle, firstly welcome to the forum, secondly as this post is more about your bottle I have split it out to it's own thread.<br /><br />This should be worth a few quid all right but a picture woudl be help fulll be fore we can give you a valuation.<br /><br />I'm sure there will be a few people on here looking to make you an offer. <br /><br />There will be people that may say that this is worth 1000Euro but dont get too carried away about prices like that eventhough I could see a specialist whiskey retailer looking to charge that but it should be worth at least a couple if not a few hundred to a collector if the bottles looks genuine.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you can't post a picture here but have one I'll can post it up for you.<br /><br />Sounds like an exciting bottle but I'll reserve my judgement until I can see it. Would be nice to nkow why you think it is 1917 specifically.<br /><br />Many old bottles can be over estimated ...</div>

				<div class="content">Sounds really interesting, with all collectable bottles, label condition, authenticity, condition of the seal and cork are all critical in determining the value.<br /><br />Like every other sector collector values are also down.<br /><br />Best thing to do is <span style="font-weight: bold">post a picture</span> and or a link to something similar and we can try and advise you....<br /><br />The label on the traditional Powers bottle didn't change much for almost 100 years,<br /><br />By the late 1960s it still looked something like this...<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/PaddyPowers/PowersPPS1970s.jpg">http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285 ...

				<div class="content">There's a very old Powers bottle in the hotel on Foto Island. I wonder is it similar. I'd say it's very valuable, but it's hard to say what it's worth. Only guesswork, really.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi John,<br /><br />The 'Powers Very Old Irish Whiskey' in Fota is a 39yo bottled in 1960 (distilled 1921) for Lehman &amp; Co. New York, <br />I had the pleasure to stay there also and they said the bottles were donated by Midleton.<br /><br />Just the other week a spotted a similar one in Midleton itself on display on a high shelf (the eagle eyes hadn't spotted it before)</div>
