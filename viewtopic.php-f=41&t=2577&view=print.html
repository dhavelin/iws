				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />As most of you will know I have an interest in Midleton Very Rare Whiskey.<br /><br />I recently put a post up on this forum offering empty Midleton boxes (for free) for members of this forum as I have been able to get my hands on a good few through my work in the retail trade. I have already supplied a few to various forum members but I have also had a few requests for boxes/ certs/ invites that I do not have so if anyone has any boxes/ certs/ invites that they don't want any more can you please PM me? You may be able to help me help someone else on the forum who is trying to complete their collection...<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Ian</div>
