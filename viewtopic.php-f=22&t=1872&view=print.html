				<div class="content">Guys! <br /><br />If you like, please read my tastingnote of the new Teeling Whiskey blend. I received a &quot;sample&quot; bottle on monday the 11th of february from the Teeling Whiskey Co. <br /><br />Nose:<br />The first things that comes out of the bottle actually is quite &quot;rummy&quot; and raisiny with whiffs of pear. From the glass comes even more of the exotic, say peach, pear again, a soft vanilla, a bit of coconut with traces of grain whiskey, actually a bit like greenore in style but obviously more mature than the 8yo... the strength of the whiskey comes through as a bit of a heat on the nose (be careful when you put your nose in the glass) : ) after it has rested for a while it becomes really soft and sweetness and vanilla are most evident... also some milkchocolate<br /><br />Palate:<br />Tasting the whiskey I get loads of sweetness the first few seconds, honey, then moving on into mellow vanilla, the coconut is there, then comes a small dryness moving us into the ruminfluence, it's not hot in this phase but rather a little peppery that sits from the middle of the tounge and forward. If the nose has traces of grain the palate relies more on the malty components in the whiskey, nice aftertaste that boasts of fruity rum and dryness mixed together. Very more-ish. Overall this is a great Irish blended whiskey and, from where I'm standing, one of the few sucessful rumfinished whiskeys : )</div>

				<div class="content">Got a bottle of this tonight (in Limerick - good whiskey shop - can't remember name) - I'm quite impressed - I wasn't planning on getting a bottle but it was the only thing in the shop I hadn't tried. While I love cooley malt and grain whiskeys I've never been a big fan of the blends. This I like - had it alongside a black bush - compares very well. <br /><br />One question - what the &quot;since 1782&quot; all about? Is this along the lines of the Bushmills 1608 thing?</div>

				<div class="content">Well Tryconnell claims 1762 even though it had bugger-all to do with the original brand from Londonderry and that date can only refer to Watt, the Tryconnell brand is a 19th C Watt brand.  <br /><br />I'm leading a tasting for a local club on the 16th and one of the things I intend to cover is &quot;Bull S***&quot; in whisky: 1608, 1762, Bow St...  I intend to have some fun at the expense of some marketing departments...<br /><br />Maybe someone should open a distillery in Newry and lay claim to the date 1600 when a distiller burned the town down!  It`d annoy Bushmills!</div>

				<div class="content">The 1782 thing refers to the Teeling name. Jack is joining the dots between his forthcoming Dublin distillery, through his father's founding of Cooley, back to Walter Teeling who operated an 18th century distillery in Marrowbone Lane.<br /><br />I didn't want to write general comments on the tasting notes thread started by Distiller so I'll add 'em here. Luke suggested to me that Teeling would go well alongside a stout. He was right! I never drink stout but I had a Leann Folláin and Teeling in The Palace last Saturday and it was a great duet.<br /><br />I also ordered one on ice to see if the flavour stands up for casual pub consumption. It does.<br /><br />It's good to see it already available in various Dublin pubs. If it can hit around the €5 mark, I'll be very happy to drink it.</div>
