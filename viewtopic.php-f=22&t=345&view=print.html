				<div class="content">I have been given a bottle of John Jameson &amp; Sons Twenty Year Old Whiskey The &quot;Jubilee&quot; Whiskey with Woodford Bourne &amp; Co also mentioned on the label that is at least 30 years old.

				<div class="content">Potstill.de has an image of this label, but no further details. <br />Clearly a special one-off bottling for the Cork-based bottler. God only knows when, though. Betty the second's silver jubilee was 1977 and golden in 2002, but I doubt it would be commemorating either of those events.<br />I'm stumped, but clearly it's not recent, and is likely a 20 yo bottling from Bow Street, which would make it a) pretty valuable, and b) of interest to collectors with deep pockets.<br />I doubt there are many sealed bottles like this still floating about. Nice gift!</div>

				<div class="content">A Cork business/bar/hotel might be interested in this either - if any of them have any money left. The one on Fota Island has some fantastic whiskey displayed. <br /><br />I don't know if they buy things, but the Midleton Distillery might also be interested. <br /><br />Anyway, it's a beautiful bottle and a very interesting one too. An excellent prize.</div>

				<div class="content">This could be a seriously old bottle. Can get a picture of the capsule. i.e. top of the bottle.<br /><br />If it is what I think it is .... this is a 1000Euro plus bottle easily.<br /><br />I think there may be a few in Bow Street on display too. I have pictures some where just need to dig them out.<br /><br />My only issue is that this bottle looks too clean and new. <br /><br />I do not think that any of the Southern Distilleries would of released bottles for either of the current Queens Jubliee.<br /><br />However I do know they did release a bottle for a certain Jubliee and Bushmills also released a whiskey for the same event.<br /><br />Are ye ready for this ....<br /><br />It was QUeen Victoria's Diamond Jubliee.<br /><br />That was back in 1897  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />If this is one of those you have a 112 year old bottle.<br /><br />However caution needs to be taken becasue as I said this really look too clean to be true.<br /><br />Do you have any further information of where this came from. Can you go back and see who donated because this could be a seriously valuable bottle or it could be a hoax.<br /><br />This is possibly a seriously exciting find lucky you  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

The top is gold not shiny plastic with no writing on it. It was given to me by an aunt who got it as a present for doing a large favour in the late 1960's early 70's from a realtion who owned a bar in Ennis, it has been in a cupboard ever since. <br /><br />Neady</div>

				<div class="content">Yes I maybe getting over excited but for some reason I think Jubilee used on it's as a description for a celebration is tended to be used as an important anniversary for the Brittish Royals and therefore Jubilee on it's own was enough to describe the event. Also as we were part of the empire back then all Irish Distilleries would of seen the importance of this and some would of released  commemeration bottles. Bushmills just released a plain Jubilee whiskey too ... no mention of the queen. Maybe it was considered vulgar.<br /><br />Here is the bottle from Bow Street which I think is not intact so basically worthless.<br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Jameson/JamesonJubilee.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

Jubilee was in 1897 ... the whiskey casked that year could be released as Jubilee whiskey so making it no older than 1917. But as you say may have carried the name on for a while. However I don't like the Celofane on it. Not really a turn of the century wrapping method. Paper and hay I would of thought.<br /><br /><br />I think a mail should be dropped to IDL and I would reckon they will know for sure if they bother to reply<br /><br />neady can you see if there are any markings or letters on the base of the bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">If neady can track this down with IDL (Midleton) it would be very interesting to know when it dates from.<br /><br />I originally thought it was the QUeens Jubilee as Bushmills did a similar probuct and the bottle o display in Bow Street is quite old looking. However the bottle seems too clean to be 100+ years old.<br /><br />However let that not disheaten you. This is a rare whiskey and very unusual for it to be an exceptionally old whiskey.<br /><br />I still think it is quite a valuable bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm inclined to agree that the bottle looks a lot younger than a century, but I still suspect it is a pretty valuable find.<br />I'd like to proffer again the suggestion that it might have been bottled in 1966, with the golden jubilee of 1916 in mind. Remember that the entire year was spent, at Dev's instigation, holding celebrations nationwide to mark 50 years since the Rising.<br />So in an Irish context, that's the most plausible jubilee, other than JohnM's suggestion that it was the bottler's own jubilee, that I can think of.<br />Also, the bottle condition and fonts on the label would seem to indicate something a lot younger than the 19th century.<br />But like I say, a valuable bottle nonetheless, whatever its actual age and provenance.</div>
