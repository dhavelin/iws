It just says &quot;pot still whiskey&quot;.<br /><br />Where's JC these days - he usually get's annoyed about these things. The I don't have to be pickey.</div>

				<div class="content">Ah I understand. Still though, if you're going to sell someone potstill whiskey and allow them to call it that there's little point in trying to keep the distillery secret. For the next couple of years anyway. And even if you did buy malt from that distillery they may not have distilled it themselves. <br /><br />Anyway, who knows. If you can mix malt and potstill and call it potstill, and they come from the same distillery could that be called Single Pot Still. Maybe you could but it's confusing to say the least. That implies that if I throw some Erin go Bragh into Greenspot it's still SPS.</div>

Sorry for being so oblique but I presented Writers Tears at a society tasting and I promised not to blow the lid off the whole operation.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br />sorry I've been absent for a while but my wife has been ill and I've been enjoying stress for breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner.<br />Thankfully things are easing off now as she is much better and certainly back on her feet again.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, I'm working hard to get to my next milestone (whisk(e)y-wise) and have a backlog of notes which will be fed onto my website over the next 2 weeks and last night I had the absolute pleasure of revisiting Writer's Tears CS.<br /><br />I tried this as I mentioned at the recent Munich whisky fair and thoroughly enjoyed it but didn't write notes then as I was busy talking with Shane from the Hot Irishman stable. Anyway, I brought away the very last drops from his last open bottle and sampled it yesterday evening.<br /><br />I'll post my link to the tasting notes when they're online, but as a wee exclusive preview for IWS I'll say it was every bit as good as I remember with a lovely floral nose which also includes a surprising fruitiness (raspberry!) which fades to leave a wonderful generically fruity and malty butterscotch.<br /><br />The palate has an initial leafiness but soon expands to include honey and creamy toffee.<br /><br />4 Drops of water actually improve the nose even more as the floral elements are intensified, but the palate is weakened to the point where I say even though it's CS, don't bother with the water.<br /><br />As with many Irish whiskeys, this is always soft, gentle, smooth and incredibly subtle.<br /><br />Maybe you can detect from my wording that I am impressed, I love it and give it a very worthy 87 points.</div>
