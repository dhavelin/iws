				<div class="content">hey there.  just recently saw that the 18yo is on sale in PA state stores for $52.99.  this is an amazing price considering the 10yo is $44.99.  also, i know they discontinued the 15yo, but there are still some bottles floating around.  i located one near my house, but it is $57.99  is it worth it to have?  figure it is, just because they dont make it anymore.  how does it stack up against the 18yo?  just curious to hear what you guys have to say.  especially IWC, the lap nutter, haha<br /><br />cheers</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Brettie, at those prices you really can't go wrong, i'd lay down a bottle of each of the 15yo &amp; 18yo and report back here on your preferences <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi Brett,<br /><br />I really rate the 15yo even though many peat freaks don't. The reason possibly for this is that it is probably the tamest of the Laphs. The 15 is lovely and mellow and has smooth and easy to swallow  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  medicinal notes with lighter peat and smoke than the usual Laph attack. The 18yo is bigger which was initially surprising for the 3+ extra years in cask as it has a bigger kick than the 15yo. Eventhough the 48% over 43% of the 15yo can account for some of that it is still is a bigger whisky taste wise with more peat and smoke and I think it probably has more sherry cask in it also making it richer and more complex and of course the age adds to that too than anything younger. Diffinately go for the 18yo but if you can streatch to the 15yo get that too.<br /><br />I'd also be very interested in other peoples views on what they think of the 2 side by side.<br /><br />Have not had one side by side in a while but may break out a couple soon to refresh my memory.</div>

				<div class="content">in the middle of my first taste of the 18 and all i have to say is WOW.  much mellower on the peat side with soft silky hints of vanilla and honey.  this stuff is blowing my mind.  im trying to take my time with it so it can have time to breathe.  getting a lot more sweetness on the nose now.  call me crazy, but im getting some pineapple/mango on the nose now.  i must pick up the 15yo to compare....</div>

				<div class="content">Glad to hear some words about the 18 year! It is incredibly expensiver here in British Columbia - at $179.00, but I finally got my hands on a bottle. It is my most expensive bottle at the moment. Normally, I don't keep things for &quot;occasions&quot;, but in this case I think I will make an exception. It will probably be the last bottle of it that I get.<br />I wish that I had the chance to try the 15 year. I am sure that the Prince of Wales has a couple of bottle stashed away, as it is his favourite!<br />Am looking forward to trying it one day!<br />Cheers,<br />Carl</div>
