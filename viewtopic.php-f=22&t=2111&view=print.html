				<div class="content">Okay, we bring this old nugget of a topic up every so often and as it is the start of a new year I thought we might do it again as so much has happened in the last few years. So what are our whiskey aspirations for the coming year?<br /><br />What do you expect to see happening this year? What are your expectations from the distilleries and what would you like to see in regards to innovation?<br /><br />We have a strange set up currently ... Both Bushmills and Cooley seem to be with drawn from market in regards to new products and IDL and the Teeling Whiskey company are slinging out new products like good o.<br /><br />What would you be excited to see and what do you think is stale.<br /><br />I was very happy with a couple of the lower priced releases, Tullamore Phoenix and the Powers Signature Releases. However there were plenty other new releases too.<br /><br />So what do we want to see this year fingers crossed, or just a wish list.</div>

				<div class="content">Well we've had a new Spot, Paddy, Powers and Redbreast in the past couple of years. <br /><br />I really expect a Jameson SPS reserve to add to their range. It could be a 12 or 15. The only SPS we're missing from the usual ages is 18 year old. It would be great to see another similar to the classic 15. <br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if we got a 15 year old Spot. I think we expected a Red Spot last year but probably this year. <br /><br />Could we get a cask strength Redbreast 15 or a 12 B1/14.<br /><br />I do expect a very limited edition Midleton to commemorate the 30th anniversary. Remember the 20th. <br /><br />I assume there'll be a few single casks for the DAA, TWE, LMdW or CWS. <br /><br />As you said Beam/Suntory and Diageo aren't up to much innovation.</div>

				<div class="content">Rather than a variation on all the stuff that's been released already (Spots, Jamesons etc.) or something that doesn't exist yet (Bushmills SPS or the like) what I'd really like to see from existing stocks in Midleton - <br /><br />A single grain - maybe even a single cask single grain, from whatever type of cask. Maybe a virgin oak single cask grain - like the most recent CWS bottling without the potstill.<br /><br />A single cask SPS from something other than a bourbon cask - Madeira or Port would be amazing.</div>

Unfortunately I grew bored of those by 2010.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>Something similar to the Celtic Cask Sé... One of the nicest whiskeys I've had in a long time.

Very very nice so totally agree with you on that one.<br /><br />My main gripe is that there are no decent whiskeys from IDL in the 35 euro bracket and I really don't want to be paying 35 euro + for &quot;nice&quot; blends marketed as premium whiskey.<br /><br />Something like Writers Tears should not be costing more than 35euro in my opinion.<br /><br />As echoed some different cask matured/ finished whiskeys from any source. And even a totally new Brand from IDL as that could give them total cart blanch.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh yea and a pleated SPS, probably looking to go a bridge too far on that one but why not dream  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
