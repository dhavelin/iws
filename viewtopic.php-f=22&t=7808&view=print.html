				<div class="content">Travelled through Dublin airport (T1) this morning and was offered the Irishman 17yo (almost airport exclusive); Teeling Port cask for Dublin airport and the Bushmills Port cask - 2nd in the Steamship series. The Irishman and the Teeling are well worth getting. Personally I found the Bushmills Steamship port cask very weak and was genuinely disappointed. It is well presented however both on the palate and the finish were weak. Anyone else tried it?<br />J.</div>
