The rest tend to follow the Sheffield teams. I was a Sheff Utd fan way back. I still keep an eye on results but thats about it. These days i 'support' any good football, therefore i haven't watched an England game since Erikson took over ( i watched the world cup though <img src="images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> ). It seems to me that the idiots that run the game in this country do all they can to hamper the game for this country.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome Davin ... great to have you on board as JohnM says please educate us on Canadian Whisk(e)y.<br /><br />No big deal on the spelling as the Irish Distilleries in the old days used to spell it both ways, as you say people can get too caught up on semantics and not the actual whisk(e)y. My pet hate would be people who insist on nothing but single malt whisk(e)y but I suppose the Irish industry is comming fom a different angle.</div>

I am a relative newbie to whiskeys, and have so far stuck to Jameson and Paddy's.  While on my honeymoon in Ireland a few years ago I bought a bottle of Redbreast, and really enjoyed it.  I look forward to learning and tasting more in the future!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Pat</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Pat, welcome to the forum, sounds like you are ready for the Jameson 12, a big leap from the standard Jameson at a reasonable price (at least here in Ireland), be careful it is a slippery slope once you get to enjoy Irish. You must be pleased to see Paddy more easily available in the states.</div>
