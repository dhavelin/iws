				<div class="content">A night in Waterford city next week with my bro-in-law and would welcome suggestions as to characterful pubs with good beer and whiskey in the centre. Also accommodation close by, within (short) walking distance. Many thanks. Your health will be drunk!</div>

				<div class="content">Lots of student pubs there. But there are a few gems there. <br /><br />Geoff's is excellent. I think they do food during the day as well. <br />I remember eating in a nice pub the Gingrman near the Center too.  <br /><br />Always worth trying Henry Downes.</div>

				<div class="content">Only spotted this now ...<br /><br />There are 2 you need to go to anyway ...<br /><br />Downes on Thomas Street is a dark athmospheric pub but you need to visit just because of their Whiskey (They have their <a href="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Independent%20Bottlers/HenryDownsNo9.jpg" class="postlink">own bottle</a>)<br /><br />And Thomas Maher's or Moon Dearraigh (sic) need to check the second on the name but it is only a stones throw from Downes in closer to the Quay. Again they used to have their own bottling. On O'Connell Street parallel to the Quay.<br /><br /><br />Also a nice old style pub is The Gingerman and a nice bit of food too. Arundel lane off Cannon Street.</div>
