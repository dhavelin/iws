				<div class="content">No you are correct, there is no separate Midleton website at the moment. There used to be a website called Premium Whiskies of Ireland.<br /><br />With the launch of the two new single pot still whiskies I'm sure this will be supported by a new website at some stage.</div>

				<div class="content">I appreciate that Midleton have got the most important element right i.e. the product, but can't help thinking that Pernod Ricard either take the whiskey for granted or don't appreciate the role of Midleton as one of the flagships for Irish Whiskey.

As a result the focus on growth is much more on increasing revenue through new expressions such as cask strength, 30 year old, 25 year old etc. The flip side is that in the bigger world of whiskies, my experience is that Midleton is relatively unknown outside of Ireland and amongst many of my scotch drinking friends in the UK, most have never heard of Midleton. During the 4 years that I used to run whisk(e)y tastings in London I was continually surprised that the vast majority of people never heard of the whiskey.<br /><br />Maybe there is nothing wrong with all this but I think that this is a missed opportunity for Irish whiskey as we have a fantastic pot still product which remains very unique and in my view superior to many of the comparative premium scotch single malts on the Market today.</div>

If you look at the Green Spot bottlings before the repackaging there was always a JJ&amp;S on the front label - likewise the Midletons always have a Jameson crest. Yet on the new single cask Midletons which share the same label type as the Midleton Legacy (albeit with a different bottle shape) there's no mention of Jameson - likewise the new Green Spot only mentions Mitchells and Midleton.<br /><br />I would be surprised if we don't see a website / brand advertising for Midleton and / or Single Pot Still over the next while.<br /><br />In fact if they thought about it they could also probably market the Midleton VR as a &quot;Single Blend&quot; and even someday release a single grain.</div>
