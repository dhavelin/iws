				<div class="content">If I make a mash of malted and un malted barley, ferment it and then distill and mature I will have an Pot Still whiskey.<br /><br />What if I mash unmalted barley, ferment e.t.c. and do the same separately with malted barley. Mix the both new makes and then mature it. Will this also be called a Pot Still or will that be a blended?<br /><br />Does someone know why someone would do it like that instead of keeping them separated in the cask and then blend them later on?</div>

				<div class="content">If it were possible it would be a blend. However, it may be impossible to ferment a mash made purely of unmalted barley - malted barley provides enzymes which are necessary for the distillation process, as far as I know. Even when grain whiskey is made from corn, wheat etc. there is a portion of malted barley in the mix for this reason.</div>

				<div class="content">It's a good question, even if you have to mash 90%/10% unmalted/malted and blend it after maturation with 100% malted. I wonder how that would turn out, or if anyone has tried it in recent decades.</div>

				<div class="content">A lot would depend on how it was distilled - pot still or column still.<br /><br />A 90:10 split distilled in a column still would be a grain whiskey I guess, in which case blending it with Malt whiskey would be, more or less a normal malty blend - so it would very much depend on the malt : grain ratio.<br /><br />I've a feeling they normally use about 20% malted barley in a grain - but I could be very wrong.</div>

				<div class="content">Answer to first question is yes from a technical point of view as long as you use a pot still. No from a geographical point of view  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br /><br />The use of Malted Barley (in what ever ratio) with un-Malted barley or grain is recommended as it helps the fermentation due to the higher sugar levels in Malted barley. Yeast needs sugar to feed off to create the fermentation process. So a mash of Barley on it's own will not be as successful as a mash with at least some malt content but not impossible.</div>

Have really lost contact with my whiskey brain these past 2 years so if it's starch that maybe the reason but it is still malted barley that has the higher content and aids the fermentation process. As I said you can use just straight barley but it will benefit greatly for add malt.</div>

Isn't a malt blend a blend of malt whiskies from two or more distilleries.<br /><br /><br />Upthread there was discussion on needing malted barley for enzymes. This is true, i read somewhere that the mash must be at least 10% malted barley as these enzymes are needed to work their magic. e.g. when 100% rye whisky is made these enzymes are still added to the mash.</div>

I have spoken to Bernard Walsh about this a few times and I checked again after that presentation to be doubly sure. 70% malt whiskey, 30% pot still whiskey. I wrote up that tasting on my website:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.liquidirish.com/2012/06/irishman-and-writers-tears-whiskeys.html">http://www.liquidirish.com/2012/06/iris ... skeys.html</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">Hey<br /><br />You can have 70% malt and 30% barley in a pot still.  There is a minimum amount of malt required for pot still but not a max.  I think it is 30% but I can't find the papers.  I am also fairly sure that the requirement is also for a mixed mash and not a blend of whiskey made from different starch.  You are correct that a high level of unmalted barely is difficult to process.  Not impossible and in Ireland as you can use enzymes.  But I am fairly sure that there is a requirement for min of 30% malt in a mixed mash of barley.<br /><br />Hope that helps</div>
