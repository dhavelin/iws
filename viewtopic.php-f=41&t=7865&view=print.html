				<div class="content">That's a new selection. There's a cognac Forum online too. We're not affiliated but I've contributed one or twice. <br /><br />Has that Midleton a box? <br /><br />The price Dublin Gus mentioned is retail so I wouldn't expect the same privately. Here's a <a href="https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/lot/57228/midleton-very-rare-1996-edition" class="postlink">1996 Midleton</a> that sold last week at auction. That's a good price. <br /><br />I probably would look at Auctions for some of the stuff if I was you. <br /><br />Best of luck. Sláinte</div>

				<div class="content">The above poster has forgotten to mention the exchange rate plus commission @ 20% plus vat.

				<div class="content">DublinGus is correct about commissions etc but the seller doesn't get that. <br />That auctioneer only takes 5% from the vendor too. Thy buyer pays 20%. <br /><br />Midleton prices have skyrocketed recently alright. It's worth checking posts in Auction watch for previous results. I haven't updated it for a long time as there are so many sites now and most keep great archives. <br />There are no experts when it comes to predicting auction prices of Irish Whiskey. <br />At that same auction a 60's Redbreast got £410+. Its way rarer than any of the Midletons. In 2015 a 5oz 70's bottle got £400! You couldn't have predicted that one. <br /><br />The lack of boxes will reduce the price. I've a few without too but I don't collect Midleton, mine are from plinths etc.</div>

				<div class="content">Bushmills 1608 400th Anniversary (with case) - 700ml  (Not that rare and was on sale in Aldi last year for circa €65, so value €65 still holds imo)<br /><br />Glenfiddich Special Old Reserve (with tubes, roughly 1980's) -750ml  (Glenfiddich is probably the Biggest Scotch brand sold world wide, However it is not a very collectable distillery due to it's precieved mass market appeal. I'd value it at only €40-50 or else hang on to it for another 10 years and hope.<br /><br />Glenfiddich Special Old Reserve (the same again) -1125ml Although a bigger bottle bigger bottles are even less collectable (unless from a cult distillery like Ardbeg) so value same as above or possibly €60<br /><br />2 Powers Gold Label bottles from the 70's roughly - 750ml <br /><br />The powers are from the 80's and are relatively common and as of yet not hugely collectable. €20-40 each at auction.<br /><br />The Irish Mist Liqueur is an interesting one, I'd hang on to it for a while and do a bit of research if I was you. This is a whiskey liqueur and I have seen people looking for the old version you have. The €250 price tag from Celtic WHiskey shop is a bit OTT but you never know. A very small market but you just need to meet the right buyer. Would be looking for at least €100 on that but you could get more if you get lucky. The other, no idea to be honest ... €30 ????<br /><br /><br /><br />WhiskyAuction.com would be good place to start for prices.</div>
