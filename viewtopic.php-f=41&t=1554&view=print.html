				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />after i got really some good advices and help from some of the members of this forum i would like to ask for some info about a rare Jack Daniels Bottle i have.<br /><br />The Info i was able to find so far in generally below:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Barrelhouse 1 is one of the oldest warehouses at the distillery. Built as one of the first post-prohibition warehouses, it's seven-story design was found to be the ideal elevation for the aging of Jack Daniel's Whiskey.<br />This 750ml bottle was filled with 94% proof Jack Daniel's Whiskey and commemorates the heritage of Barrelhouse 1. <br />This bottle was released in 1994 <span style="font-weight: bold">but then they released about another 200 bottles in 1999 when they found a 'lost barrel'</span><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />This is the only info i found for the 1999 bottle i have. Info copied from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.maxwellshouse.co.uk/unclejack/Jack_Daniels_Barrelhouse_1.html">http://www.maxwellshouse.co.uk/unclejac ... use_1.html</a><!-- m -->  in case someone wants to check as well. <br />There is a forum at this site but they do not accept new members there for some reason so i will try my luck here as i'am sure that in this society could be some active member familar with Jack Daniels, at least i hope so  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />If it's true that there are only done 200 Bottles in 1999, than it should be indeed a rare bottle with at least a good collectors value i think (hope). Having in mind that some are for sure by now already empty i indeed hope it's a rare one.<br /><br />Every additionally info is again more than appreciated, especially the value of this unopened original bottle in it's box.<br /><br />Pics following</div>

				<div class="content">thank you again good_whiskey_hunting,<br /><br />i made a thread/post there as well, but no response, same goes for the whisky.com forum. These forums just seem to be more or less death. Replies are done months are initial post or answer so i doubt i get any value info there.<br /><br />While searching thru the internet and google yesterday i found a 1994 bottle of Barrelhouse 1 on ebay USA which is offered for a Buy Now price of USD 1.100. As there are way more bottles in circulation than my 1999 i just decided to start an auction with a starting price of Euro 999.99 as doubt by new that i will get the info i needed. So just trying my luck that way.</div>
