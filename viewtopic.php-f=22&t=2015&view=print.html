				<div class="content">it'd be a strange move alright. As it stands it's very easy to get stateside and generally promoted as part of their Classic Malts series. That being said I know something like a whopping 90% of what they make there goes into the peating element for Diageo blends and its never had quite the same following that Lagavulin has had stateside so who knows</div>
