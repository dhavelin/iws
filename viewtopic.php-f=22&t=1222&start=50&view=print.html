				<div class="content">I noticed that too. <br /> <br />I heard they're changing labels on some of the lines but I've seen nothing as yet.<br /><br />I know Redbreast cask strength is changing label for the new batch to distinguish it from the regular 12 year old.  You'd think they would do something similar to the yellow spot pre launch, with a coming soon page. Anything to keep us interested.</div>

				<div class="content">History section has been updated '1617' with reference to some detail that has turned up from<br />research in Youghal where Richard Boyle 1st.Earl of Cork had a distillery in the early 1600's.<br />Boyle has recorded in his personal diary what is perhaps the first ever recorded export of<br />Whiskey to the Americas. Sent as provisions for Raleigh's ship on his last voyage of discovery to the Guineas<br />(his friend Sir Walter Raleigh (Lord Mayor of Youghal 1588/89 and from whom Boyle had bought his estate).<br />I do not believe that the SWA will be able to get an earlier reference for an export of this type to the<br />America's !!! So perhaps poor old Walt's failure to find 'El Dorado' etc. may be attributed to his being on the<br />'batter' with 'Choice aquavitae' from Boyle's Youghal Distillery  <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>

				<div class="content">Yes, I quite agree on that. The year '1608' always annoyed me in regards to Bushmills<br />especially when I found a beautiful moulded square whiskey bottle from late 1800's in an<br />antique store that gave'1784'. Many places in Ireland can if the archives are checked show<br />where old stillhouses and maltings were located. in the case of Youghal the location has <br />showed up on old deeds in the oldest part of the town. It's not good enough any more to <br />claim that the history of your brand goes back into the 'mists of time'.</div>

				<div class="content">I wonder will any new bottling be added. I can think of one that would be an addition.<br /><br />I looked at Powers webpage and it their history section<a href="http://www.powerswhiskey.com/discover-our-history.html" class="postlink">HERE</a> it doesn't mention anything about John's lane SPS. I would have thought they'd be ranting and raving about it.</div>

				<div class="content">There have been a few new additions to the site. <br />Here's a picture of the latest Redbreast Cask Strength<br /><img src="http://singlepotstill.com/images/news/2501_0039090.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It looks to be even stronger then the last one. I like the new packaging too. It stands more than the last.<br /><br />I noticed that the society got a mention in the history section for Redbreast, <a href="http://singlepotstill.com/redhistoryyears.do?menuId=6&amp;menuItemId=17&amp;url=redbreast_history_1857_page" class="postlink">here</a> .</div>

				<div class="content">I have been on the lookout for the new Redbreast Cask Strength but have not got it yet. <br />Has anyone?<br /><br />While I checked their shop I noticed Dungourney is now selling at €800  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />I remember buying one for €340 and giving out about it at the time. The last time I looked into getting one it was €430. I should have invested but need food that month!</div>

				<div class="content">They must have been listening to a recent discussion we had about the <a href="http://www.singlepotstill.com/" class="postlink">website</a>. They have given it a face lift. All the whiskeys have stories and even some videos attached. I have spent a few hours reading it and looking at the videos.<br /><br />Some of the PDFs didn't load but that could be my computer, the winder is loose. <br /><br />Very good site, I hope they put some of the archive on line, or better still let me have a tour.</div>
