				<div class="content">I will get the 12 first. Are you not a Tullamore fan in general, or is the 12 just not much better than the regular offering? I have not tried the Select Reserve, but will keep an eye out. Is there anything else in that 40 dollar price range that I should really look for? The list I made is based on the selection at one store I frequent, but there are better selections around if something is jumping out at you as not on my list. Thanks for all the help!</div>

				<div class="content">If you See Concannon Irish whiskey it is by far one of the best valued Irish blends on the US market. Have no idea where it is available though as it may be in a very limited area in relation to the dustribution of the other Concannon Vine yard products. Cheap as chips so Worth a check though.</div>

To me it is very close to the kill began blend underneath which ironically I don't like but the finish makes up for that and seems to make a better whiskey out of the Kilbeggan. Now don't quote me on the Kilbeggan bit just that I think it is a close style before the finish. However it retails for $19.95 in the States which is a steal and well worth that kind f money. I heard it actually seemed to fare well at the tasting.</div>

One of the few areas where alcohol is well priced in Ontario is with respect to Irish whiskey...now if only they could improve the selection!<br /><br />Here's the current inventory listing (including a good sized stash in the neat little city of Kingston, which is at the east end of Lake Ontario, only about 5 1/2 hours from Springfield, as per Google Maps):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/inventory/searchResults.do?language=EN&amp;itemNumber=271106" class="postlink">http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/inventory/searchResults.do?language=EN&amp;itemNumber=271106</a></div>
