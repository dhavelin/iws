My best guess is that this is the rebranded &quot;Avoca&quot; whiskey that was available in  Dunne's (sp?) stores in Ireland, circa mid to late 1990s.  According to Jim Murray's &quot;Classic Irish Whiskey&quot;, Avoca was discontinued in Ireland but then rebranded to &quot;Finnegan&quot; and then exported to the Czech Republic and to the Netherlands.  My guess is that Cooley then decided to export it to the United States.  It showed up in my local liquor store about six months ago.  <br /><br />Edit:  upon further research, it appears that you also have Avoca on your shelves now, in Aldi stores.  <br /><br />There are three varieties of Finnegan available here.  There is a single malt (no age statement), blend (no age statement) and the 8 yr old single malt.  There might be a fourth -- a 8 yr blend -- as well, but my memory is hazy.<br /><br />Interestingly enough I have never seen Finnegan elsewhere in the United States, even in hardcore whiskey shops.  Cask, in San Francisco, did not have it.  Even Park Avenue Liquors, in Manhattan (New York City) does not list Finnegan in its online price sheet.  Yet my local shop has quite a bit of it; last time I was there (3 weeks ago) they had an entire island stocked with Finnegan.  (Just how does Claymont, Delaware get a hold of whiskey that New York City and San Francisco do not have?  Wonders never cease.)<br /><br />It has been a while since I tasted it.  I can post more information on it if you like.  I was going to make a trip back to my local shop in two weeks so I may pick up the other 8 yr appellation and maybe a bottle of the blend as well.  Unfortunately my tasting notes will not be helpful but perhaps I can post some pictures for people to view.  There seems to be a dearth of information on Finnegan whiskey on the internet; even Cooley's website does not list it!</div>

Just picked up a bottle of the 8 yr single malt today, $30 USD.  Importer is listed only as &quot;Wine is Fine, Inc., San Diego CA&quot;.  <br /><br />No idea where this was distilled; no mention of double/triple distillation nor county of distillation.  If I had to guess, it would be another Cooley based on the label's claim that &quot;Black Louth hails from the foothills of Louth County&quot;.</div>
