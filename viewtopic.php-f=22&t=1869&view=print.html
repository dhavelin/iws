				<div class="content">Irish Distillers Pernod Ricard today announced that Barry Crockett, Master Distiller of Jameson Irish Whiskey, will retire this March, bidding a fond farewell to the Midleton Distillery in Cork after 47 years; 31 of which he spent as Master Distiller. The announcement comes, fittingly, in the week in which Crockett was honoured by Whisky Advocate with its Lifetime Achievement award*. Brian Nation, who has been mentored by Barry Crockett for the last ten years, will take over the role of Master Distiller. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.planetwhiskies.com/latest_whisky_news/Irish-Distillers-Master-distiller-barry-crockett-to-retire-after-27-years-6th-february-2013.html">http://www.planetwhiskies.com/latest_wh ... -2013.html</a><!-- m --></div>
