				<div class="content">Earlier a cask strength, single cask, single malt Sherry cask from ye Old Bushmills Distillery. Say that in a Hurry <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Anyway this is just a cracker of a whiskey. Full flavoured but gentle not a sherry monster but plenty of sherry character with out over powering. Even a splash of vanilla in there which you may not expect. <br /><br />Now the same but a sps sample from Midleton. This is a sherry monster ... Rich heavy sherry on the meaty side. Robust and heart warming ... Big and bold and an amazing example of a big whiskey.<br /><br />Preferring the Bushmills tonight though.</div>

I have a couple bottles of Malt Of Kagoshima (single casks) which are the old Mars distillery (some of the whisky from that era is sold as Satsuma iirc). They swapped in 1985 to Shinshu factory and afaik they have used that location ever since and the whisky from there is dubbed &quot;Komagatake&quot;. They restarted in 2011 after a 10 year mothballing and Dramtastic rates the new make (10 months old) very highly -- both a peated and unpeated style. They were going to distill sooner but there was a story about one of the stills being condemned as &quot;dangerous&quot;.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>What distillery might you compare it to?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I was told to expect a Highland Park. On the first sip i immediately thought Highland Park 12 -- power of suggestion?? I do have a recent HP12 sample somewhere and i'll dig it out tomorrow for a h2h. The original 10 came in a porcelain bottle and is apparently superior. The nose on this one is truly  delightful, if they dropped the fake tan and boosted it to 46% it would be up there with the very best there is.</div>
