Good bit of malt on the taste too with heaps of sweet vanilla. <br /><br />Followed by the excellent Blackbush ... Nice richness to this but not as big as the previous drop.<br /><br />Now a laphroigh 19yo Signatory bourbon barrel 53.3% <br /><br />An excellent Laph with the usual Laph character<br /><br />At least the whiskey is good as The Late Late is a bit depressing</div>

				<div class="content">Bunnahabhain Cruach-Mhona tonight.<br />This is a 50 proof Bunny exclusive to World of Whiskies at Heathrow, afaik. Comes in a welcome litre size bottle therefore.<br />What can I say? It's not the sort of dram I gravitate towards, but boy is it good at what it does. Much smokier than your standard Bunny, with a clear iodine note straight off the cork as soon as the bottle opens.<br />The dram is a pale, straw yellow, implying happily that there is no caramel here. On the palate, salt comes quickly, then sweet wood smoke, that TCP, then some faint sour apple and fruit. In fact, where it not for the salty, heavy phenols here, it would bear some resemblance to a Connemara cask strength. The finish goes through cycles of iodine, smoke, tart fruit (as in sour, not cooked) and something like fresh bread dough. It's a complex, boisterous dram, and stands up really well at 50 degrees.<br />Tasted blind, I'd guess this was an Ardbeg or Laphroaig, and I'd have been wrong. Bruichladdich have already showed the big smokey neighbours that they can do peat too when they want, taking it to an extreme with the Octomore releases. This Bunny is less of a gimmick release, and if anything, it's sad that it's a restricted travel retail job, because I think this would quickly win over a lot of new fans to their spirit.<br />It's right on the edge of too smokey for me, really, yet I completely enjoyed it.</div>
