The pair will showcase the best that their city has to offer in terms of dining, socialising, events and activities.<br /><br />Participants in the show get the chance to show off the best of their city's social life, and they will also get to visit two other Irish cities for great nights out, all expenses paid. <br /><br />The most successful pair in hosting a great night out, as voted for by the others taking part, will win a €1,000 city break to the European destination of their choice.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Lorna Hartnett<br />Researcher<br /><br />Waka TV<br />(01) 661-1384<br />085-770-8052<br />0777-836-9818<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rte.ie/tv/audienceparticipation/sixinthecity.html">http://www.rte.ie/tv/audienceparticipat ... ecity.html</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/SixInTheCityire">http://www.facebook.com/SixInTheCityire</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://twitter.com/TV_WAKA">https://twitter.com/TV_WAKA</a><!-- m --></div>
