				<div class="content">Recieved a Power's John Lanes in the post from Flaviar. under €40 to the door  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />I ordered it on the 24th it was dispatched on the 27th and I recieved it last Thursday 2nd, in our times of exacting standards quite slow but if your not in a hurry worth the wait  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> .<br /><br />I was unsure of this crowd for a long while and many complaints of slow delivery times but they seem to have got their act together a small bit.<br /><br />However they do seem to do a lot of Groupon  offers which is usually where all the delays happen. So my advise is don't order during a groupon period.</div>
