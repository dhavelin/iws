				<div class="content">Bought these three minis last night, my first time for each but a must for all Irish whiskey explorers hence my differing choices!!<br /><br />I commenced with the tyreconnell Maderia finish and really enjoyed it, quite sweet yet 46% so a lovely finish on it too! All in all i am an amateur but a great whiskey to say the very least!<br /><br />Bushmills ten year old malt was next on list at 40%: i found it smelt of banana as others had said, tasted very creamy which i liked but again very different to the Tyrconnell! Finish was in my opinion a bit weak, needed more kick!<br /><br />Connemara 12 year old: my first peated whiskey, and i was left disappointed not by the whiskey but my taste buds as did not enjoy the whole peated taste at all but did love it on the nose!<br /><br />No pro tasting above but iv no interest in talking bull either, just my general thoughts on it all! <br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Three nice whiskeys. I haven't had any of them in quite a while. Years since I had a Connemara 12.<br /><br />At the Celtic Whiskey Club blind tasting last week, there was Green Spot, Yellow Spot, Barry Crockett Legacy, Redbreast 12, Redbreast 15 and Powers John's Lane. <br /><br />I was surprised how much I liked the Yellow Spot. My favourites were Green Spot, Redbreast 15 and Yellow Spot, but the were all good. Barry Crockett Legacy might just as easily have got in there. An excellent night.</div>

				<div class="content">Tullamore Phoenix 55% ... Travel Retail â‚¬49.99.<br /><br />Picked up a couple of these in the T2 this week. <br /><br />A lovely rich cask strength (ish) whiskey from Tullamore. It's actually a blend and described as high strength and probably will always be bottled at 55% so technically not a cask strength. <br /><br />Not generally a Tully fan but quit impressed with it so far.<br /><br />This it seems has been finished in Oloroso casks and really rounds it off and does not feel like a finish.<br /><br />The sherry is not over done but sweetens it up nicely feels like honey in there too. Nice bit of spiceyness also.<br /><br />Quite impressed with this.</div>

				<div class="content">Powers Signature Release ...<br /><br />Dont know what price point this will be at ... But I'm guessing under the 12yo John's Lane price. If so this will be a regular me thinks. <br /><br />Blocked nose so not doing well on the nose but if the taste is anything to go by this is a great drop.<br /><br />Smooth and soft on the palate ...<br /><br />There seems to be a glucose sweetness mixed with a wonderful spicyness and a touch of aniseed. There is a bit of sharp dry on the finish too mixed in with all that love sweet &amp; spice.<br /><br />Can't wait to try this on a clear head ...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
