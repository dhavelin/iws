				<div class="content">I'm surprised nobody has mentioned these yet as they have been on the go now for a few weeks. Advertised again in the papers today. I have not had a chance to get any of the new &quot;Specially Selected&quot; releases yet.<br /><br />Aldi currently have a range of Irish Whiskeys.<br /><br />The Avoca is back with what may be a new label @ €18.89.<br /><br />The also have 2 whiskeys in their &quot;Specially Selected&quot; range which is their premium range of food products.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Specially Selected Aged Irish Whiskey</span> (A Blend) @ €24.99<br /><br />The blurb says<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">On the Nose this minimum 8 year aged Irish Whiskey is rich, with sweet vanilla, spice and honey.</span><br /><br />Sounds pleasent enough. <br /><br />and<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Specially Selected Aged Irish Single Malt</span>  @ €28.99<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">This single malt Irish Whiskey is soft and full with sweet and citrus aromas, whilst the palate is caramel infused with toffee and honey and dry oak with lingering dry sweet finish.</span><br /><br />Sounds interesting but possibly too sweet but the finish may conter balance the sweetness if the blurb is to be believed.<br /> <br />If anybody has tasted any of them please post your thoughts here.</div>

				<div class="content">Picked up a couple of the Aldi single malts this morning and glad I did as they were gone in Galway on friday and my local Aldi only had a few left today. Eventhough they are being sold as always available I somehow doubt that Aldi are going to have 3 Irish whiskeys available. I reckon they are for Christmas trade so get yours now or be dissappointed.<br /><br />By the way it says on the back just like the blend &quot;aged for aminimum of 8 years&quot; so I suppose 28.99 is not too bad.<br /><br />Will open one up in a week or so and post back here.</div>

Not sure if I'll be much use if I do it this week with my nose still out of action but you never know I may give it a go for at least the taste as I'm very curious. I have a bottle of lockes 8yo on the go at the moment also.</div>

It is also a good excuse to open another bottle  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />It turns out that the Aldi Single Malt is a fairly decent whiskey. I bought it because of the description of spice in it and it was true to it's word. For me it's better than the regular Tyrconnell and quite different from any other Cooley I've had before. So on that pretense it is not a cheap and nasty  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">I totally agree with you Adrian.  Just because you don't know what a whiskey is doesn't make it a bad whiskey.  We have had some great experiences with supermarket Scotches and ocassionally when a distillery manager lets slip that they recently sold a batch to so and so it all makes sense.  I would have thought the situation with Irish malts was much easier.  There are just not that many places it could have come from (unfortunately).  Part of the fun is in the guessing.  And most importantly if you can get great whiskey for a small amount of money why would you want to pay a lot of money just to get the brand label on the bottle.<br /><br />I must check to see of Scottish Aldis have these drams.</div>

				<div class="content">There is such a thing as a bad malt.<br />Much as I love what they stand for, the Edradour Sauternes finish is a bad malt.<br />That having been said, some of the better whiskeys I've tried, be it Scotch, Irish or Bourbon, were not necessarily the priciest or most prestigious.<br />Just on the Irish front, for what they are it's really hard to beat either Powers 12 yo or Black Bush. Just because in most pubs in Ireland, these whiskeys are available doesn't make them any less special. They're both fine whiskeys that happen to be cheap too, thanks be to God.<br />I haven't tried the Aldi whiskeys, but Adrian and Zoltan have pretty good palates in my experience, and I'd be happy to be guided by them when they suggest looking past the label and the retailer to the whiskey in the jar.<br />If they reckon it's a grand dram, it likely is as far as I can see, and I'm thankful for that but not surprised. Cooley have a reputation for providing decent spirit for supermarket brands, and in this era of premium, super-premium and ultra-premium pricing, isn't it nice to see someone providing something palatable to the most affordable end of the market?</div>

				<div class="content">Yes Willie was it not Tesco's that had a half decent Highland Malt last year or early this year and for 14Quid you could not complain.<br /><br />I've actually had a bit more of the Aldi malt tonight and I'm getting more impressed with it. What impressed me is the fact it is quite different from their Tyrconnell base type malt. I think more vanilla than fruit and the chewy butteriness and spice make it quite interesting.</div>
