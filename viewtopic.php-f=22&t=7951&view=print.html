				<div class="content">I have been unable to keep up - in terms of tasting - with the  multiplicity of new Irish whiskeys on the shelves.  Now I am able to embark on a catch-up exercise and am  therefore seeking the assistance of the Forum in selecting the whiskeys I should try. <span style="font-style: italic">Please exclude Irish Distillers and Bushmills whiskeys as I have kept up-to-date with these.</span><br />Could you recommend one or two whiskeys within each of the following price brackets:<br />Under €45 approx.<br />Under €70 approx.<br />Under €100 approx.<br />I shall limit my purchase to six bottles, though persuasive arguments might extend this.<br />With many thanks in anticipation.<br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'll give it a lash. <br /><br />Under €45<br />• Writers Tears copper Pot. <br />• West Cork black Cask<br /><br />Under €70<br />• Knappogue castle 14 <br />• Irishman 12 single malt <br />• West Cork 12 rum finished. <br />I know I've 3 here but all are interesting and very different. <br /><br />Under €100<br />• Kilbeggan 21. I don't think you'll get a cheaper 21 year old Irish. <br />• Tullamore Phoenix <br /><br />I'll probably think of a tonne more later. I think my prices are close enough. <br />The writers Tears Red Head is around the €45 mark too but I prefer the Copper Pot. <br />I've excluded Teelings too, but they've a few new ones I've yet to try &amp; I don't know the price and I'm sure you're familiar with the core range. <br />Hopefully I'll catch up with you soon Ken. <br />Sláinte</div>

				<div class="content">Many thanks Willie for the lash (disambiguation: not <span style="font-style: italic">flagellation</span>).<br />I now recall tasting some of your choices and agree with them - which augurs well with the others that will be new to my palate.<br />My three price-categories are very approximate of course, but in qualitative terms they can be expressed thus:<br /><span style="font-style: italic">An every-day drink.<br />An every-other-day drink.<br />A once-a-week drink.</span><br />This categorisation could be well extended to include the more expensive whiskeys and expressed in terms of birthdays, significant birthdays, <br />marriage, divorce, etc.  Suggestions as to what the appropriate sequence might be are welcomed.<br />Slainte.</div>

				<div class="content">Good suggestions, especially the Writer's Tears!  I would add...<br /><br />Under €45-The Tyrconnell Single Malt<br />The Pogues'. A little rough, but that's the point!  If you want to go a little Shane MacGowan..<br />Locke's 8 yr<br />Connemara if you want some peat<br /><br />Under €70-Redbreast 12 yr or Lustau.<br />Powers John's Lane<br />Green Spot<br /><br />Under €100-Redbreast 15 (can you tell I like Redbreast?)<br />Yellow Spot</div>

				<div class="content">Many thanks for your suggestions for the under-€45 category.  But those put forward for the other categories are the products of Irish Distillers and therefore excluded from this particular exploration ( see my first posting ).  If I were doing a parallel exercise labelled &quot;Irish Distillers and Bushmills&quot; they would most certainly be there in capitals.<br />Slainte</div>

				<div class="content">Many thanks Adrian. I shall certainly try it and add to my list which is shaping up well. The list should prove particularly valuable in the run up to Christmas when I can pass it to friends / family who wish to buy me a Christmas present and normally don't know what to give me.  All two of them...</div>
