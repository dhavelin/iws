				<div class="content">As we start to plan for our third year, we will be reviewing tastings conducted over 2009/2010 and compile a tentative schedule for 2011 .<br /><br />I am compiling a list of previously submitted tasting ideas for the committee to discuss, so if anyone would like to add any further suggestions/ideas shout now!<br /><br />If you want a repeat of a previous tasting or would like to see something different let us know.<br /><br />Also if you have any views on the balance between the number of Irish and other tastings (Scotch, Bourbon, World etc) we would love to hear from you.<br /><br />The society always welcomes contributions from anyone has bottles they wish to offer for consideration for the society tastings for a price (cost price, fair price or market price) can they please PM me with the list of bottles and what price you would sell them to the society. This will allow us to better plan, build and put together interesting tastings for 2011.<br /><br />Cheers all!</div>

				<div class="content">Ok, how about tasting some whiskeys from non traditional whiskey making countries .... following on from the recent tasting of the Hungarian whiskey.<br /><br />Prehaps a night where we sampled some whisky from Sweden (I've recently acquired a bottle of Mackmrya but not sampled it yet), some from Wales, New Zealand and India might provide a bit of a diverse selection that may not be sampled very often.</div>

				<div class="content">I still think you should run with this and if you would like my personal opinion;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Amrut</span> - good, go with it.<br />Crown Royal - Rather sickly sweet, or at least the standard NAS that I tried.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Glann ar Mor</span> - never tried it, can't comment.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Mackmyra</span> - I have liked all the ones I've tried so far.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Milford</span> - Bonfire night in a glass, or at least for me.

				<div class="content">And a more boring suggestion than some of the above, harking back to some of the earliest tastings. There's a lot of lesser known Scottish distilleries whcih we rarely get to try, or at least I do, as it can be hard to justify buying a full bottle of something you mightn't like or drink. Say some of the lesser known highland malts? Or speyside?<br /><br />When I say lesser known I don't mean obscure, just some of the one's we rarely try in Ireland, eg. An Cnoc, Aberfeldy, Glengoyne, Longmorn, as opposed to Taliskers, Glenlivets etc.</div>

Did anything important happen in 1961, 1911, 1861, 1811, or 1761?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Dunno about the others, but 1811 is a famous year for Cognac. It was the famed 'Comet year', the greatest pre-phylloxera vintage of legend.<br /><br />At the risk of annoying people, I'm going to re-propose my 'Drink like a Dictator' tasting (previously known as 'Whiskey and Politics'). It could perhaps be based around a couple of the higher end Johnny Walker blends, since politicians have tended to have, shall we say, less impressive tastes in the noble spirit.<br />Here was my original list of suggestions:<br /><br />1. One of Mortlach, Johnnie Walker (with optional soda), Locke's: Churchill's favourite whiskies, Johnnie Walker also Kim Jong-Il's and Saddam Hussein's tipple of choice<br />2. Jameson 15 year old pure pot still: The style of whiskey sold by Jameson when Senator Andrew Jameson, the politician, was the company chairman<br />3. Cutty Sark - Lyndon Johnson's favourite dram<br />4. Teacher's - Maggie Thatcher's dram of choice<br />5. Old Grandad Bourbon - President Harry Truman's favourite<br />6. Old Crow Bourbon - President Ulysses S. Grant's whiskey of choice - Lincoln famously asked his aides to find out what brand he drank so as to give some to his own generals!<br />7. White Horse - the whisky Churchill sent to Stalin<br />8. I.W. Harper Bourbon - the whisky Nixon shared with Kruschev<br />9. King of Scots blend, Douglas Laing - Idi Amin's whisky - he used to buy 200 cases at a time to dispense to his men via the infamous 'whisky run' from Kampala to Stansted weekly.<br />10. Michael Collins whiskey.<br /><br />Lots of good yarns to be told about whisky and politics. Could make for an interesting evening. And the drams aren't viciously expensive either.<br /><br />Another possible tasting is 'Whiskey as it used to be'. Let's rattle everyone's cupboards and see what falls out. A Bush or Jameson or Powers from a few decades ago don't cost too much, after all. And I think a lot of people might be really interested to see whether whiskeys have changed much in the intervening decades. We could even perhaps try cross-tasting the old against the new.</div>

And given the times the Mortlach is surprising - there weren't a lot of single malts freely available in those days. Then again if you're the prime minister the fact that something isn't freely available probably isn't an issue.<br /><br />Woudl rationing have applied to government ministers?</div>

				<div class="content">We're talking about the British Houses of Parliament. They have their OWN whiskey! <br />In any case, Winston made sure that there was ongoing distillation throughout the war and during rationing afterwards as he was well aware of the lengthy lead-in time to allow whisky to age.<br />Twas the BBC who said that Winnie's fave dram was Mortlach, by the way. Though he seems to have been fond of whatever he was given. Drank plenty of scotch blends and a touch of Lockes too!</div>

				<div class="content">I've been doing a bit of digging and it appears that Peter the Great may have actually been referring to Bushmills (or in any rate, some North Antrim distillation).<br />He was here on his European tour in 1697, and visited the North Antrim coast (allegedly visiting a distillery there) and stayed at Donaghadee in Down. He is thought to have drank whiskey in both locations. Later when asked, he made his famous quote about 'of all the wines [sic] Irish is the best.&quot;<br />I've also tracked down Hitler's favourite single malt, and discovered that dictators vary in which Johnnie Walker is their favourite.</div>
