				<div class="content">Can you give more detail on the bottle ... just seems a bit strange that 1990 is on a 17yo bottle that you bought in the 90's. Unless it just says 17yo bottled in 1990 which seems odd.<br /><br />However I'm not sure that value would have risen through the roof as Bruchladdich have some many collector bottles. In saying that they do have a lot of collectors of their bottles and if this is one of the earlier bottles it could well have doubled or even trippled in value.</div>

				<div class="content">The Private Cellar range is from Gordon &amp; McPhail afaik, a picture would be great or a full description of the text on the bottle... initial impressions are that it's relatively scarce (presumably single cask?), however if it was just bottled in 2007, then its quite recent and may not have appreciated but possibly depreciated???<br /><br />But presumably it was distilled in 1973 and bottled in 1990 as a 17yo???<br /><br />More often than not the year on the label is the year of distillation... all a bit confusing<br /><br />Also I notice it's a 1L bottle, duty free one-off special by any chance?<br /><br />Speculation... speculation...</div>

				<div class="content">Found a basic description on WHisky Mag so it would appear it was distilled in 1990 and bottled in 2007. If this is indeed you bottle and a correct description of your bottle then it is a modern Independent bottling and therefore will not have rasised in value greatly. The trick in collecting Scotch is buying limited Original Bottles (OB's) i.e. Bottles bottled by the distillery and not Independent bottlers and then you have a better chance of them rising in value.<br /><br />This does not mean that you don't have a great whisky on your hands though ... could well be a cracker.<br /><br />There are distilleries of course that buck this trend like Ardbeg and Macallan but for instance if you had an OB Ardbeg 1977 and a IB 1977 Ardbeg the OB would be worth much more.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Private Cellar Bruichladdich 1990, 17 Years Old</span><br /><br />Brand Private Cellar <br />Expression Bruichladdich 1990, 17 Years Old <br />Type Scotch Whisky / Single Malt <br />Age 17 Year Old <br />Vintage 1990 <br />Abv 43.00% <br />Produced at Speyside Distillers <br />Region Islay <br />Website <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gordonandmacphail.com">http://www.gordonandmacphail.com</a><!-- m --></div>

That appears to be a Distillery released version which would mean a higher value.<br /><br />If this is not like your bottle you cannot compare values if it is identical well  then congratulations  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">But that Whiskyauction bottle is a distillery bottling, 17 yo, with no vintage year specified.<br />If your bottle looks the same, where did the &quot;Private Cellar&quot; and 1990 come from?<br />Either way, a 17 yo Bruichladdich is no bad thing. But whereas an OB might with a fair wind claim a price at auction such as that one did, I have to agree with the others that an independent bottling would not, even though it might well be from a single cask and be a superlative whisky.</div>
