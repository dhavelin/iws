				<div class="content">First impressions - The Glen Garioch 1797 Founders Reserve 48%. There is something very likeable about this. A mass of fruit notes appear halfway through, lychees, passion fruit etc. ( that floral aspect may even be heather? ). Excellent spice right to the death. The fake tan doesn't seem to be a problem on the palate, not yet anyway. It all happens on the palate, the nose is unrevealing and needs time.<br /> <br /> <br />Hazelburn CV. An odd note that reminds me of my uncles car garage, 'oil stained overalls'.</div>

This was really really good. I'll try it again tonight and maybe try and describe it. In fact I'm going to open a few of the Glenmorangies I've had lying around neglected for years - just haven't really thought of it in a long time - it's easy to forget sometimes the the really popular whiskies are often very very good whiskies. (And of course sometimes there not!).</div>

				<div class="content">Finishing an OB Port Ellen 54.3% (6th release 20cl) I really have loved every Port Ellen I've had up to this bottle. I just could never quite get my head around it. <br /><br />Seems quite closed on the nose and to be quite brash on the palate with noticable rough edges eventhough there is a rich mouth feel to this. Buttery lemon, honey and dusty spice ... a bit more like a (cold) hot whiskey than a superlative Port Ellen glad this is now quenched as I have another PE in reserve which I know is a cracker  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>

				<div class="content">Was listening to some Crosby, Still &amp; Nash so had a greenspot to start with ... a great whiskey and this has been open a while. I reckon it has changed in the bottle but it has actually improved in many ways. It has lost it edges of metalic copper and mint and is now lovely and rounded with the sherry more evident.<br /><br />Have now moved on to a more radical tunes and a whiskey to match  Jerry Cantrell (aka Alice in Chains axe man) ... hence Connemara Cask strength  ... a very early tall bottle version. Great guts in this little beast but slightly spoiled by a washing up liquid note in there somewhere which I had not overly noticed before.<br /><br />1970's powers in the wings ... may add a bit to the Connemara before I finish it fully though just to see how I get on.</div>
