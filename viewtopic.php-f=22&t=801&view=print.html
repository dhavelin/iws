				<div class="content">If you had three wishes and could choose to bottle a whiskey, one from each of the three main distilleries (Bushmills, Cooley/Kilbeggan &amp; Midleton) what would you like to see and why.<br /><br />The only condition is the distillery in question has to be able to provide your bottling either now or in the future.<br /><br />Now fire away and let your imagination run riot and your taste buds salivate at the thought.... if only!</div>

				<div class="content">(1) From Bushmills : <span style="font-weight: bold">The Blackbush 8 Plus Aged Blend</span> @ 46%<br /><br />As Blackbush is the 'go to' whiskey for many people, I would love to know what an older blend (say 8-10-12yo with mature grain) in a similar style would taste like particularly at 46% abv. Aagh imagine those luscious sherry tones at a tongue coating 46% abv, it could be stupendous.<br /><br />(2) From Cooley/Kilbeggan : <span style="font-weight: bold">The Greenore Extra Mature 18 Year Old</span> @ 43% <br /><br />Aged grain from the cask, with mouthfuls of banana and exotic fruit, it could be wonderful even better as a single cask. And we know how great an old grain whiskey can be.<br /><br />(3) From Midleton : <span style="font-weight: bold">The Powers Special 15 Year Old </span> @ 43%<br /><br />The Irishman's Irish whiskey, a traditional style high PPS content (say 80%) blend could evoke memories of your grandfather. A cracking dry, flinty and spicy blend, hints of peaches and pair, with a touch of the older style heavy pot still mouth-feel, now would that be a wonderful thing. I can just see it now, walking into the bar, he shouts, A 'Power's Special' please if you don't mind!</div>

				<div class="content">18+ year-old pure potstill from <span style="font-weight: bold">Midleton</span>, whatever the composition. And at an affordable price. <br /><br />There's loads of stuff already available from <span style="font-weight: bold">Cooley</span>, in some shape or form, so I wouldn't know what to ask for there. That 18 yr old grain whiskybro mentioned would be nice. Tried some of that and it was pretty special. <br /><br />And older <span style="font-weight: bold">Bushmills</span> at higher abv. Something over 20.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Bushmills</span>  - I'd be happy to see the single sherry cask back again. Or maybe as someone else said and aged, NCF, 46% Black Bush<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Cooley</span> - Not sure here - maybe an older version of the Madeira finish tyrconnell, or a 15 / 16 yo Connemara from a mix of sherry and bourbon.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Kilbeggan</span> - I'd love to see them try a PPS<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Midleton</span> - Single sherry cask PPS at about 12yo. Or out of pure curiousity a 15yo Single Grain!</div>

				<div class="content">I just read this, so sorry for the late reply.<br /><br />I'd love to see both Cooleys and Bushmill's produce a Pot Still Whiskey.<br /><br />Strangely I like to see Midleton produce a Malt. I like the Irishman malt I tried recently and would like to taste more.<br /><br />Another 15 year old PPS from Midleton would be nice, or will that be a Red Spot?</div>

I'll do you a deal -- here's four:<br /><br />Middleton: Heavy PPS Malaga cask at 10 y.o. cask strength<br /><br />Cooley: PPS with medium to heavily peated malt in the mashbill.<br /><br />Kilbeggan: Flash up the old Tullamore stills, I'll be happy to enjoy it at cask strength at anything older than seven.  Might as well use the Tullamore mash bill too.<br /><br />Bushmills:  Another rum cask.</div>

				<div class="content">Wishing out of the free like this is hard as I haven't tried all what they have but here are some thoughts.<br /><br />Bushmill: I would like to see something with a more robust approach. Maybe a bigger heart or a some peatiness. Maybe reuseing islaycasks? I don't know if that works.<br /><br />Cooley: A SPS of course<br /><br />Midleton: Well, a maltwhiskey would been very nice.<br /><br />Wishinglist:<br />Bushmill: 21y old<br />Cooley: ?? don'tt know<br />Midleton: Barry Crocket Legacy - it's so good</div>
