They were not even sherry-aged, so far as I know (I haven't tasted them).<br /><br />Given that the original Green Spot was entirely sherry-aged (with different types of sherry involved), 10 years old and affordable by the good citizens of Dublin, a modern day SPS, 10yo, lots of sherry influence and keenly priced would be a nice nod towards the independent whiskey bonding heritage.<br /><br />It's just an idle thought. I'm not campaigning for it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Personally I'd leave the contents of the bottle exactly as they are - an expanded range would be fine but I think it's a great whiskey as it is and there's nothing wrong with having a NAS single potstill whiskey available. There are already older SPS whiskeys available anyway. The contents of the bottle do vary from time to time but that's the nature of whiskey.<br /><br />I thinks it's 25% sherry aged at the moment. As for what's traditional it's been in it's current from for quite some time now so I think there's an argument that the current NAS, 25% sherry green spot is the tradition!</div>

				<div class="content">The Mitchell's website didn't put a date on the brand, just saying that it was called &quot;Pat Whiskey&quot; originally and that morphed into &quot;Green Spot&quot; from the label appearance.<br /><br />Certainly by the late '20s, it was called Green Spot and it was 10 years old (from Irish Times ads).</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>IrishWhiskeyChaser wrote:</cite>we can hope that Greenspot can grow as a brand rather than be though of as an expression of a brand</div></blockquote><br />That would be a pity. Almost the entire history of Irish whiskey has been the preservation of brands at the expense of continuity and heritage. So PPS became blend, distilleries shut down, aged became NAS, brands transferred between companies... Green Spot was kept alive for one reason only - that it would be a pity to let the old bonding tradition die out completely. It's great that it made it all the way to today, where it's future seems safe, but if it's just as a brand that can be applied to anything then what was the point?<br /><br />IDL doesn't need Green Spot to be a mass market item. Let's have it as a heritage item so. A little bit of the old days, as far as possible.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes I agree David but I suppose what I was getting at is that if IDL use Greenspot as a brand name we can have other expressions of this on the go too.<br /><br />At the end of the day everything should have it's own identity hence the Brand ... is not Irish WHiskey Notes not your Brand. It really does not have to be a bad word  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Definitely would hope it will always be a fairly small batch operation but imagine a line up of Greenspot, Greenspot 10yo, 15yo and 18yo ... now that sounds yummy  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <br /><br />This would contrast nicely against redbreast with greenspot being far less sherried and possibly slightly lighter in style.<br /><br />While we are at it a Redbreast nas &amp; 18yo also ...<br /><br />I know I'm not asking for much ... I'll just be thankful that they have breathed new life into them wit the Re-Packaging  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> .<br /><br />Anybody see the new Greenspot for sale yet or is still to be released?</div>
