				<div class="content">+1 on the Old Potrero wishlist. I'd love to see one of the High West ryes too.<br />Sadly, I've no ryes to offer, though.</div>

				<div class="content">The Sazarac Straight Rye, as Adrian mentioned, is really good and less expensive than the aged versions. Wild Turkey is lovely too.  Jim Beam is rated very highly too, although I can't remember having tasted it. <br /><br />Then there's...  Oliver Overholt 4 yr old and Rittenhouse Straight Rye (less than 20 euro).<br /><br />The rest tend to be very expensive. <br /><br />The Old Potrero is really good. Not in the same category as the others, as it's a single malt rye, but I'm sure that doesn't matter.</div>

				<div class="content">Some ryes spoken of highly in the latest Malt Advocate: Whistle Pig, High West, Sazerac.<br /><br />I think Whistle Pig is a 100% rye Canadian whisky, which is interesting because Canucks call all their whisky rye, even if it doesn't have any rye in it at all (though there's usually some.)</div>

				<div class="content">Everyone,<br /><br />I think the only rye bottle I have at the moment is regular Van Winkle, not the 13 year old version.  I'll do another check.<br /><br />I have at one stage or other had bottles of Old Overholt, Jim Beam Rye and Wild Turkey Rye, all gone.  It's a while since I've tried any of them.  Very much liked Jim Beam Rye, liked the Wild Turkey, wasn't mad about Old Overholt.<br /><br />It looks like we can source at least six bottles of rye, which is great.<br /><br />If we're not able to get six bottles of rye, I had an idea for filling out the tasting, partly inspired by Gary's &quot;side by side&quot; tastings at the President's selection.  It might be interesting to do a &quot;triple pot still&quot; comparison - compare Woodford Reserve, which is triple pot distilled (the only US whiskey which is, as far as I know) with Redbreast or Green Spot.  If we have enough rye bottles we won't need to do that but we could always try it at another tasting (and compare it to Auchentoshan as well, maybe?).</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Liam,<br /><br />Can you check the label of the Van Winkle that you have  and pass on the details.<br /><br />I picked up a solitary bottle of the 13yo Family Reserve in a shop as I reckoned if I didn't get it now it would disappear.<br /><br />Cheers Leo</div>

				<div class="content">Leo,<br /><br />Turns out my Van Winkle rye is also a Family Reserve 13 year old, sorry about that.  I've about three quarters of a 750 ml bottle left.<br /><br />I cross posted the &quot;triple pot still&quot; idea on the &quot;suggestions for 2011&quot; thread.<br /><br />Liam S</div>
