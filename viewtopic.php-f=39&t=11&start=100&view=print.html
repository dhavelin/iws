I don't know how you get the enery to review all sorts of everything ... I just stick to my main passion of Whiskey eventhough I do like my craft beers and the odd G&amp;T but leave them to others to rave about.

It could well take you many years to amass a full collection depending on your dedication. Midleton RV are possibly the most collectable Irish whiskies so good luck on that and enjoy the journey.</div>

				<div class="content">My name is Jennifer.  I currently live in Idaho, USA.  Within the last 10 months had a long time friend introduce me to Irish Whiskey.  For someone, who does not drink, I like it and dark beer.  So, on this friends birthday, I sent a bottle of Jameson Rare Vintage to him.  Apparently, I am an awesome friend.  I will be going to Ireland/UK/Scotland in August of 2011 and will need to know where to go and what to see.  Definitely will be going to the Bushmills Distillery.  I need to retrieve a bottle of 12 yr from them that you can only buy there.  My friend is a true Irishman with the liver to prove it.  He believes that there is nothing that will make him &quot;warm and fuzzy.&quot;  I am out to prove him wrong.  I need assistance in finding a good stout bottle of fabulous Irish Whiskey.  Something to put a little hair on his chest, but smooooth.  No bathtub stuff. I am not trying to kill him.  haha.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Jenifer, and welcome to the forum ... you indeed must be a great friend to gift a Jameson RVR ... what a wonderful present and what a wonderful whiskey. However your friend has posed you a a quest. It sounds like he is saying everything is a touch too light on the alcohol strength stakes ... well if you want to give him the fright of his life there are many peated cask strength scotches fromIslay that may blow that assumption away. However as a &quot;true Irishman&quot; it will need to be Irish. It is quite coincidental though that there is a Brand called the &quot;Irishman&quot; and they have a <a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/Irish_Whiskey/Other_Irish_Whiskey/Irishman_Whiskey/Irishman_Rare_Cask_Strength_Irish_Whiskey-z-product-recordid-127-context-brand-category-1-country-0-brand-17-distillery-30-page-1.htm" class="postlink">cask strength rare</a> version of thier whiskey out. So this friend who probably thinks all Irish whiskey is easy to drink at 40% may find this a challange as it is a strong 56% in strength. And if you really want to give him a jolt you can go for a Connemara Cask strength too and that is peated. <br /><br />Bushmills in the very notth, Midleton in the very south and Bow St in Dublin all have 12yo Distillery bottle exclusively available only at those various locations.<br /><br />Create a new thread in the Whiskey forum and we can try and advise you on anything you ask.</div>
