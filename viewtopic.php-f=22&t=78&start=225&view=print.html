				<div class="content">I missed seeing that one,Will! Fair price<br />for both buyer and seller as it originally <br />sold for 155 euros when launched which<br />I thought at the time was mad but apparently<br />that bottle was hand blown I think or at the <br />Least very expensive to produce !!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi again folks, sorry for the delay in writing back! <br /><br />I received it as I was due to carry out a project alongside the Boann distillery prior to the launch of &quot;The Whistler&quot; range but it never came to fruition..<br /><br />I will upload a picture shortly of the bottle and letter. I'm actually looking to swap it at the moment if anyone is interested.. I'm looking for a bottle of MVR 14 if anyone happens to have a spare lying around!</div>

				<div class="content">I think the 21 is vastly superior. The TWE bottle was the worst of the ones I've tried so far. The CWS one released from the same batch is outstanding compared to it. It was probably distilled the same day because it's a consecutive number. It was bottled a year later. <br />That's only my opinion. I've yet to try them all. The Friend at Hand is outstanding.</div>
