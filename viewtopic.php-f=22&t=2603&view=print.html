				<div class="content">What will our distilleries bring to the table in 2016.<br /><br />Both <span style="font-weight: bold">Alltech</span> &amp; <span style="font-weight: bold">Dingle</span> have stock that they can sell here now. I'm certain they will have something available.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">West Cork Distillers</span> may have something to sell here too, they released Pogues on the Irish market this year so Frank McHardy has had some influence on them.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bushmill</span> are now free for the clutches of the demon diageo so I'm hoping that they will bring out something. They had some nice samples at WhiskyLive Dublin. The demons sold lots of stock before they pulled out. <br /><br />Most of that stock went to <span style="font-weight: bold">Teelings</span> so I'm sure they'll have some nice whiskeys coming out.<br /><br />I expect <span style="font-weight: bold">Kilbeggan</span> to have at least one out. They have aged Pot Still Stock too so you'll never know.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Midleton</span> are sure to release another few Single Casks under both Midleton &amp; Powers labels. There has been a huge push with Pot Still whiskey in recent years but nothing from their flagship Jameson. There has been rumours of reducing the expressions currently available.<br /><br />I still hope they release a new brand of re-release an old one like Hewitts or a Dungourney Pot Still NAS?<br /><br />I hope that they give us another like Redbreast Mano A Lamh from the Stillhouse at [url=singlepotstill.com]singlepotstill.com[/url] <br /><br />Any thoughts? Hopes? or desires?</div>
