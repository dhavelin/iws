				<div class="content">Good Morning,<br /><br />I found a bottle of this in my Grandmothers garage and was looking to get some information on it, however, I can't seem to even get an estimated price on this vintage?  This is an unopened bottle in a perfect condition box and bottle.  I believe it was kept on the bottom shelf of her garage for the last 20 years.  Anyone much smarter than I help me out?  I heard the distillery had a fire in '95 and lost much of this vintage, but I can't find anything about that.  Any help is appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">No fire T.G. Fires @ distilleries are serious for obvious reasons. 3 of the worst fires in U.K.<br />in last 100 years were Scotch distilleries. Google 'Heaven Hill' in the U.S. --- It was <br />1996. video on you Tube. If you drink Bourbon be prepared to cry !</div>

				<div class="content">Where are you based? AS it will have a major impact on you selling it.<br /><br />I would estimate Circa â‚¬300 Euro as a fair price for both buyer and seller if your in Europe.<br />If you are in the States I'm afraid that you may find it hard to get a buyer never mind these prices.<br /><br />If in the States you can try contacting the US branch of the Society which you can get through the home page.<br /><br />Cheers</div>
