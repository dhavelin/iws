				<div class="content">I am seeking information regarding the value of my unopened Redbreast Pure Pot Still purchased in Ireland April 1997.  It is in original container which is round with a red top and bottom.<br /><br />Fitzgerald &amp; Co.  I can't seem to download the pictures I have taken.  Happy to try and send them to another e-mail if available.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />TNbourbongirl</div>

				<div class="content">A nice bottle to have. Fitzgerald &amp; Co had the brand in the early 90's before it went to Dillon's. <br /><br />They're going up with in value will Redbreast's increased popularity. I've seen them range in auction price from â‚¬90-180. It all depends on the day. There's none on sale that I know of. I know the Celtic Whiskey Shop has one on their site but the price isn't what they'd actually sell it for now if it was in stock.</div>
