				<div class="content">Just noticed that while we were swanning around Kilbeggan on Saturday last, <br />Kilchoman bottled their first malt - <br />from <a href="http://www.kilchomandistillery.com" class="postlink">http://www.kilchomandistillery.com</a><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Bottling of the Inaugural release took place on Monday the 31st of August 2009.<br /><br />The malt was matured for between 2.5 Years to 3 Years in fresh bourbon barrels before being finished in fresh oloroso sherry butts for a further 6 months.  The malt was vatted and reduced to 46% on Islay before being delivered to Houston bottling company in Dumbarton.<br /><br />It will be available from the 10th of September in a select number of whisky retailers in the UK and 13 other markets worldwide.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Many of you will have visited this on an &quot;Ally&quot; visit.</div>

There is an allocation for the U.S. too, so maybe they have some. <br /><br />There's another release due shortly. <br /><br />I was lucky to get a couple of bottles of the Innaugural Release.</div>

				<div class="content">Another hyped up superyoung overpriced malt from a new distillery.<br />You can't blame the distillers from following Ardbeg down this road. It is after all so very lucrative. I appreciate that these start ups require funding from whatever source. <br />But this model is getting very old and tiresome for me now. It's another bubble market at its finest. Does anyone really think that 'Chapter 1' of the English Whisky, or the Mackmyra Preludium, or this Kilchoman release will warrant the same silly prices that speculation makes of them around the time of their release in ten years time when these distilleries have proper aged whisky available for a fraction of the cost?<br />It's a poor long term speculative bet, and as 3 year old whisky, it's unlikely to be superlative. I'll leave this to the bubble marketeers.</div>

And it was only 50 odd euro, which is not a terrible price for the very first whisky bottled at the distillery for general release - a historic bottling in terms of the distillery. <br /><br />You never know what will happen to prices, but I would say this will be highly prized for many years to come. There will be lots of new releases from the distillery, but only one Innaugural release.</div>

Not sure how that works. <br /><br />The original is retaling for up to Â£300 odd now. <br /><br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.abbeywhisky.com/kilchoman-inaugural-release-3-years-old-2009.html">http://www.abbeywhisky.com/kilchoman-in ... -2009.html</a><!-- m --></div>
