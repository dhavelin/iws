Mark Gillespie will discuss the expansion plans, the warehousing anyway.<br /><br />Here's a link with a picture of the <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=5722094&amp;fbid=432159852115&amp;id=46314247115" class="postlink">stills</a></span>. <br /><br />I wonder if a NEWS section would be useful on the forum?</div>

				<div class="content">Some excellent news in there... a long interview though the total podcast is 67mins long.<br /><br />A New Jameson Select Reserve is on the way. And as john says possibly a new Midleton expression.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />I'll try to briefly summerise.<br /><br />Midleton is currently pretty much at capacity.<br /><br />Expansion to Warehousing as widely reported but hints at expansion of the Distillery too.<br /><br />5 large potstills (2 Wash 3 Feints, I think, and I believe I saw a picture of 1 which says 762 h litres (h for hecto maybe) and 7 grain stills and a single but smaller pot still for testing called Mickey's Belly  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Jameson has just hit 3million case sales per annum ... that is 36 million bottles.<br />This is from 2million in 2006 and 1million in 1996<br /><br />24% growth in the US this year and Jameson has hit 1million case sales there alone.<br /><br />In total they bottle over 40+ million bottles of whiskey every year (not sure if that includes Tullamore as I believe Tullamore sells circa 600,000 per year currently but)<br /><br />They Fill over 1000 barrels a day. They import over 100,000 bourbon barrels every year.<br /><br />A high percentage usage of First fill bourbon casks are used on grain. <br /><br />They use over 45 different barrel types.<br /><br />Including Bourbon, Sherry, Port, Maderia &amp; Marsala (Sicily).<br /><br />Their wine cask selection is a very percise process. IDL actually commission the casks from scratch. The wood is chosen 2 years in advance and air dried before any cask is actually made. Then they are shipped to various bodegas and winerys where they mature their wine products from 2-4 years. (i.e. port matured for 2 years and sherry matured for 4years. this means that they have up to a 6 year lead in time before they even put spirit into a cask. <br /><br />Just to give an example this means there is over a 21year lead in time for building up reserves for Redbreast 15yo  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  <br /><br />Over all a very interesting report from mark gillespie and there is also talk on the distilation, cuts etc, raw spirit maturation i.e. PPS matured in bourbon and sherry. A small bit on the history of the place too.</div>

				<div class="content">Really enjoyed this podcast, very interesting and worth the listen. Starts about 8:35 in and finishes around 1:06:10, nearly a whole hour!!!!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />The stats are incredible, filling a 1,000 barrels a day, 100,000 bourbon casks each year, the dedication to quality is a testament to everyone involved and something they should shout a bit louder about. Imagine almost 4 years from selecting the wood for example in a sherry cask to finally having them filled onsite.<br /><br />The only other distillery that goes to such lengths to my knowledge is Glenmorangie.<br /><br />Interesting to note that the bourbon select casks are filled as soon as possible after arriving from the US, incredible supply side logistics.<br /><br />Operating at full capacity for a while now, increases have been achieved by streamlining 'production' lines. Expect that the still house will need to be expanded in the next four years.<br /><br />Whiskycast rated Greenspot, Redbreast 15yo &amp; the (Midleton) Distillery Reserve 12yo very highly. <br /><br />Referred to what sounds like two new bottlings (1) Jameson Select Reserve?  due soon (2) Sample F which may be launched under the Midleton brand in Spring 2011.<br /><br />Fantastic to hear about the success of Ireland's greatest distillery, with exciting developments to come. <br />Great to be around for Irish Whiskey's second Golden Age.</div>
