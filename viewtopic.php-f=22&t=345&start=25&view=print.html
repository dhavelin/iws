I suppose you can celebrate anything. <br /><br />Just by style alone I would of thought that it was earlier but probably 20th century all right.<br /><br />This is all very interesting and it would be great to get a difinitive answer.</div>

				<div class="content">my suggestion is to buy a Midleton very rare 2008 and give that for raffle, and sell this<br /><br />the reason why;<br /> if someone win this and have no idea what it is,then that it is a waiste,<br /> but if someone won a Midleton, then they at least know what they got and happy with it, rather then do not know what they won and what to do with it, and sadly may drink it <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br />but if you want to get the best price for it, get in touch with  <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.whiskyauction.com">www.whiskyauction.com</a><!-- w --><br />they are the best auctioners for rare whiskeys like this, and you guaranteed for the best price, becouse all the collectors waching this site, and i am sure it will reach 1000 euros there easily<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>neady wrote:</cite>Hi everyone,<br /><br />Thanks so much for all the interest shown.

				<div class="content">Hi Neady,<br /><br />I would suggest you do not put this up for raffle.<br /><br />If you are fine with giving this for the school you will realise more money from other avenues.<br /><br />You should easily be able to sell this for a very decent sum to include something like a bottle or bottles of other premium whiskey in the deal.<br /><br />I like JohnM and thee rest of us here  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  would love to own this also but I know it is beyond my means currently.<br /><br />If this is for school fund raising don't raffle it. People buying raffle tickets in general will not appreciate what you are raffling. ANd these sort of events tend to be captured audiences so you'll make your raffle sales anyway.<br /><br />CHeck your PM's</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I was just reading through the posts and Whiskey Chaser suggested that I check whether there were any markings on the bottom of the bottle. I have removed he cellophane wrapper and have discovered two new things. One there is a picture on the capulse that looks like a bunch of grapes and there is writing on the bottom that says Cork Distillers Ireland 67. Does this shed more light on it.<br /><br />Neady</div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately the book I mentioned was no longer on the shelves. darn it...<br /><br />I was discussing this with IrishWhiskeyChaser, and the following info might help narrow down the date range...<br /><br />Both Bushmills &amp; IDL introduced screw caps bottling lines in the late 60s and early 70s, so it must predate this (imo)<br /><br />Secondly, it was not unusual for whisky labels at this time to remain unaltered for long periods (tradition generally prevailed over marketing) examples of labels that didn't change from the 30's to late 60's include the old Mitchells Greenspot 8yo label, John Jameson (not a drop is sold til 7yo) lasted until 1968, Redbreast label was largely unchanged from the 1920s to almost 1970, the Old Midleton 10yo &amp; 15yo label lasted til 1971 and so on. So we can again surmise that we can only be sure that it predates 1970 or thereabouts.<br /><br />The cellophane wrapping may or may not give us clues since it has only been manufactured continuously since the mid-1930s, if we assume it was in more widespread use in Ireland following WW11, and Cellophane sales have dwindled since the 1960s. This if accurate would narrow it down to say 1945 - 1969.<br /><br />Finally the bottle itself, the glass seems to be bubble free, so we are definitely post 1920s in the machine manufactured bottle period, the shape also suggests 1930s+, as early bottles have a more bulbous or bell shaped neck. The 'CDC 67' may or may not relate to 1967.<br /><br />Ok so to conclude, based on the above and your own anecdotal information, it is reasonable I believe to conclude that this bottle does indeed date from the mid-1960s, and being a 20 year old was distilled in the 1940s. I would also suggest that the term &quot;Jubillee&quot; is linked to the age of the whiskey rather than any event!</div>

				<div class="content">Yes I tend to agree with that analysis above. Original excitement re the age has abated some what  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I was linking it with te Bushmills Whiskey of the same name but was probably a bit over exuberant in that regard.<br /><br />However this is still a rare bottle of some value as I have never seen one ever. And the fact it is 20years old makes it more special than your average find from what ever period of the last 60 years.</div>
