				<div class="content">OK, i know i said the 1973 is superb, but i did not had the 20th anniversary that time <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />for those real sherry lovers the 1973 would be the real deal, but for me, who like the sweety tastes more than dry sherry, the 20th Anniversary is the winner <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />i guess this is a blend, but only 400 bottles was released, and as it says on the label and on the cert in box, they have used &quot;some of the original oak casks&quot; which have held the first Midleton very rare, so i guess the youngest whiskey in it is about 13-14 years old and only a few knows what else is in this, but i can not get any of the old pot still character in this, like the 1973<br /><br />i would say there is some old bourbon in it, which gives it's sweaty character and long finish<br /><br />it is 53%, but very drinkable and i would not destroy this with water<br /><br />i am happy with my decision to open this bottle, and partly agree with the premiun brand manager of IDL who said, these whiskeys are made to be drunk and not to collect.<br /><br />i love this, but also have 7 more for the collecion, so i am a happy fellow either way<br /><br />got to taste one of the finest Irish whiskey, and still have some investment in liquid gold <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />i only have one more thing to do <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <br /><br /><br />        i have to shake Barry Crockett's hand  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />...taste even better from the Waterford crystal tumbler provided in the box...<br /><br />my suggestion; <br /><br />          buy it if you can, you will love it too  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Over the Christmas I have been enjoying:<br /><br />Redbreast 15yo '05 batch. Still one of the most excellent whiskeys I have ever tasted.<br />Balvenie 21yo Portwood. Beautiful nose and a deep, full-bodied palate. Wonderful stuff.<br />Highland Park 'Saint Magnus' 12yo. Younger than it's predecessor but I am a fan of HP and this certainly didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Good quality whiskeys enjoyed with good friends and family!<br />Cheers,<br />John.<br /><br />Edit 07/1/11: Sorry, just realised that Balvenie produce both a 40% as well as a 47.5% 21yo Portwood! It was the 47.5% version, i.e. the NCF one, that I opened over the Christmas.</div>

In a fit of ridiculous optimism, I am starting 2011 as I mean to go on. I have here a glass of the original Redbreast 15yo and damn nice it is too. The last one I had was at a society meeting but that was the new bottling and not the same at all. I'm getting the same thing I got the first time I tried it, in Ally's shop way back when: a sweet orange marmalade finish. Very pleasant.</div>
