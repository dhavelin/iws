				<div class="content">Looking for the name of the bar in Belfast that has it's own whiskey (own distillery?) and will only sell it in the bar. I believe there was also a song written about it.<br />Thanks, Dutch</div>

				<div class="content">If it helps, the song as I remember, was about a gentleman who frequented the bar and drank only the whiskey from the bar which was never sold except by the glass, but when the costumer died, they auctioned off a bottle and gave the money to the wife, was the first time they had ever sold a bottle. If I could find the name of the song, I think it's the same as the bar.</div>

				<div class="content">McConville's seems to be still there: see Wikipedia page on Portadown: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portadown">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portadown</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />A lot of pubs would have bought whiskey in casks and bottled it on the premises or served it from the cask, possibly McConville's did this.<br /><br />I have an idea a pub in Portaferry has a special bottling from Cooley.  There are two pubs in Waterford that have their own bottlings still (but aren't saying what's in the bottle).<br /><br />Hope you enjoy your visit, you'll get plenty of ideas for whiskey related places from this site.</div>
