				<div class="content">Hi there John,<br /><br />It is proposed at this stage to have a 'Wild Geese Irish Whiskey' tasting.<br /><br />We are hoping to taste all three different releases which represents the brand since inception.<br /><br />The Wild Geese (Maroon Label) blend c. 2003<br /><br />The Wild Geese (Green Label) blend c. 2005<br /><br />and the new range launched in 2007.<br /><br />The Wild Geese Irish Whiskey Classic Blend <br />The Wild Geese Limited Edition Fourth Centennial<br />The Wild Geese Rare Irish Whisky<br />The Wild Geese Single Malt<br /><br />This shows what being in the society is all about, getting to taste whiskies that otherwise we might not all get to try<br /><br />I think it is an interesting line up with something new for everyone</div>

They try to kick off asap.<br /><br />The room is a function room upstairs so ask a barman for directions but it is a door at the back of the pub to the left of the toilets door. Then up the stairs and down the corridor and  there is a door on left with some opaque leaded glass (I think) and bob's your uncle.<br /><br />Should  be a few of the guys in there organising the tasting anyway so you'll be fine if your a bit early. Just introduce yourself and you'll get the low down on the club and the tasting. <br /><br />David will you be there ... I know I won't  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">I should be there. That's impressive memory work describing the interior of the bar from our Galway correspondant but the bar is actually called Bowes, on the eastern stretch of Fleet Street.<br /><br />No need to bring anything along (does anybody bring their favourite tasting glass? I haven't noticed that) except a little cash to cover the cost of the whiskeys. You might like to have a pen and paper to record whether you like each sample or not, for future reference.<br /><br />I still don't know most people who come to these things. I always end up sitting beside someone I haven't met before but it works out because we at least have the whiskeys to chat about. So just plant yourself anywhere and go with the flow  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
