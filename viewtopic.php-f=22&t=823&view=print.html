				<div class="content">I agree with John M the 12yo is a close jameson relation - not as good as the 12yo Jameson but a close but slightly less interesting cousin. <br /><br />(Reading that sentance back to myself it has all sorts of strange connotations - but you get my meaning.)<br /><br />I'm no fan of the standard Tully, I find it very harsh, and I didn't like the 10yo Malt - I like the whiskeys that went into it but they didn't work together for me - so the 12yo is really the only one I'd drink. Not the most exciting whiskey but a grand pot still blend.</div>

I haven't tried it.</div>

				<div class="content">I like all 3 Tyrconnells - the madeira is the favourite but they're all good. I really really didn't like that 10yo Tullamore Dew malt - it doesn't really make sense - I'm going to vat the 3 tyrconnells soon for comparison. I think you're right about the 10yo blend but I've never tasted it.</div>

				<div class="content">yea, there are 2 10yo's.  the blend and malt.  i heard neither are really worth the extra money over the NAS.  i am interested in the 12yo though.  already have a jameson 12yo distillery and special reserve.  this is off topic, but does anyone know if its legal to ship opened bottles from ireland to america?  my entire collection is still in ireland with my wife.  shes not due over for a few months and i dont think its legal to bring opened bottles on the plane.  this could be a major dilemma.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /></div>

				<div class="content">just pulled the trigger on the tullamore dew 12 year old.  i see what you guys mean when you say it falls short of the jameson 12.  its a lovely whiskey, but is lacking that extra bit i am looking for in a 12 year old.  its got the classic pure pot still blend taste of spicy, woody, nutty with a hint of vanilla/honey.  its almost like they tried to make it more approachable than the powers/jameson 12.  i would definitely buy it again if it was on sale though.  the lack in taste explains why its a tenner less than the jameson.  i really wish tullamore would get in the game a bit more.....</div>
