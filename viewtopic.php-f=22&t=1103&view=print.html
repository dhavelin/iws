				<div class="content">The bartender course on Whiskey tasting, serving is an incredible idea. I only started really getting into whiskey about 9 months ago. In that time I've learned an incredible amount but would still be an amateur compared to most on this forum. I've also built a solid collection, of both whiskies and books. But have met only a few other bartenders who show any interest in our national spirit. The bar I work in is a magnet for tourists and they love learning (the little that I can tell them) about Irish Whiskey. So many bars in town are missing out on this niche.<br />Be sure to post the details about the training course when you have them confirmed.<br /><br />F.A.O Michael. <br />Congrats on the nomination. I have been in the bar several times but only ate there for the first time 2 weeks ago. Perhaps my boasting about it clinched it for you.</div>
