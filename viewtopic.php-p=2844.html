                continental countries do?

                Mmmm... The term 'Pure Pot Still' is disputed as I understand
                it.<br /><br />&quot;Irish Pot Still&quot; or perhaps
                &quot;Green and Malted Pot Still&quot;?<br /><br />Mmmm... God,

                Has anyone actually tasted this? For all we know it could be
                fantastic. It could be the pure pot still we've all been waiting
                for!<br /><br />Seriously though if we try to protect the
                &quot;pure pot still&quot; tag could Scotland not try to protect
                the &quot;single malt&quot; tag? Where would that leave 2/3rds
                of our distilleries?<br /><br />It would be interesting to know
                how it's made and what it's like. If I recall correctly there
                was an Eddu which was distilled in a pot still which used a mix
                of malted an unmalted buckwheat in it's mashbill. Is there any
                reason this couldn't be called a pure pot still?

                No, Scotland could not protect single malt as a term. 'Scotch'
                on the other hand...<br />The issue here is that this is a
                product with a defined history and traditional artisanal
                creation method located in a defined geographical area - ie
                Ireland.<br />The belated emergence of bullshit like the bottle
                above is very recent, and a clear attempt to universalise the
                term in a similar way to single malt.<br />Pure pot still
                whiskeys are a traditionally Irish product, and the distinction
                between them and even Scotch whisky goes back at least a century
                or two.<br />You're right to say that currently there is nothing
                stopping anyone anywhere in the world from bottling anything
                they like and calling it pure pot still.<br />But good luck to
                anyone trying to bottle a fizzy white wine and calling it
                Champagne if they're not a designated winery from that area of
                Northern France.<br />Maybe it's just my idealism, but I don't
                understand why our heritage products should be bastardised the
                world over when other EU countries wouldn't countenance it
                happening to theirs.

                Fair enough but I suppose one could argue that the term Pure Pot
                Still is a description of the manufacturing process as much as
                the place of origin. Yes I'm all in favour of protecting our
                heritage but sometimes I think these things can be taken too
                far. For example the SWA attempting to prevent a Canadian, and
                an Irish distillery from using the word Glen.<br /><br />I think
                it would be useful if the term pure pot still was defined in the
                context of Irish whiskey. The protection comes from the
                &quot;Irish whiskey&quot; tag, with the appropriate explanation
                of the type of whiskey attached, be it PPS, Single Malt or
                blend.<br /><br />I don't think the comparisson to Champagne is
                the same thing at all. This is a specific place. If an Austrian
                whiskey producer attempted to call a product Dublin whiskey then
                I could see a problem.<br /><br />I don't think this is an EU
                issue. It's more an issue of lack of interest in one of our
                domestic industries, over a long period of time, by pretty much
                every government since the foundation of the state!

                I kinda agree with you Iain ... even the scotch industry back in
                the old says have been known to use the term Pot Still (but not
                with oure) to describe their product. It was a way of
                highlighting that their whiskey (Now known as single malt) was
                better spirit made in a pot still rather than a patent still
                produced whiskey or cheap blend.<br /><br />However I believe it
                is the Irish Whiskey industry it's self that have let this
                slide. However I don't think it is an issue for any government
                to create a legal definition but for the industry to push for it
                which they are obviously not interested in doing.
                <br /><br />For me with the amalgamation of the Irish Whiskey
                Industry into IDL created a seige mentality. This was probably a
                correct course of action back in the 60's but we have a modern
                dynamic world but IDL seem determined to stick with their mono
                direction of Jameson. Until the attitudes on Irish Whiskey
                change in IDL things will stay pretty much the same for a long
                time.

                Yes, I believe the running for a DOC application to the EU would
                probably have to come from a distiller (in this case IDL) or
                from the relevant government department here.<br />I think
                DOC-ing the term 'Irish Pure Pot Still' or 'Irish Pot Still'
                whiskey would be really useful as it would help identify and
                associate this particular and superlative style of whiskey with
                its place of origin, and would help the industry here in
                distinguishing itself from the Scotch behemoth as an alternative
                location of whiskey heritage and quality.<br />It might also
                inspire Cooley, Bushmills or others to bring more PPS whiskeys
                to market.

                I'm a little late to this discussion i'm afraid but I certainly
                agree with jc's view that there ought to be some sort of legal
                clarification established to protect the notion of PPS whiskey
                as whiskey made from a mixed malted/unmalted mash run through a
                pot still. As I'm sure you all agree, the style itself is a
                national treasure with its own tremendous flavour possibilities
                and, without a protected definition, it's re-growth and
                development will continue to be repeatedly undermined by
                bottlings like &quot;Locke's Pure Pot Still Single Malt&quot;
                etc that distort this definition and prevent the casual public
                from becoming more aware of it. With Kilbeggan producing again
                and the Dingle project underway, this century has begun with a
                much kinder start for Irish Whiskey than its predecessor and the
                sheer establishment of this society is a testiment to Irish
                Whiskey's reemergence from what IrishWhiskeyChaser so
                appropriately called the 'siege mentality' of the post downfall
                IDL years. It is vital at this early stage that the industry
                itself make legal clarifications about labeling and content if
                we are to see the diversity of Irish whiskey preserved and
                enriched. <br /><br />However petty the SWA may be (and yes,
                they're a pretty petty bunch), they've done excellent things for
                Scotch whisky by using protected terms and specifications to
                preserve specific styles and to ensure that you know exactly
                what you're getting in the bottle. For example, when I buy a
                &quot;Famous Grouse Blend&quot; I know that its a mixture of
                different malt and grain whiskies whereas when i buy a
                &quot;Famous Grouse Malt,&quot; I know full well that its a
                vatted malt because they havent been allowed to label it as a
                single malt. And yes, we all know that &quot;Single Malt&quot;
                itself is a rather novel term in the wider history of whiskey
                but it does its job and it does that job well. If the term PPS
                needs to be replaced for something that's more literally
                exclusive, i'd be rather sad to see it go because of its
                historical association, but i'd rather that then the current
                state of affairs.<br /><br />Personally, I think that the
                apologist argument that &quot;Pure Pot Still&quot; still applies
                to single malts because they are &quot;purely made in a pot
                still&quot; and thus conform to the literal wording is a bit
                ridiculous as, in truth, all cultural terminology of any sort is
                established through the arbitrary association between a phrase
                and its historically implied meanings rather than through the
                jigsaw application of all of a phrase's possible meanings to all
                of the possible employments. For example, almost all single malt
                scotches are made through the mixing of the contents of separate
                casks to establish consistency. This means that they're being
                blended together, right? so why not call them blends? Should two
                grain whiskeys mixed together make a blended whiskey? No, and
                its the acceptance of this set vocabulary that allows both the
                industry and its consumers to move forward and explore the
                variety of each style's flavor possibilities on their own
                terms.<br /><br />I also agree with JC that the establishment of
                a set PPS qualification and a subsequent broadening of the
                public consciousness of the style as a distinct alternative to
                the single malt might encourage distilleries such as Cooley and
                Bushmills to produce PPS expressions of their own (Bushmills of
                course even have an old historical connection to the style.) At
                such a promising time for Irish whiskey, such a diversification
                of the PPS whiskeys generally available would go a long way to
                giving this most peculiarly Irish style a place on the same
                international stage that Single Malts have stepped onto in the
                last 20 or so years.

                In addition, I agree that the push for a maintained standard
                definition probably has to come from inside the industry itself.
                Unless i'm mistaken, IDL have never really made an effort to get
                a legal definition affixed to the phrase and, to be honest,
                despite being its only current producers i feel that they tend
                to seriously neglect it in favor of their mainstream blends. If
                the Dingle group are as intent on producing PPS as they say they
                are, than maybe the initiative will come from them, although the
                last information i heard from them was in a prospectus
                (discussed in the Dingle Distillery topic) that seemed to blur
                the terminology line in the opposite direction.<br /><br />As
                for the national specifications, i'd be far more worried about a
                legal name for the style itself than its origins. I'd fully
                support legal restrictions on &quot;Irish Pure Pot Still&quot;
                in the same way that there are restrictions on &quot;Single Malt
                Scotch&quot; but i think the most pressing issue vis-a-vis the
                term itself is to standardize its production implications rather
                than its origins. (for example, Cooley's &quot;Magiligans Pure
                Pot Still&quot; is a thoroughly Irish product but if someone in
                a remote country distilled whiskey from a mixed mash of malted
                and unmalted barley in a pot still, i'd consider the latter a
                true PPS long before the former.) Curiously enough, I was
                flipping through Charles MacLean's history on Scotch whisky the
                other night and he mentioned that, aside from all the Scottish
                stuff that was dubiously run through Irish customs houses and
                then shipped out as Scotch, there were a few genuine expressions
                of Pure Pot Still whiskey made in the lowlands by distillers
                trying to meet the demand for the drink back in its 1860s
                heyday. Specifically, Caledonian, which at the time was the
                second largest column still grain distillery in Scotland,
                installed two pot stills in 1867 specifically for the production
                of PPS whiskey from a mixed malted and unmalted mash etc. Even
                before that time, it seems to have been quite common in the
                lowlands during the late 1700s to have used mixed mashes in
                their stills. In &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; for example,
                Scotland's own Adam Smith talks about the lowland industry by
                remarking that &quot;In what one called malt spirits, it [malt]
                makes but a third part of the materials; the other two thirds
                being raw barley or one third barley and one third wheat.&quot;
                I remember hearing that the original Irish PPS whiskeys
                sometimes used other grains than barley in the unmalted section
                of the mash which seems rather similar to Smith's description.
                Anyway, just an odd historical point that i found interesting
