I'll explain to anyone who contacts me. He asked if I could do it for him, so I hope this is okay. <br /><br />Apologies if this seems shrouded in mystery. I can vouch for the seller. <br /><br />I think the asking price is â‚¬500.<br /><br />Anyway, I will give contact details if anyone is interested. The bottle would have to be posted from Munich. Here are some pictures:</div>
