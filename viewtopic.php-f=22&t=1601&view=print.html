				<div class="content">So... What was it like?  Any craic?  What was the crowd like?  I know who was there and who was not there.  What we want to know is was it any good?  How about the Masterclasses?  Did anyone get to try that whiskey they always wanted or find anything new?  <br /><br />What do you think of Whiskey Live Dublin 2012?<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />or<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /></div>

				<div class="content">I thought it was good, but I preferred it last year. Would have been better if Bushmills had turned up, along with more Scottish distillers. It was really like being at a &quot;free&quot; bar, well stocked with whiskey. If other distillers had the same presence as Cooley and IDL had, it would be better. But Ireland is so small, it's probably not worth it for them.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes John, I think that is the biggest issue it will have, Variety, as it was very much the same as last year. Only for Ally in the Celtic Whiskey shop and his selection it would probably be quite disappointing. It's great meeting all the Irish Industry people but from the whiskey point of view it could get very boring if IDL &amp; Cooley are the main anchors all the time. I had tasted all the Cooley stuff before and Yellow Spot was the only one I wanted to taste from IDL. So I spent the majority of my time at Ally's stall. Can't believe I missed Jefferson's again this year  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />However it is always great to meet the people and that in itself is enjoyable but if you can't enjoy a few hours drinking whiskey well then there is something wrong  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />I got the VIP ticket and thought it was not really worth the effort. Basically the VIP Tasting was the main benefit, which I did enjoy. The food was small and the same as last years regular food. The VIP lounge was the same as the VIP eating area and basically was a cramped balcony overlooking the event which I don't think is acceptable. And I could take or leave my free tasting notebook. I can't think what else I got from my €57 and it could have been worse at €69 if I had not got a discount. So I may have to consider as to whether to go at all next year?<br /><br />But yes it was enjoyable ...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  We missed the big Yank though  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

Essentially we got the same stuff last year as regular attendees, plus a couple of miniatures, which we didn't get this year.  There was a bit more food than normal tickets and than last year (cheese and little desserts.)  I didn't get the magazine.  We got sunglasses in the goody bag.  It also wasn't clear what the &quot;special VIP pourings&quot; were - that should have been stated (maybe I missed it but I didn't see it mentioned anywhere.  Michael F mentioned there was one at his stand, but I asked another stand and they said no.  So the difference was food and the class.  I'm not sure it was worth the extra money from my viewpoint.<br /><br />When I got an email about a survey I sent a message to ask were we supposed to get something else on the way out but apparently not.  I think they were a little hurt that I wasn't entirely happy.<br /><br />Absence of Bushmills is very disappointing.  As against that, nice to taste the Yellow Spot, the Black Bull at Michael F's masterclass (I preferred the 12yo to the 40yo myself), the Imperial at the Whisky Mag table, and the Kilchoman at the CWS table which I hadn't had before.  And absolutely, IWC, it's great to spend a couple of hours drinking whisk(e)y and meeting friends.</div>

They had a logo for yelp.com.  What samples did the people in your group get - was that the VIP pourings?</div>
