				<div class="content">Hi All, I'm new here and just looking for a bit of expertise please! I came across a few bottles of 12 year old Redbreast from the seventies at home i found the whiskey retailing for â‚¬400 on celticwhiskey.com and I was just wondering what would be the best way to sell them or would it be better to hold on to them? Any advice would be much appreciated thank you!</div>

				<div class="content">If your on Facebook, there's a page for Irish Whiskey - Buy, Sell, Seek Swap. If you have photos to confirm the date. <br /><br />They have sold between 250-300 at auction. <a href="https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/lot/015376/redbreast-12-year-old-196070s" class="postlink">https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/lot/015376/redbreast-12-year-old-196070s</a>. This would have fee deducted and the exchange rate to account for but I think my prices are close. The shop price will be higher to account for VAT and costs. <br /><br />Best of luck with them. I'll send you a PM too.</div>
