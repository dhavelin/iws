				<div class="content">I'm really not keeping up with my task list these days. I have finally updated the event page for the Japanese tasting:<br /><br />  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/events/2012/2012-04-26">http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/even ... 2012-04-26</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It was a noisy room, and not private, so we didn't do the usual voting. I have a feeling, however, that the Karuizawa 15yo would have taken the honours. For me, the Nikka from the Barrel just shaded it though. I might have been influenced by considerations of relative availabilty/cost.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the tasting. It seems we will be hearing more about Japanese whisky in these parts so it's good to get the drop (ha ha) on it.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, I would have liked to have been at this but that's the way. Japanese whiskey is highly regarded and old Karuizawa's are one fire with single casks selling out very quick when they come on the market and they are not cheap. <br /><br />Thanks David  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
