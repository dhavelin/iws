				<div class="content">Guinness opens up about any whiskey for my palate.  I tend to save the high end for special occasions.  Because I am currently exploring a variety of whiskies, I enjoy a number of new attempts with a solid pint of guinness to enhance the experience in a positive way.  The moisture from the guinness allows me to really soak in the new and often foreign tastes.  Happy drinking, everyone.</div>

				<div class="content">Over here in the US, a lot of people are into a &quot;shot-and-a-beer&quot; mentality. I've never gotten into that, as I don't need to chase down my whiskey. If I didn't like the taste, and had to chase it, I'd drink something else.<br /><br />I'm the type who would have a medium American lager beer (Budweiser is a good example) to quench my thirst. I don't drink whiskey to make thirst go away, I drink whiskey to enjoy it. <br /><br />If I go with a Guinness, I'll stick with that, and leave the whiskey alone until next time.<br /><br />However, I am open to new things, so I might take that list posted above and experiment with whiskey and beer combinations.</div>

Even though both would have the same amount per pour a shot is seen as something you knock back in one go ... The majority of people in Ireland that drink whiskey and beer do so in a much more relaxed frame of mind. The whiskey and beer are both savoured in tandem and the whiskey would last the length of the beer or visa versa. Further Whiskey is very rarely drunk with larger as (In my mind anyway) they don't really compliment each other. Stout and ales seem to go well with whiskey though. t would be interesting if you could expand on the shot and beer mentality in the US.</div>

				<div class="content">Some beer and whiskey coming up at the society. Sounds interesting. <br /><br />The newsletter, though, calls the whiskey the chaser, though. A chaser is the beer or something else you drink with spirits. You chase it down to soften the blow.</div>
