				<div class="content">I was there in January and didn't hear a thing. Most of the buildings are intact and plenty of room for a Distillery. It was many times bigger than the Dingle Distillery site. <br /><br />This is great news for whiskey in general.</div>

				<div class="content">I still have those photo's willie and i can put them up here if anyone's interested. Bandon's a curious one because they made both malt and pot still whiskey during the original boom (theres still a bottle in the nearby pub). Any way of contacting these people and seeing if their interested in taking the thing seriously David? I'd love to have a word with them about their intentions for the book</div>

				<div class="content">Good article from the Irish Times --- this is the bit though that I have difficulty with as I picked <br />up a bottle of this some time ago believing that I had bought an Irish whiskey ?????
