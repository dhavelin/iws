				<div class="content">After receiving Jim Murray's 2011 Whiskey Bible I was somewhat surprised to see  Jameson receive a 95 rating. As I usually use Jameson for hot whiskey I thought I would give it another go and I still don't get it. Lovely sharpish taste but the finish just disappears. I would not rate it that highly. Had a trusted Redbreast 12 and a Bowmore 10 which really overpowered everything and left me sorry for having it.</div>

				<div class="content">Glendronach 15, ( a sample - cheers Steve ). Burnt rubber on the nose, quite dominant. Something of a recovery on the palate, and a better finish.<br /> <br />St. Magdalene 17 1981 CC 43%. Another sample, and fine stuff.<br /> <br />Springbank 15 OB 46%. A fine dram, even the lightest whiff of sulphur doesn't spoil it. I love the oranges and good balance on the finish.<br /> <br />Caol Ila Natural Cask Strength. The ever reliable, and not noticeably tanned. That'll do.</div>

				<div class="content">The Bushmills Black Bush - I could spend hours going on about the attributes. I can't get over how wonderful it is. It is the most perfect whiskey I have found so far, regardless of price or age, single malt or blended. It hits all the right notes for me, every time.<br />I have yet to taste an Irish Whiskey that I don't like. Original Bushmills or Jameson are great, too.<br />I finally found a bottle of Bushmills 1608 400th Anniversary, which I have tucked away for a special occasion. It will likely be the only bottle of that I will ever own. I also got a bottle of the Bushmills 16 year. Although excellent and interesting, especially from 3 different casks, it still does not measure up to Black Bush in my estimation.<br />I think my next purchase will be the 12 year Red Breast. I have heard many wonderful things about that one.<br />Of course, I will always be sure to have a full bottle of Black Bush on hand!<br />Cheers,<br />Carl</div>

I meant Irish Distillers, not Midleton. When Knappogue and Clontarf merged, they consolidated their sourcing with Irish Distillers, which owned Bushmills at the time. Their contract is still, last I heard, with Irish Distillers, even though Bushmills moved to Diageo.</div>

The Balvenie 15 Single Barrel is a huge improvement though, not only because it's 47.8%, but better all round. The H2H2H of these three showed the DoubleWood to have 'sour' woody notes.</div>

I was never a huge fan of the Glenmorangie 10 or any of the standards so I don't know what possessed my to go on a Glenmo buying binge - but they've all been great. Also I've a tendancy to op a bottle, have one or two, and then not touch it for months so I've decided to continue wiht the 1977 as a regular until the bottle is empty. I'm really enjoing it though, so it's no hardship. Shares some of the attraction of the Bushmills Millenium - very different whiskies of course, but the uncluttered bourbon cask with loads of understated complexity had a similar appeal.</div>

I think I prefer the latter, which is unfortunate as that's the one with only 2 measures left. <br /><br />And that's what I'm starting with tonight. Now that I think of it it's not a bad idea to start a tasting session with the final one of a previous tasting session - I think you can be more objective on your first drink and it's interesting to compare to the impression from the previous tasting.<br /><br />Wasn't there an ancient greek custom of deliberating on all important decisions twice - once sober and once drunk.</div>
