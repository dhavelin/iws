				<div class="content">Just to let you know I think Oak has a slightly diferent purpose for whiskey than for say wine. I'm no expert in wine but I guessing you know all about that. But indulge me a moment  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  both grape and oak produce tannins and I believe aditional wood tannins are seen as a positive taste profile in wine. Therefor oak helps to interact with the wine and develop it. I know very simplistic and I'm sure there is much more to it than that <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />However oak tannins are not desireable in Whiskey. By law American whiskey has to be martured in new oak barrels and cannot be reused. To counter act the tannins in fresh oar barrels they char the inside of the barrel. The char does a few things ... 1. it creates a barrier between the whiskey and the oak but at the same time allowing interaction. The charring also carmelises the wood and enhances the vanilla charachter that it can impart on the whiskey and even spicey notes. If your not in a position to charr at least mature some wine or cheap bourbon in the  barrel first and that will hopefully draw out some of the stonger tasting tannins first.<br /><br />best of luck wit hthe project and be sure to let us know how you get along</div>

				<div class="content">Certainly maturation in wood is the key to creating a drinkable whiskey.<br /><br />European Oak (ex sherry) &amp; American White Oak (ex bourbon) are the traditional casks used in Ireland.<br /><br />Assuming you cannot get an European oak then a Bourbon barrel is the obvious choice for you.<br /><br />Barrels generally are treated in two ways (1) sometimes lightly toasted or (2) charred. Charring is measured in degrees of charring,<br />You can have a 1-char, 2-char or 3-char (this being the depth of the char inside the barrel).<br /><br />The char is very important as it filters the impurities in the whiskey and helps the taste develop due to the interaction between the wood &amp; the spirit. The seasons also play a part in developing the taste with expansion in the summer and contraction in the winter (spirit moves in and out of the wood). Not to mention evaporation. So your local climate will also have a huge bearing on the final product.<br /><br />If you cannot get a barrel you will have to experiment with <span style="font-weight: bold">seasoned</span> oak cubes or staves.<br /><br />A good book/chapter on maturation should help (or a visit to a friendly microdistillery)<br /><br />Best of luck and keep us posted on your experiments.</div>

				<div class="content">This topic has certainly grabbed the imagination  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />However I think the main problem here is the small volumes that are being created hence propper casking is not an option.<br /><br />I seasoned a litre oak cask a while ago with sherry for 3 months and then matured a 3 year old cooley whiskey for 6 months. The whiskey certainly matured but the oak still over powered more than slightly.<br /><br />I have planned to mature clear spirit but the cask dried out and it ha cracked a bit on one of the tops  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  need to see if rehydrating will reseal it.</div>

				<div class="content">Well all this response has me realising that i must first try to understand a  bit  more about Irish Whiskeys in general.<br /><br />I am going to  buy a  book on what irish whiskeys are available. as far as the actual  aging i will have to try a small barrel althoug i can easily  control the oaking by placing only a very small amount of  chips into a gallon jug and removing them  very quickly as soon as i see the  stuff get a little  bronze in color--i left the last  bunch of  chips in too long.<br />  i really know that i wont be able to come up with somethin that would be called excellent  but i will try to learn one style and tweak that if i can. i used vanilla and glycerine on my last batch and was told it was  vey smooth with a  faint wiff of vanilla.<br />the over oaking did in fact subside as the whiskey sat on the shelf for a few  months.<br /><br />i will now  back out for a while because i have 26 pounds of  bacon to smoke,slice and vac pack in the next few days-- I also want to run my vodka wash soon so i am free to go and purchase the  grain for  my next whiskey mash.<br /><br /><br />Just let me say  how gratefull i am for the responses and friendliness. In a couple of weeks i should be mashing an all malted barley mash single  malt  . i will take pictures and document the  thing from purchase of grain to aging and  bottling.<br /><br /> right  now i need to dis apear for a time--  I actually cant wait till i get to the point where i  start posting again.<br /><br />Meantime i will read as  much as i can on this site and try to collect a  book or two  that is specifically dedicated to Irish whiskeys<br /><br /><br />meantime <br />thanks a  million<br />SCOTTY</div>
