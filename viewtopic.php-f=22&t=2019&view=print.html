				<div class="content">Just noticed something on the label of the Writers Tears I picked up on the 'Pont Aven' last month (Cork-Roscoff)<br />(Duty free on this boat is stocked from U.K. side primarily as it normally does the U.K. to Santander run). Same <br />label as the one I got last year in CWS, Dublin except that the latest label says 'Pot Still' whereas the one from last <br />year says 'Pot Still Blend'. Rest of the label and box is completely unchanged. Anybody know reason why as I don't <br />recall hearing of the change taking place??????</div>

				<div class="content">hey Raven, you might already be familiar with all this but nobodys ever really come up with a name for what goes into Writers Tears, as its basically a mixture of Midleton SPS with the ever elusive Midleton malt whiskey. It's not really a blend since there's no grain whiskey in it and its not really an SPS or a malt. They used to call it just &quot;pot still&quot; casually but maybe Midelton have been cracking down on the term now that they're promoting SPS abroad? To my knowledge, the contents in the bottle havent changed.</div>

				<div class="content">Complete agreement on that score. i also believe that it is a case of <br />monitoring the label and safeguarding possibly the SPS category. Heard<br />nothing about the contents being changed etc.</div>
