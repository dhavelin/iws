				<div class="content">Hi. any guess what the value of a Midleton 15 yr old whisky, labeled &quot; Finest Irish, distilled and matured by Cork Distilleries Compy Ltd. bottled by M.D.Daly &amp; sons, Tramore Road. Cork&quot;. This was purchased by my late mother in law pre 1964 and is sealed and seems in perfect condition. Was wondering whether it would be infamy to open and serve at a family wedding for guests who might be philistines.</div>

				<div class="content">Here is the pic from Spiller54<br /><br /><a href="http://s16.photobucket.com/user/Birdman1099/media/3da26c0f-6fd8-44a3-9567-ab7dae767587_zpscsyux5hp.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b2/Birdman1099/3da26c0f-6fd8-44a3-9567-ab7dae767587_zpscsyux5hp.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br />(Spiller54 added the following on the pic.)<br />. I should add the following. On the top left corner of the label, my late mother in law marked &quot;pre 1964&quot; in small writing as an aid to her memory of the purchase date. she had worked as secretary to Mr Smith in Smiths Stores which evolved/amalgamated into the present Musgraves.  Also I note that in the Celtic whiskey shop website under the Irish Spirit section page 7 is a very similar bottle with the only difference being that it was not bottled by M D Daly. I have an email from Irish Distillers, who I queried, advising that Midleton used supply whiskey in bulk to M D Daly for them to bottle and retail it with labels also supplied.</div>
