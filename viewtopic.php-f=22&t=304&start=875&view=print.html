Personally i dislike the entire company from Jack Daniels to Canadian Mist to Southern Comfort. That being said, the woodford reserve distillery itself is a bit of a diamond in the rut. Jack Daniels have a really terrible habit of filtering whiskey and presenting that as a premium product. in my opinion they sell liquor like petroleum and advertise whiskey like vodka, convincing many that what they should be looking for is not interesting flavour but rather no flavour at all. The whole 'so smooth you can drink it straight' line of thinking. Its not so much the sheer presence of bottom shelf spirit which is fine and, of course, inevitable so much as the fraud of products like gentleman jack etc and the money they pour into advertising a luxury culture of nothing at all that gets on my nerves. It actually really irritates the hell out of me.<br /><br />On the subject of woodford reserve, i'm very happy to see the pot still return to bourbon where it used to be king although, again, its frustrating when the bosses at BF pull a stunt like the one iain mentioned above. i'd just like some honesty from them</div>

				<div class="content">I think the blending of different bourbons under one brand name is prefercly legal in the US. Sure you could argue it is somewhat misleading. Then again, how many people are aware that Jameson isn't actually made in Bow st - every bottle has that address rather than the cork one.<br /><br />What about Bushmills blends using grain whiskey from Midleton? <br /><br />Or the fact that whiskey labelled as Kilbeggan can come from either Kilbeggan or Riverstown?<br /><br />Ireland isn't exactly up to scratch on clear and trasnparent labeling either.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, I can understand Fionnáin's frustration on corporate waffle and premiumisation of mass produced non premium products. However that is the world we live in and it is up to us to educate people. Not that JD is crap but that there is better out there. Personally I think there is space for everything and the big mass produced stuff creates the money for the small batch quality stuff. This became especially apparent with IDL on the flogging of Jameson to death around the world and doing an amazing job on it too might I add. However the up shot of this is the resurgence of SPS as a category which may have never happened only for the success of the lowly blend that is Jameson. <br /><br />Iain you also have an excellent point on the lack of clarity even with in the Irish industry and it is also rife in the Scotch industry. You will see very few main stream scotch blends proudly displaying the fact they have at least 5,10,15, 20, 25% malt content etc  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />No harm keeping the pressure on though  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />unfortunately it is a double edged sword. In a crowded market it is necessary to invest in massive promotion and that can cheapen a product in our eyes. Then success brings demand which can actually affect the product too. In whiskey terms that usually means younger whiskey. It's a very hard line to draw and which side do you put your product on ????</div>

Unlike Scotland, blends in Ireland are NOT clearly labelled as such. Yes there's rules about using the terms pot still or single malt, but you don't have to specify if something is a blend. To the casual eye you could suggest that some of the IDL labels do suggest pot still whiskey.<br /><br />And what about Kilbeggan?<br /><br />In fairness I should have been clearer about something at the start - not all versions are blends with Early Times but the standard ones appear to be, at the moment.</div>

				<div class="content">oh absolutely Iain-- dont worry, i have problems with plenty of practices on this side of the atlantic as well... and, again, i do appreciate the fact that woodford reserve distillery exists at all. I've learned to make the most of the slippery labeling etc, its just the lying to my face that i really dislike on brown forman's part. they also do some kind of kentucky derby promotion for example in which they claim that 'woodford reserve is the official bourbon of the mint julip' and then promptly sell official mint julips etc made with earlier times, seeing no problem between these two decisions. it just really starts to get under my skin after a while.<br /><br />In contrast, I would point at Jim Beam as a better example. Jim Beam is not good whiskey but it certainly foots the bill and allows them to make things like Knob creek, Basil Haydens and Bookers which are excellent bourbons (bookers especially imo). Say what you will about &quot;jim beam&quot; the product and its associated brands like jim beam rye etc, Fred Noe (and Booker Noe before him) really do care about whiskey and they use those profits to preserve some rather incredible stuff which they smartly sell under entirely different labels. This, in my opinion at least, is closer to the IDL model and should be commended. Its not the presence or the popularity of JD that i dislike so much as BF's premiumisation etc out of thin air with things like &quot;Gentleman jack&quot; etc.</div>

				<div class="content">I've never really given BF much thought before now - I don't mind JD as a rough and ready drink sometimes and would generally prefer it to the standard Jim Beam. On the other hand, as you rightly point out, Jim Beam make a range of very very good whiskeys - I've tried a few of those listed and they're certainly superior from almost anything I've tried from the BF stable, Woodford Reserve apart.</div>

				<div class="content">oh absolutely-- i've always been a fan of beam as a company. They're a bit like an American grant and sons in that they're a large operation (large enough as we all know to invest in buying something like cooley) that are still centered around whiskey and run by the beam family (even to the point that the distillers are still family members... the Noe bunch are descended from one of the beam sisters.) I've spoken to Fred Noe once or twice and he's very passionate about the real stuff and very proud of the fact that his dad was one of the great believers in the rebirth of premium bourbon in the US before small batch and all that became popular. As sad as i was to see cooley sold, i'd much rather see them in the hands of a company like beam then say, well, Brown Forman.</div>
