				<div class="content">... of whiskey. Not sure exactly what the beef is but I heard his promo for this afternoon's show. He said it's €20 for a litre of Paddy in Dunnes - less than Duty Free. The equivalent volume of whiskey would sell for €160 in a pub (if I remember right). Anyway whiskey, supermarkets, pubs, prices... The Liveline is open now!</div>

				<div class="content">Only reread this now ... surely the Paddy in question is the 70cl ???<br /><br />Then you have a scenario that there are only 19 x 35.5cl measures in a 70cl bottle @ say 3.80 measure would equate to €72.20.<br /><br />Would not surprise me one bit that he'll take the wrong end of the stick as usual.<br /><br />Anyway Paddy is in general 32.99 for a litre as per Tesco.ie on-line and if it is on special it should not count.<br /><br />That man exasperates me  <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />How he is paid such a large salary is just beyond me ...</div>

So RTÉ... no, wait, that's not right...<br /><br />Anyway, Joe is on now. He has resurrected the signatories of the Proclamation to reflect on our sovereign right to buy Irish whiskey with Irish punts, or something.</div>
