				<div class="content">Hey all, just received this email from Ally:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Starting in February we will be running a series of monthly tasting evenings exploring whisk(e)y from around the world. Presented by Michael Lawlor of the Celtic Whiskey Shop these will be informative but relaxed events with plenty of variety and some really interesting whiskeys to try. Initially, there will six evenings, with each one focussing on a specific whiskey type or them. Details of the first evening are listed below.<br /> <br />Please feel free to pass this email on to any colleagues or friends that you think may be interested.<br /> <br />1) An Introduction To Whiskey<br />Date: Thursday February 9th, 2012<br />Venue: Against The Grain, Wexford Street, Dublin<br />Starting Time: 7:30pm<br />Tickets: €20 in advance from The Celtic Whiskey Shop. Numbers Limited.<br /> <br />Michael will present some of the world’s easiest drinking whiskeys including 3 Irish, 3 Scotch, 1 American and 1 Japanese. This is a great chance to taste a diverse mix of whiskeys from the major distilling countires. Expect some great craic, fine whiskey and some rather corny jokes from Michael!<br /> <br />Subsequent evenings will focus on Irish Whiskey, Scottish Whisky, Emerging Nations, Hidden Gems and finally Islay Single Malts. These dates are 15th March, 12th April, 10th May, 14th June &amp; 12th July.<br /> <br />Please note that tickets must be bought in advance from the Celtic Whiskey Shop.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Sounds good to me <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
