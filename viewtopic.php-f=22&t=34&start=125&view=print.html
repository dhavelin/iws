				<div class="content">Prices are pretty high here in British Columbia. The Bushmills Black Bush  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> - my personal favourite - is $36.99CAD = 27.60euros. Still, it is a cheap price to pay even over here for such a wonderful whiskey. We don't get a lot of discounts on spirits here, two or three dollars on occasion. The only exception, is at one liquor store downtown, they discounted the Bushmills 16 year by $14.00 the other day. Needless to say, I picked one up.<br />Still, not complaining. We are able, at least, to get a substaintial number of the various whiskies over here. Also, the Bowmore 12 year old Scotch single malt at $60.00 is really pretty good for the quality. Funny thing, I was offered a Bowmore 18 year old on New Years at a local Italian restaurant, and really didn't like it as much as the 12 year old. I am finding a lot lately, travelling down the Avenue of Whiskies, that I am generally preferring the younger ones.<br />cheers,<br />Carl</div>
