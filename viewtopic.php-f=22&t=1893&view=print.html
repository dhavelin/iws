				<div class="content">I am very excited to have seen the LCBO website list Connemara CS (again!) @ $97, and...(drum roll please)...Turf Mor (58.2% abv) is now in Ontario!!!  I thought that since is a fairly limited production bottling, that it would never make it over to Canada.  It has, and at $87, it is now my next target for purchase...hopefully by the end of May.  <br /><br />Though, for a limited production bottling, I am surprised to see that over 800 bottles are listed in stock currently, across the province.  At that quantity, I likely will hold off on the purchase, and pick up the Compass Box Oak Cross that is almost sold out.  Either way, the Turf Mor is a wonderful surprise addition to the limited LCBO inventory of Irish whiskey!  <br /><br />Does this represent a new batch of Turf Mor, or is it stock from the original release a couple of years ago (2010??, iirc)?</div>
