				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />Delighted to discover this board and I am eager to learn more about good whiskey. <br /><br />I am 30 and though I have drank whiskey for a number of years I've only gotten into it with more serious interest in the past year. Up to that point I only ever really had tried the usual Jameson, Powers, Jack Daniels<br /><br />Anyway over the past few months I have tried Redbreast, Green Spot, Writers Tears, Connemara Cask Strength, Tyreconnell, Irishman, Greenore. I also like bourbon and have picked up Woodford Reserve, Wild Turkey, Jack Daniels White Rabbit Saloon and Makers Mark. <br /><br />Looking for some recomendations for some nice whiskey for Christmas, Will check out the other sections to see if there is a thread about that. <br /><br />Looking forward to talking to you all, <br /><br />Slainte!</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome Raoul ,<br />I hope you enjoy the forum.<br /><br />You've tried  some nice Whiskeys already. If you can get your hands on a bottle of Powers Johns Lane SPS it would make a great Christmas present to yourself.<br /> I'm going to get a couple of bottles in for myself because I was very good this year.<br /><br />Another great new Jameson is the Select Reserve. Yellow spot is nice too but not easy to find.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi folks,<br /><br />My name is Ray, i'm 39 and only recently developed an interest in whiskey after buying myself a bottle of Writers tears in the Celtic Whiskey Shop. Before that I would rarely drink regular Jameson. I then bought myself a bottle of Knappogue Castle and am currently trying Greenspot for the first time. I find the potential in Irish Whiskey very interesting and I have often surfed these forums for information so I finally joined today so I can join in on the very well informed discussions.<br /><br />I also found over the christmas that christmas cake and greenspot is a nice combination<br /><br />happy new year</div>

				<div class="content">Hello to all and thank you for this forum.  I'm Dave from the Arkansas USA.  I'm one of the fortunate visitors to Ireland.  On a chilly June Day 2010, we were late for the beginning of the public tour at Locke's in Kilbeggan and so  my wife and I took the time to wander around the distillery on our own.  We decided to not fall in with the group tour in midstream so made it a point to avoid the &quot;tourists&quot;.  It turned out to be a most fortunate decision.  We were pleased with the openness of the distillery and the freedom to take our time looking at the historical exhibits.  We literally left no door unopened.  One of the doors I opened was to the distiller's office.  Thinking this was also a historical exhibit I just barged right in.  I was embarrassed to find that it was not an exhibit but the the office of Mr Liam O'Keeffe the Master Distiller.  He was standing just inside the door going over some papers with another distillery employee.  I made sincere apologies and started to back out the door when he stopped me, asking if I had missed the tour.  I explained our circumstances and he said &quot; Let me show you around then.&quot;  I told him I did not wish to impose and that we had seen several of the exhibits already. Being an extraordinarily nice person, he offered to show me the things that we had not seen.  One of the most exciting was not on the tour but was behind the only barrier in the distillery.  We walked through the barrier to find the new Mash Tuns that were just being installed so Locke's could begin Primary Fermentation again.  I was so impressed by the significance of the moment that I asked if I could take his picture in front of the Tuns.  He was pleased to let me.   Afterwards he told me that these were the first photographs ever taken of the Tuns before they were put into operation.  We went back through the barrier and he spent several minutes explaining the operation of the 2nd and 3rd distillations going on in the hallway.  He described the history  and refurbishment of the oldest copper still in the world.  He fetched a little glass and gave me a sample of the final distillation and then, at length, told me what I was tasting and what it would over time become.  I was allowed to stand there and soak up the smells that remain in my memory to this day.  We then turned around he explained to me how he performed one of his first jobs as a young man in the cooperage shop.   If you will follow the  link  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.kilbegganwhiskey.com/place/">http://www.kilbegganwhiskey.com/place/</a><!-- m -->  You'll see Mr O'Keeffe standing behind the former distillery manager Mr Quinn.  The history, traditions and distillations of Kilbeggan and Locke's Distillery are in the safe hands of one of the nicest men in Ireland.  I made it to Tullamore Dew and Jameson's in Middleton.  In my years I have toured some  of the Kentucky and Tennessee Distilleries.  Kilbeggan is the most memorable.  In the ignorance of youth I should have been better educated in the subtilty's of what I was tasting.  Several years ago I set aside all of the bourbons, sourmash and scotches more readily  available and thus more displayed here..All in favor of Irish Whiskey.  I have converted more than a few friends to our stuff.    Green Spot is hard to find but worth the effort and Paddy is in some of the larger cities.  I could go on but let me do that in some of the other forums.  I'm happy to have this opportunity.</div>

Kilbeggan was always a very friendly place and everyone who worked there was happy and proud to show you around and to make sure you got to see everything. I haven't been back there since Beam let people go but I hope that atmosphere survived. It was very special.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />From Issaquah Washington.  I was trying to explain the difference between Scotch and Irish Whiskey to a friend, and while looking for some details I found this site.  I started out a Bourbon nut, and it has expanded over the years.  My Irish tasting has been limited to Bushmills 10, Black Bush, Powers Gold, Tullamore Dew, Tullamore Dew 12, Knappogue Castle 1992, Michael Collins Single Malt, and Red Breast 12.  I enjoy them all with Red Breast my favorite.  I like the Michael Collins Single malt but the peat really sets it apart from the other bottles as far as the flavor goes for me.  I look forward to expanding my Irish experience.  I still don't quite understand the different grains, or how the fermentation/distillation process sets it apart from Scotch maybe someone can direct me to a site that offers an laymans understanding?  <br />As far as Scotch goes, my favorite is Aberlour A'bunadh. I have tried some Glenmorangie, Macallans 18, Glenlivet 12 and Glenrothes Select.<br />I have started stocking up a pretty good Rum offering.<br />Bourbon was my gateway drink and I have probably 50 bottles in my cabinet.  <br />Anyway, I look forward to learning more about Irish Whiskey and I look forward to expanding my tasting history!  Thank you for this site.<br /><br />Todd</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Todd, nice to make your acquaintance!<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>T47 wrote:</cite>I still don't quite understand the different grains, or how the fermentation/distillation process sets it apart from Scotch maybe someone can direct me to a site that offers an laymans understanding?</div></blockquote><br /><br />It's pretty much the same as Scotch as far as the fermentation, distillation and maturation goes. The big difference is that in Ireland we have an extra category of whiskey called &quot;pot still&quot;. That's where malted and unmalted barley are mashed together and fermented. So, while we have &quot;single malts&quot;, like Scotland, we also have &quot;single pot still&quot; whiskeys.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome Todd,<br />That sounds like an interesting drinks cabinet. I would prefer the Redbreast over the other Irish Whiskeys you mentioned too.<br /><br />The Power's John's Lane is exceptional Whiskey if you can get your hands on a bottle. It's also a Single Pot Still.<br /><br />I like your taste in Scotch, the Aberlour A'bunadh is great whiskey. I only tried it recently and really liked it, but it'd creep up on you.</div>
