				<div class="content">Yes, old whiskey jugs can get big money regularly. However it is a totally different type of collector involved in these bids usually. Obviously some whiskey collectors will bid for whiskey jugs but there is a huge community out there that only collect jugs and others brewery/distillery memorabilia. It is a very big market but you really need to know you earthenware from your pottery and a lot of the time it is down to the rarity and maker (Potter).<br /><br />Very interesting area but a vast knowledge base is required.</div>

The first item in the thread, The George Roe Jug went for a crazy price. I seen the whiskey for around the same price.<br /><br />Some of the others were very high I believe. Those Pins and badges were good value. I've ones like them and they took me years to find. I cant see that many exist because they were very small.<br /><br />Its certainly an interesting area for collectors. I'm sure lots or people here have some great examples. I have some nice stuff I collected over the years. I've nothing as exotic as the ones here apart from the badges.</div>

At €150 I'd say it was a good price. I've noticed the Arklow jugs are getting harder to find lately.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey folks, haven't been on here in a while.<br /><br />I have a few items I'm looking to sell, hopefully face to face, I'm based in Dublin. Sticking it up here as I think it falls into the Memorabilia category.<br /><br />I have 4 water jugs; 1 Guinness, 1 Carrolls Cigarettes and 2 Tullamore Dew which have little cork/porcelain stoppers on top.<br /><br />The official Scotch Whiskey Nosing Aroma kit, only used once or twice and still in perfect condition with all original packaging.<br /><br />And 14 books about whiskey, ranging form the History of Locke's Distillery to Whiskey &amp; Philosophy.<br /><br />For a full list of the books I have and for any photos you want, drop me a private message here and I'll get back to you. Hoping to shift everything I have for 100 euro, so if you think you'd be interested drop me a message.<br /><br />Martin.</div>

				<div class="content">This Jameson jug was on eBay.  It didn't sell likely because it was listed at ~€400.  I ended up making a deal with the seller for a much better price.  I've been trying to do some research on it with some limited success.  &quot;Pearson &amp; Co. Whittington Moor Potteries near Chesterfield&quot; has beginnings as early as 1810 I believe.  It may have only taken the name Pearson &amp; Co. in the 20s.  It survived until 1994.  This is what I found but I was hoping someone else might know more since the date range is so large.  I was able to find old examples of the company's stamp but not the one on this item.<br /><br />I haven't found anything on Wrigley Bros.  Anyone know of them?<br /><br />Finally, was curious that it says Bow St. &quot;Distilleries&quot; and not &quot;Distillery&quot;.  Don't know if that's significant.<br /><br />If anyone can add any info I would greatly appreciate it!</div>

				<div class="content">I was on Adverts earlier and seen a empty bottle of Jameson Distillery Reserve. It was one of those bottle you could put your name on or someone else for a present. <br />This one had Mark Zuckerbergs name on it with the<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;Description:<br /><br /><br />This was a present for Mark Zuckerberg made in the Jameson Distillery, Dublin.<br /><br />It was for a tech conference last year but he never arrived. What else was there to do, can't let good whiskey go to waste. It has since been drank by other CEO's <br /><br />Cracked open by Mike Butcher, TechCrunch Europe Editor in the Shelbourne Hotel&quot;</span><br /><br />I thought this was a joke but sure enough someone bought it for €20. I wonder will this bring out more empty bottles with famous names on them.</div>
