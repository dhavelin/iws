				<div class="content">Oh My God, what a Bourbon.<br />I have finally found a whiskey that gives me a huge (but very smooth) hit of caramel, toffee and vanilla on the taste  but also delivers a great lengthly smooth finish again with tons of vanilla, milk chocolate and toffee. It's full of flavour but not too overpowering. It's a full 53.5% abv<br /><br />Superb wood with fruit and spice on the nose <br /><br />I thought I had died and gone to whiskey heaven!<br /><br />Can't wait to try the 20 year old</div>
