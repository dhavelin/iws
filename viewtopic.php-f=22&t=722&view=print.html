				<div class="content">Gentlemen (and Ladies!)<br /><br />Does anyone out there in the ether have any information on Mitchell's Pure Pot Still whiskies other than the brief descriptions on Mitchell's website?<br /><br />The range consisted of Blue Spot (8YO), Green Spot (10YO), Yellow Spot (12YO) and Red Spot (15YO).<br /><br />In particular I'd be interested in photos of the above bottlings.<br /><br />Of course a <span style="font-style: italic">taste</span> of the above would be even better...<br /><br />Over to ye!</div>

				<div class="content">Howdy Luke. Not a lot of info out there I'd say. I think Jim Murray's Classic Irish Whiskey may have mentioned them but whether there was any more info than the Mitchell's site I don't know. You could try popping into the shop and asking one of the family.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Luke,<br /><br />Looked into this once and the last reference to anything other than Greenspot was the 1920s, <br />can't remember which one was available then,<br />when I get a chance I'll check it out for you.</div>

				<div class="content">As far as I can remember, there were empty examples of these Mitchell whiskeys on display in the Findlater vaults in Harcourt Street, under the old train station. That was about 15 years ago. I wonder what they did with the little museum display that they had there?  I shall make enquiries within the trade and report back. Regards from Kilkenny</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there Luke,<br /><br />The latest and only reference I can find is from a Mitchell &amp; Son advertisement from April 1924,<br /><br />&quot;Whiskey, 7 yrs old (22 U.P) (Blue Seal) 174/-&quot; per doz. [presumably the blue spot]<br /><br />At the time &quot;Green Spot 10 Year's old&quot; was 180/- per doz.<br /><br />At this time Mitchell would classify all spirits/wines by a system of coloured seals indicating increasing price/quality.<br />They had Red, Green, Blue, Black, Brown, White, Yellow etc obviously not all used in relation to whiskey!<br /><br />For any further information you would have to go to the Mitchell's archives... cheers</div>
