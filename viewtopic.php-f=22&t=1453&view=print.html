				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />Just like to give ye a heads up on a new Independent Bottling Business.<br /><br />Many may have heard of Raymond Armstrong who is from Northern Ireland and owner of Bladnoch, currently the only independently Irish owned distillery in the world  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> .<br /><br />Martin Armstrong is his son and has set up Whiskybroker and sells single cask bottlings and even full casks if youve got the finances.<br /><br />(Something the Society possibly could look into in the future years)<br /><br />Martin offers single cask whisky from various distilleries as he gets them. These are usually well aged expressions and are very very keenly priced.<br /><br />Check out<br /><br /><a href="http://www.whiskybroker.co.uk/" class="postlink">http://www.whiskybroker.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Just be aware that you need to keep an eye on the site as certain offerings can sell out fast.<br /><br />For example a 43yo Tomintoul and a 37yo Stratmill sold out with in an hours of release. These sold for £60 &amp; £50 respectively which is amazing value.</div>

				<div class="content">They have lots of BunnHabhain 20 anf 21 year old, which if you like heavily sherried whiskies... The Strathmill and  Tomintoul were great value. I was lucky enough to get some, as the price meant it just lasted 20 hours.</div>

				<div class="content">Very much doubt it at this stage. But in time if his business grows nicely he possibly might do it.</div>

				<div class="content">Raymond, who I suppose he's kind of taking over from with the bottlings, was saying he regretted not buying a Cooley cask when he had the chance, so maybe not Beam have taken over it's not as easy to do?<br /><br />Bushmills or IDL don't sell casks.</div>
