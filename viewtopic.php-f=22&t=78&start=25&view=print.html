				<div class="content">Dammit!  So many whiskies; so little time.  <br /><br />Some great collections of whiskey there guys.  There's a very limited selection of Irish available over here, but its improving all the time.  Nevertheless my queue of bottles waiting to be drunk is nearly all Scotch, with a few Irish, Japanese and other world whiskies.  I never seem to get round to cataloguing it though. <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>

				<div class="content">It's taken me a long time to accumulate so many different bottles, however no matter how small or large your collection, don't be afraid to post it here. Thats my pared down list, I've taken out duplicates and minor variants. I could name another 20 bottles that I would dearly love to have in my collection but the fun is sometimes in the chase.<br /><br />I have up to now focussed on getting as many different bottlings, however I'm now at the stage where I'm buying to drink, taste and develop my palette. <br /><br />I could have gone in a different direction and laid down half a dozen bottles of things like the redbreast 15, jameson 1780 or Jameson 15YO PPS but i elected to collect first and drink second. Others like IrishWhiskeyChaser and JohnM are coming at Irish Whiskey from a different direction. But the thing we all have in common is our love for Irish Whiskey.<br /><br />Remember it can be an expensive hobby and the society is a way of broadening the enjoyment in a more affordable way.</div>

I must admit to being quite amazed at some of the collections set out above. I initally started collecting after being given a bottle of whiskey as a present and it started out as a pure investment but I have since realised that each bottle is a little piece of history, especially the bottles from distillerys which have since closed such as Port Ellen. Finally Dara,Michael and everyone in the Celtic Whiskey Shop have been very informative and have helped to foster my interest in uisce beathe!<br /><br />          Peter<ul></ul></div>

				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />Just because the Port Charlotte topic has come up and please forgive my ignorance on the brand, but can anyone expalin what the hype is about with this range? For one, I don't believe that they are around long enough to have a proven quality or is it simply because of the association with Bruichladdich <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />  Sometimes I am amazed at the reviews given to the six-year old version; batch size was 18,000 bottles (not what you would call a small release) and retailed for approx. £125.00  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />J.</div>

If the whispers that they intend to do this regularly are true I won't be supporting it. <br /><br />I feel that the Whisky market is going to change in the next year. Collecting is being hit hard by the recession and going by a very popular Whisky forum there seems to be a lot of people selling collections to get by. Interesting times ahead.</div>

				<div class="content">I have not been buying as much as I used to. I used to look at a whiskey and buy it on impulse, whether I can afford it or not. Now I only do this 80% of the time. I'm a recovering alchoshopoholic. <br /><br />Look at the prices of Midleton special releases. The 20th anniversary is a blend. It doesn't even say what's in it. Yet it's thousands.

				<div class="content">Hey all,<br /><br />I've only started so it ain't even big yet lol.<br /><br />So far I have:<br /><br />Jameson 12 Year Old<br />Redbreast 12 Year Old<br /><br />I've got some Mini's too <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.<br />Jameson Miniature Collection: Crested Ten, Jameson, Jameson 12<br />5cl Connemara<br />5cl Connemara 12 Year Old<br /><br />I've also been meaning to ask if anyone would recommend a breakfast Whiskey but was too wary about asking it as I thought I'd get an answer somewhere along the lines of &quot;You do know that Jameson sell marmalade, yes?&quot;.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />I haven't opened any yet. I'm just waiting until the time is right for me plus I want to build my collection up.<br /><br />Was supposed to get a bottle of the apparently fine Redbreast 15 Year Old today but am going to get it in the morning now. I can't wait, I've never tried it and it may be a while before I do too... I'm going to open it when I feel I'm ready for it.<br /><br />I've also got my eye on a bottle of Greenspot, I've heard some great things about it. I might just get a standard bottle.<br /><br />I have been talking to IrishWhiskeyChaser and he's helping me through the process <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />. So I'm going to develope my palate first before I delve deep into the fine art of Collecting Whiskeys.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd have to say a breakfast or for horsey types a hunt whiskey would be Greenspot or Powers.  Rounded substantial whiskies but not overpowering.  <br />Of course you should always do your tasting first thing when your palate is fresh, thats why fancy wine tastings can start at 8am.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for both replies guys. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />I bought the Redbreast 15 yesterday for a nice price of 99.99euro in Redmonds, Ranelagh.<br /><br />Another one my girlfriend bought me is the Original Bushmills in the 400th Anniversary container, was fairly cheap in Dunnes Stores at a price of 16.99euro I think, it was on special.<br /><br />My collection of Whiskey's is looking healthier now and can't wait to put a Greenspot up there. It's going to be scary opening these fella's... if I ever have the cojone's to do so.<br /><br />Edit: As a reminder, the Bushmills I got isn't 1608, 400th Anniversary bottle with the cool case with the silky looking inlay... unfortunately.<br /><br />Update: My girlfriend went out of her way today to buy me the standard Jameson but she went everywhere to try and find one with a box. Fair play to her <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.</div>

				<div class="content">I have two sealed (still in original plastic covering) boxed bottles of Jameson Grace Extra Smooth Irish Whiskey if anybody knows how much they are worth or would like to buy them off me. The boxes were found in my Grandparents house with a note saying they are a shaped bottle, although they boxes are unopened so I can't confirm that.  They are 200ml bottles, at 40%.<br />Thank you</div>
