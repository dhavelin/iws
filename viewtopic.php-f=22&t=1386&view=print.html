				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I don't understand some cask numbers! can somebody help <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> <br />I am wondering about following:<br /><br />1. What dose a cask number declare?<br /><br />2. are they continuously?<br /><br />3. The new  CWS Midleton 1994 SC has the nr 74060 (2011)<br />    The last  CWS Midleton 1996 SC has the nr 71578 (2010)<br />    The new    T2  Midleton 1991 SC has the nr 49120 (2011)<br />    The last     T2 Midleton 1991 SC has the nr 48710 (2011)<br />     and the     T2 Midleton 1991 SC has the nr 48709 (2010)<br /><br />4. Why has the cask from 1994 (74060) a higher cask nr then 1996 (71578) has? <br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Matt, not fully unto speed with the Midleton cask numbering system, but for the purpose of discussion, I will assume they start with cask 1 each year and go from there. The single cask series represents a specially selected cask of outstanding quality from one of many warehouses.

The fact that the DAA numbers are consecutive just means they were filled during the same run or batch.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">PS didn't realise the DAA had two consecutive casks in 2010/2011, missed the 48710 which I presume is now sold out, I wish they would tell us  <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />Assumed the one coming out/just out was the second release, not the third,<br /><br />Does this mean a continuous release of DAA Midletons as they sell out each cask?<br /><br />I'd love to know</div>

That makes sense. I just had the feeling, that this destillat filled into this cask`s is not from a standard run.<br /><br />I know that the cask 48709 is sold out. I bought my 48710 in Nov. the bottles selling had numbers around 60.<br /><br />I don`t think that they will have the new cask untill Jan 2012.(ore the wait untill the 48710 is sold out)<br /><br />It is a pity that all the cask from T2 are distilled in 1991. Only the strenght varies from bottling to bottling.Why not take a 90s ore a 92 <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> <br /><br />Cheers<br />Matt</div>

				<div class="content">Just to confuse things the 1994, that's 74060 is a SECOND fill cask, whereas the others are FIRST fill casks. So it's original use would have been even earlier still.</div>

So if it is reused the old number is scrapped and a new one is put on, no matter what numbering system a distillery uses. In the olden days this was done by stenciling but more common now is bar coding systems.</div>
