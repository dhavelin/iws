				<div class="content">Was in Aldi the other day and spotted a stray bottle of their Glen Marnoch 24 year old from last Christmas. <br /><br />I passed it up then as there was not many great comments about it but on review there are some ok reviews.<br /><br />A lot saying very drinkable, will not blow your mind but worth the money so I decided to nab it.<br /><br />And at €40 it is hard to pass up especially they way Irish whiskey prices have gone this last few years  <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" /> <br /><br />Will give a basic review when I get around to opening it.</div>

				<div class="content">I got a case of Caskmates for future tastings just in case they disappear. I'm hoping to have a bottle for myself too. I also got some Redbreast from the 70's and some Hewitts. These will work well with future tasting too. I'm going to try get some more Paddy and Powers now. The futures bright, the futures Amber.</div>

Sounds a lot all right but just going by price it is possibly comming through AnPost (registered).  I'm happy to pay it at the same time though.<br /><br />I actually haven't been this excited about recieving a bottle of Irish Whiskey since I discovered the original Redbreast 15yo being sold in La maison Du Whisky.</div>
