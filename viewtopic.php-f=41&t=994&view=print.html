				<div class="content">The distillery closed in the 1950s and made very nice pot still whiskey. I take it, since your bottle was bought in the 1970s, it's not the Old Comber 30. There's a few Old Comber 7 yr olds floating about and they're really nice - well worth opening. They also have a bit of value. <br /><br />Do you have a picture or any other information from the label?</div>

				<div class="content">I knew it had closed but didn't realise it was that long ago. The entire wiki entry  -<br /> <br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Comber Whiskey was an Irish whiskey distilled in Comber, County Down, Northern Ireland. The whiskey was last distilled in 1956. However, some reserves were discovered and bottled in the 1980s as &quot;Old Comber&quot; and some of these bottles occasionally come up for sale.<br />Comber Distilleries was established in 1825. At the time of its closure it was the last pot still in Northern Ireland. The Cooperage Coffee Shop on Killinchy Street in the town occupies the last remaining Comber Distilleries building. The shop contains some of the company's casks.</div></blockquote><br /> <br />( Thanks again John, i'll be having it later - maybe. )</div>
