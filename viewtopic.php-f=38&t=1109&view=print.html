				<div class="content">THIS IS A 15 GALLON STAINLESS STEEL STOCK POT THAT I AM MODIFYING THE POT SO I CAN PROPERLY COMPLETE MY OBCESSION FOR MAKING IRISH STYLE WHISKEY. THERE IS A DRAIN VALVE IN IT AS YOU SEE---THE TOOLS ARE THERE BECAUSE WE ARE REPAIRING OUR HOT WATER HEATER AT THE TIME I TOOK THE PHOTO        <br /> <img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/THE%20IRISH%20WHISKEY%20PROJECT/DSCF0003.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />THE LARGE STAINLESS DISK HAS 4 INCH STAINLESS BOLTS THROUGH IT TO ACT AS LEGS AND LEAVE ROOM I THE BOTTOM FOR SPACE BETWEEN THE BOTTOM WHERE THE HEAT WILL BE APPLIED AND THE GRAINS BEING MASHED.--THE DISK WITH THE BLACK CIRCLE AROUND IT IS STAINLESS MESH.--MISS ROCKY IS MAKING A NYLON GRAIN BAG THAT WILL FIT SNUGLY INTO THE POT WITH THIS DISK AS ITS BASE TO HOLD IT INTO A CYLINDERICAL SHAPE--THIS WILL AVOID GRAINS GETTING INTO THE FINISHED WORT AS IT IS BEING DRAINED OUT OFTHE MASH TUN(POT). <br /><br />  <img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/THE%20IRISH%20WHISKEY%20PROJECT/DSCF0004.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /> i still need  get to tampa for the grain-- ill be back from philadelphia in 2 weeks. possibly i can find thegrain there and save the cost of petrol to tampa--it will cost about $40 us for the tampa trip and then about another $45 us for the grain. i might get a gallon 3.8 liters from that.</div>

The grain bag is for lazy guys like me. i'm trying to eliminate the aggrivation of some grain passing through  but yes a false bottom(sieve of some sort) is what most more experienced mashers use.<br />   Now i need some of your Irish luck so i find a grain supplyer on me trip.<br /><br />Know any leprechauns??? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
