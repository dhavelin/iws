It's so hard to pick anyway - like choosing favorite family members! I do recall Slieve Foy was well liked on its own merits in addition to having a fun personal connection for a member of the group. The Millenium Malt and Palace Bar pours may have been the two with the most hands in the air during our 'vote early and often' poll at the end. Those were the two I voted for, although I probably most appreciated the opportunity to try the two Teelings. I recall reading reviews of them when they were released and wondering if I'd ever have the opportunity to try them. Well done to Pat indeed!</div></blockquote><br /><br />It was quite a pleasure to be joined by such a worthy group of devotees in a long and happy tasting. (Not everyone sampled everything, I hasten to add.) The Teelings were particular favorites, though there was quite a variation in people's preferences. I am happy to report that Seamus was his usual stalwart self, providing plenty of insights!</div>

				<div class="content">Got a bottle of The Sexton Single Malt.  Very interesting.  Comes in a squat, black, six-sided bottle.  Looks like a Bushmills product.  It is aged in sherry casks and that really comes through.  I could see how some people will hate it because of its overt sweetness, but I enjoyed it and its $25 price tag!</div>

As you noted, it's easy-drinking and a great value whiskey.</div>

The good news was that my wife and I had received our travel dates to meet and pick up our new adopted daughters. We are now settling into things at home and pretty dresses and shoes (3 family weddings to attend this year) are a higher priority than my cellar stocking wish list. I expect inventory will be contracting for the next few years!</div>
