Any good female Hungarian singers, for example?</div>

Starting from the Slave field songs and once the African-Negro slaves found Christianity ... Gospel as we know it was born. From gospel and poverty the Blues was born. Jazz and rock branched out from the blues and motown directly from Gospel.<br /><br />I like the idea of a breakaway group though  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
