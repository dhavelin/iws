I know it is great to see but I'm very uncomfortable with these young €200 plus single casks.<br /><br />The notion that these young to midle age IDL whiskes are worth more that some much old scotches irkes me greatly.<br /><br />The only reason they are rare is that IDL makes them rare yet they have probaly millions hectolitres of whiskey maturing in their warehouses ... it's the biggest con goung and it annoys me. And let it be said I don't blame Ally one bit for it either. But I supose it is a start.</div>

I've tried them both together in the last few days and I'd say last year's would be a shade ahead for me too. It's great to try a single cask pps, and it's more in the green spot than redbreast spectrum. I really really like this year's bottling, but I think the grain in last years added a little something extra, a sort of soft vanilla sweetness.<br /><br />It's also interesting in the context of the general assumption that SM, and PPS are far more interesting than blends. It's always been my view that from Midleton and Bushmills this is not always the case.</div>
