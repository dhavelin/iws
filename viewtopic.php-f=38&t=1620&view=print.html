				<div class="content">Was really looking forward to the Euro 2012 campaign and had great (if optimistic) hopes for Ireland until of course last night  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />I think we can book the plane home ....<br /><br />Can't really say they deserved to win but the First Goal was very soft, second Goal stung of off-Side and a bit of a defensive disaster, third goal just finished us off totally. We seemed to have no fight against the Croat's and in all fairness to them they were all over us giving us very little chance to pass it around in the second half, closing down options very well. And after seeing Italy in good form against the mighty Spain I fear for the rest of the group stages. We may end up being the whipping boys which would be very sad ...</div>

				<div class="content">I think it was always optimistic to think we could get a result out of any game .... our best chance is the game against Italy ... Croatia were always underestimated simply because they are not a traditional soccer powerhouse but you don't get to World number 8 by being soft touches ... (Italy are world number 9 by the way)</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry about yesterday's game.  I watched a good chunk of it while sipping a Redbreast 12.  As a very casual soccer fan (though my interest is growing, so there's hope  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ), I was curious about what the Irish supporters were singing during the last 10 minutes of the match.  The play-by-play commentator and the Canadian studio hosts (I was watching on TSN, the Canadian equivalent of ESPN) were suitably impressed by the fan support.  If someone could let me know what the song was (with lyrics, or a link, if possible), I would be very interested to know.  Thanks!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

It's got the power to choke up even someone with no ties to Ireland (other than taking a 3rd year university history class, and having a desire to travel there!).</div>
