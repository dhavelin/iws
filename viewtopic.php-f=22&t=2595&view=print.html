				<div class="content">I am trying to put together a collection of new spirit, that is whisky straight from the still, which cannot be sold under the description whisky / whiskey, and would be interested in acquiring samples from working Irish distilleries. Any help would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Perhaps, surprisingly, the samples that I have already acquired from a number of distilleries are quite distinctive. Obviously, wood and age have a major impact on nose and mouth but in most cases the basic characteristics can still be easily detected.</div>

				<div class="content">The spirit from the still should have lots of character. If you do manage to get spirit from certain distillers please don't post their names. <br /><br />I think there maybe issues with excise duty on alcohol and therefore may get some in trouble.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Fyntyn,<br />It would be an unusual whiskey that would reach its peak at 5yo. to be honest. Many entry level offerings come in at the 5 to 7 yo mark. It is more like consumer demand than advertising acumen which has convinced whiskey drinkers that 'aged' whiskey is a better product.<br />Back to the topic in question though; I could be corrected but a number of distilleries have produced commercially available new make spirit samples so with a bit of research you should be able to source some.<br />John.</div>

To my experience Irish whiskeys under 5 are a little to immature. It depends greatly with the cask too. I think between 12-16 is ideal for Irish. They are lovely younger too but I think 6+ is better.<br /><br />I've tasted the Pogue whiskey from West Cork Distillers and its 3 years old. It's not great but is very well marketed and will sell. <br /><br />I believe lots of Bourbons I've  had are great at 5-8 years old and there are some good ones even younger too.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it may be more of a taste thing, some like their whiskey old others young.<br /><br />Italy was such a place where young whiskey was a big hit. Bushmills used to have a 5yo on sale there as did Glen Grant which was a very big seller. <br /><br />In saying that a 5yo whiskey may have been perceived to be old against the standard blended whiskey of the day.</div>

				<div class="content">Jura produced a very good 4 y.o. a few years ago for the Japanese market. Jack Milroy bottled a delicious 4 y.o. bourbon cask Macallan in the 90s, and Ardbeg bottled a 4 y.o. for Members, also. I still have bottles in my collection. Down to my last Macallan. Wish there was more bourbon cask Macallan about!</div>
