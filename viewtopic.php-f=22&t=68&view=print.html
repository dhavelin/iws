				<div class="content">Yes. Need an education in whisky as apposed to whiskey. Also, tried the Glenglassaugh 19 yo the other day in Brooks, to see what I was letting myself in for, very nice.</div>

If it wasn't for the CWS tastings I'd be completely at sea with the Scottish offerings.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to hearing what The Irishman is up to too. They are certainly beating their own path.</div>

It's not even on their web-site.</div>

				<div class="content">Three is right. The Cask Strength (which I last sampled courtesy of IrishWhiskeyChaser  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) is excellent though, sadly, outside my budget for a bottle of whiskey. I do have a bottle of 70 though, which tides me over.</div>

				<div class="content">Im looking forward to the Glenglassaugh part of the tasting, as i believe were getting to try some old whiskies 21yo and 30 yo, like BrianH i have already sampled the 19 yo.<br />As for the Irishman i looking forward to re-avulating them as my previous tasting of them was a bit rushed</div>
