				<div class="content">I just received this press release:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;Cooley Still Champions of Europe</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Cooley Distillery named European Distiller of the Year for 3rd Consecutive Year</span><br /><br />Cooley Distillery, Ireland’s only independent whiskey distiller, has been named European Distiller of the Year for the third year running at the 2010 International Wine and Spirit Competition Awards banquet in London last night.<br />This latest accolade follows Cooley’s 10 gold medals haul from the IWSC in July of this year which brought its total to 100 gold medals over the last 10 years. This follows on for Cooley’s earlier success of being named 2010 Distillery of the Year by Malt Advocate, the leading whisky magazine in North America. <br /><br />To date Cooley has won the European Distiller of the Year title three times (2008, 2009, 2010), been named World Distiller of the Year by the IWSC (2008) and in 2009 Cooley’s Kilbeggan 15-year-old blended whiskey collected the prestigious Brown Forman Trophy for Worldwide Whiskey of the Year.  <br /><br />Jack Teeling, Managing Director, commented, “To be the best in Europe three years in a row is a fantastic achievement for everyone involved in Cooley Distillery and is an Irish success story we can all be proud of in these challenging times. Our success is based on innovation, a range of world class whiskeys and lot of hard work.”<br /><br />The awards were accepted on the night by Noel Sweeney, Master Blender and Jack Teeling, Managing Director of Cooley Distillery, at the 41st IWSC Awards ceremony at the Guildhall in London.&quot;<br /><br />Well done.<br />Malty</div>

				<div class="content">That's great for Cooley. It really is an excellent distillery, I think. It should get more attention from aficionados. I think if it was Japanese or Scottish, people would give it more attention. Maybe I'm wrong.</div>

The Connemara 12yo is a bit OTT against it's Scottish and Japanese counter parts.<br /><br />Anybody taste the Tyrconnell 18yo yet? I it the same price as the 17yo from last year? Hope so, think I'll get one when I'm up next week.<br /><br />Hearty Congratulations to all at Cooley though a great achievement.</div>
