				<div class="content">Its probably been mentioned before, but I must say that Writer's Tears is very nice whiskey. For €38 per bottle at Celtic Whiskey, it seems good value for what you get. Better neat, or with one cube of ice? Can't make up my mind.</div>

And that was that Irish is totally over powered by a scotch ... untrue, and maybe it is only me, but for me a Laphroaig does not over power a Jameson 12yo or a Powers Gold and any of the PPS whiskies totally stand on their own. <br /><br />So morale of the story just because something is smooth and mellow does not mean it is devoid of taste.</div>

				<div class="content">with only a few nights left in ireland, going to relax tonight with some redbreast 12yo.  this is the quintessential irish whiskey for me.  if someone asked me how to define irish whiskey...this is what i would let them taste.  <br /><br />saw your previous post about laph 10yo IWC.  i couldn't agree with you more.  i dont know what it is about that stuff, but it just conjures up all things good for me.  the stuff blows my mind even more with each new taste.  for me, there really is nothing better than a snowy winters night with a dram of laph 10yo and a turf fire.  i sure am going to miss that.  i guess ill have to settle for some peat incense, lol</div>

				<div class="content">I opened on of the Lagavulin 12yo sherry cask bottles last night. Well worth a visit for any laga fan. Very sherried, obviously, very rich but still plenty smoke at that age. Quite different to the other lagavulins, except maybe the 21yo - it's like a younger more heavily sherried version, but not to the point of drowning out the Laga character.</div>

				<div class="content">Canadians mean something different to Americans when they talk of rye whiskey.<br />There need not be any rye at all in Canadian whiskey, yet they can still call it rye for some reason.<br />CC does have a bit of rye in its 'flavouring whiskey' mashbill, but more corn than anything, I believe. That then gets blended with a light 'base' whiskey, a bit like how we dilute PPS with grain whiskey for Irish blends.</div>

Like all our whiskies 1858 Original is blended before ageing. This allows the subtle flavors of the rye, rye malt, barley and corn to marry perfectly before their long sleep in top quality white oak barrels. The result is a smooth, light, mellow flavor</div>
