				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>Welcome Davin. Our third Malt Maniac on board, I think. Maybe our first Canadian?<br /><br />Maybe you could fill us in on the best Canadian whiskies...</div></blockquote><br />Hi guys,<br /><br />What a warm welcome, thank you. <br /><br />A list of the best Canadians would be quite long and would include among many others:<br /><br />Pretty much anything from Forty Creek.  The Confederation Oak Reserve is the current darling.<br />Wiser's Legacy (a true ace), Wisers 18 year old (amazing clean wood), Wiser's Small Batch (sweet and spicy)<br />Gibson's 18 year old (wood and creaminess). The Gibson's 12 year old is pretty good too.<br />Canadian Club 20 year old and Canadian Club 8 year old Sherry Cask (think wine-finished single malt).  CC 10 is also good if you like flinty rye (I do).<br />Crown Royal Limited Edition, Crown Royal Extra Rare<br />Danfield's 21 year old Small Batch (the new batch is supposed to be even more amazing)<br />Sazerac's Caribou Crossing Single Barrel <br />Century Reserve 21 year old and especially the latest batch of Century Reserve 15 year old (!00% corn and so rich, smooth and elegantly woody)<br />Alberta Premium 25 year old, but that is very difficult to find now.  There is a new, older Alberta Premium on the way which is also supposed to be spectacular.<br /><br />Old time favourites include Lot 40 from the late 90's - tastes like German rye bread, Centennial 15 year old from the 60's - tastes like fresh cut cedar smells, and Bush Pilot's - 100% corn and excellent, though not as much so as it's reputation would have it.<br /><br />Thanks for your interest in Canadian whisky and your very warm welcome to the board.<br /><br />Davin</div>

				<div class="content">I've tried some of the Forty Creek and they were lovely. <br /><br />I think the Society should have a Canadian tasting some time. <br /><br />Here's a link to Davin's website - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.canadianwhisky.org/">http://www.canadianwhisky.org/</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">A fascinating post as I've found the selection of Canadian whisky to be a bit confounding.  Very few reviews available for what is in stock.  The prices are totally different than other imported whiskies to boot.  For example I can get 10 year aged Canadian whisky for around 10 dollars for a fifth (Black Velvet).  An Irish or Scottish whiskey of comparable age is at least double the price.  My sampling includes:<br /><br />Windsor Canadian<br />Rich and Rare<br />Black Velvet<br />Canadian Mist<br /><br />Yeah, bottom shelf I know, but it is safer to start low and work high.  If I recall correctly Windsor Canadian was my favorite as it made a good punch.  Any recommendations for further exploration?</div>

I think any of the Forty Creek Whiskies are well worth the money.  Black Velvet Reserve is another good one.  I like the Canadian Club 10 year old - it's got a lot of rye grain in it, and I like the CC 12 which is very sweet and creamy. Snake River Stampede is a nice one and so is just about anything from Wiser's.<br />But this is an Irish whisky forum.  What are your favourites?<br />Davin</div>
