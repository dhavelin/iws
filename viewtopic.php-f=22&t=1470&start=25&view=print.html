				<div class="content">I couldn't resist scanning a photo from the Sunday Business Post and putting it on the blog:<br />  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.irishwhiskeynotes.com/2012/02/distillery-of-year.html">http://www.irishwhiskeynotes.com/2012/0 ... -year.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It shows Barry Crockett posing with a cask &quot;reserved for 2030&quot;. Obviously they have been thinking about Jameson's 250th anniversary. So, what's your ultimate fantasy limited edition Jameson bottling, suitable for marking such an important anniversary? Money no object! (Start saving now.)</div>

				<div class="content">Can't believe I have not posted here yet ...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />Anyway a 12-15 year old single cask Mod Pot SPS, which basically is quite a heavily sherried whiskey.<br /><br />I think IDL are afraid to do something like this as these single cask can be big brutes and a mile away from their wonderfully blende SPS offerings like Redbreast ... but that is what I'd love  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />I know some here have had a chance to taste from the cask and luckily I have too and these certainly come across as nearly a different style of whiskey that what Jameson or Midleton lovers know.<br /><br />Certainly not an every day whiskey but would be a serious treat every so often.<br /><br />Maybe be they could set up a completely different Brand name for such a project and that might distance it from the Jameson &amp; Midleton brands.</div>

				<div class="content">Why don't the increase the brands.<br />Create a new name to herald their expanding distillery.<br />I know we have Dunphy's on the bottom end and Midleton on the top along with some of the premium Jameson's. But a new mid range Whiskey that could have a more grain element or malt range.<br /> I love the SPS's but having a more diverse range would help get them make more inroads into other markets.</div>
