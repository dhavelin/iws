				<div class="content">In your opinion, what bottles should every whiskey drinker have in their possession as much as possible?  <br /><br />Ease of availability and relative affordability of the bottle should be a consideration.  With those parameters in mind, I would consider the following to be must have bottles:<br /><br />Auchentoshan 12<br />Buffalo Trace or Evan Williams Single Barrel<br />Forty Creek Barrel Select (not sure if this Canadian is available in Europe)<br />George Dickel #12<br />Glenfarclas 15<br />Glengoyne 10<br />Glenmorangie Original<br />Highland Park 18<br />Lagavulin 16<br />Laphroaig Quarter Cask<br />Redbreast 12<br />Talisker 10 and/or Highland Park 12</div>

				<div class="content">Based on what is readily available, i.e. not once-off releases.<br />Yellow Spot 12yo - fantastic whiskey!<br />Powers John's Lane<br />A cask-strength Midleton (any of them will do thanks, but the Society bottling is particularly good)<br />Bushmills 21yo<br />Tyrconnell Single Malt 18yo<br />Aberlour a'bunadh<br />Wisers 18yo Canadian whiskey<br /><br />They'll do for a start! There are many others but availability and price would be an issue in terms of keeping a cabinet stocked on a regular basis!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">A great list Luke!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />   However, many of the listed bottles (i.e. the Tempest, Turf Mor, PJL, Jeffersons PS etc.) that are limited releases and/or simply not available (yet) in North America.  That is why I tried to limit my list to more easily available 'reference' or 'staple' whiskies.  <br /><br />It would definitely seem that I will have to pick up the Yellow Spot when it (hopefully) gets to Ontario (we did receive a batch of Green Spot, which is now down to less than 150 bottles in the province...I've tried it and was not completely sold on it for Can$85 a bottle).</div>

				<div class="content">For my money if I'm including Jameson in my cabinet ( which I do ) it's the Gold Reserve for me. It should be available in Canada, ( it's very available in the USA so check out that option ) and the price shouldn't be too painful as it's widely available over here, you'll never drink 12yr old again if you've had this Of course perhaps you have ?<br />Honeyed sweetness with oak and spice on the nose,<br />Buttery, smooth, sherry wood, fruit cake and madeira. it's lovely.</div>

				<div class="content">It's comforting to know we're not the only ones paying exorbitant prices for whiskey here in NZ. Unfortunately, not only are prices nearly double what they would be we also have a fairly limited selection, hence it's nice to see an emphasis on widely released bottles and not just the rare one-offs that don't get much distribution overseas. <br /><br />Also it's eally good to see recommendations for scotch, since I have less experience knowing what's what there and am keen to branch out. Thanks for all the tips everyone :)<br /><br />As far as Irish whiskey goes, I try to keep some of the following stocked at all times:<br /><br />SPS<br />Green or Yellow Spot, Powers John's lane or Redbreast<br /><br />Single malt<br />Lockes 8, Tyrconnel, Bushmills 10 or Knappogue Castle 12<br /><br />Blend (expensive)<br />Jameson 12yo, Crested Ten, etc.<br /><br />Blend (cheap)<br />Powers, Paddys, Jameson, Kilbeggan, Bushmills black or white, etc.<br /><br />Grain<br />Greenore<br /><br />Aside from Connemara and the like, are there any gapping holes in this list?</div>

				<div class="content">Black Bush and Jameson for day to day drinking. And then regular favourites are:<br /><br />Bushmills 10<br />Jameson Small Batch<br />Redbreast 12<br />Green Spot<br /><br />Looking at that list it is very Irish based, but I do like a lot of Scottish whisky too - Glenfiddich 18, lots of independent bottlings of Clynelish, most Balvenies (excepting the double wood), and Northern Highland whiskies in particular all get consumed! Powers John's Lane is awesome, and would be bought far more frequently but for the cost.</div>

However, with there only (currently) being a $20 difference between the Gold and the Jameson 18 here in Ontario, my next splurge purchase will be a bottle of Jameson 18 as I REALLY enjoyed that when I had a chance to sample it earlier this year (milk chocolate underneath some wonderful tropical fruit notes</div>

				<div class="content">What are peoples thoughts on Writers Tears (Can $47 in Ontario...$10 more than BlackBush and $8 cheaper than Redbreast 12, my two Irish whiskey bottles at the moment).  Any comparative notes and/or comments about value for money about WT would be greatly appreciated!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I think for that price it is well worth a try and is possibly slightly cheaper than over here. It is very drinkable and has this creamy buttery bit going on with it (to me anyway). It is actually hard to track down in my neck of the woods and only for that would probably make it <span style="font-weight: bold">A Whisk(e)y Cabinet MUST include</span> ...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">I totally agree, it's a gem of a whiskey but too hard to find. I really hope the Irishman make it more readily available. <br /><br />I got it in The Wren's about  6 months ago and it has a following now. I'd have it over Green Spot any day, but I also like the ill fated Redbreast blend so hopefully it doesn't go the same way. <br /><br />I bet if the Redbreast blend was out today it'd be successful, any thoughts?</div>
