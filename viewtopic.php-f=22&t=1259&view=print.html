				<div class="content">At the whisky exchange whisky show on Friday IDL unveiled another Jameson, unfortunately all the sampling took is toll on me and i cant remember its name (Jameson Special Reserve??). All i can remember is that it was trialled in South Africa and was made from a &quot;small batch&quot; grain and some sps. It tasted very grainy but not in a bad. But anyone else know the name? I think it is to be priced between the regular and the 12 yo so i dont know what that means for Crested Ten.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>43% is the legal minimum in South Africa, introduced to discourage imports and protect local brandy makers.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I'm not sure that's the reason for 43% being the minimum strength in South Africa.  I think 75 degrees proof/ 43% abv was the minimum in the UK and Ireland until World War II, when it was reduced to 70 degrees proof in the UK and presumably Ireland reduced the legal minimum in line.  (Less barley or other grain would have been needed to make whisk(e)y at 70 degrees proof rather than 75 degrees proof.)  (Relying on Philip Morrice's <span style="font-style: italic">Schweppes Guide to Scotch</span> for this.)  There wouldn't have been a compelling reason to make a similar reduction in South Africa during the war (I doubt there was any rationing.)<br /><br />I have a bottle of KWV 10 year old South African brandy (not bad for brandy) which is 38% abv, so presumably the 43% abv legal minimum only applies to whisk(e)y.  It seems to apply to all the South African whiskies listed in Whisky Bible 2011.</div>

Sometimes rules or laws are introduced for one reason and are used or justified for other ends.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes indeed 43% was pretty much standard for a long time.Prior to that,  Off the top of my head, one of the main standards was 15UP or 15under proof which equated to 70% imperial proof 85% US proof or 42.5% abv. I know all very confusing with the Imperial score. I presume to make life easier they adjusted to 86% proof or 43% abv and Imperial was just dropped altogether. <br /><br />You'll find that alot of the stuff destined for Germany, Italy and the US was all 43% (or 86 proof) up till the 80's.</div>
