				<div class="content">I'm not sure if I'm on a hopeless mission, but I am trying to track down a bottle of whiskey to give to my aging father as a birthday gift.<br /><br />A little history...<br />I was at a bar a few years ago and saw a sign advertising &quot;Egan's No.8 Irish Whiskey&quot;. Being an Egan myself, I thought it would be wonderful to have a piece of my family's heritage so I started looking into it a little but got nowhere. I can barely find any sort of information about the company and absolutely nothing on how to purchase a bottle. In my recent searches, I did run across old labels for John Egan &amp; Sons and I thought it would be a great birthday present to give to my father (ironically named John Egan).<br /><br />Now I'm trying to reach out to others and see if there is anyway to get a hold of a bottle (through an auction or some sort of distributor) of Egan's No.8 Irish Whiskey, Egan's 10 Years Old Whiskey, or anything made/bottled by the Egan Family.<br /><br />Is there anyway that you could point me in the right direction on who I should talk to about how I can acquire what I'm looking for?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help that you can offer me... on behalf of Brad Egan</div>

				<div class="content">Egans of Waterford were local bottlers, personally I have never seen a bottle of this for sale in the last 10 years, however I dod once come across an empty bottle for sale.<br /><br />Unrelated are P.H.Egan of Tullamore who were a much larger concern, who bottled beer, ales, stout and whiskey. As was the custom at the time they would have bottled under the producer name e.g. Guinness, Jameson etc but would the bottlers name in small print.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/215/1/Tullamore-Industry-and-Commerce-P-amp-H-Egan039s/Page1.html">http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/2 ...
