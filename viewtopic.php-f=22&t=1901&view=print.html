				<div class="content">Howdy!<br /><br />I'm going to be leading a vertical tasting of four Jameson expressions (Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve, Jameson 18year-old Master Selection, Jameson Select Reserve and Jameson) along with Redbreast and The Wild Geese Irish Soldiers &amp; Heroes Rare Irish Whiskey. If anyone would like to join us it is happening on March 26 at the Masonic Temple in Montreal (2295 Saint-Marc) tickets are $50 and include a tour of the Masonic Temple before the tasting.<br />More information is here <a href="http://www.whiskymontreal.ca/" class="postlink">http://www.whiskymontreal.ca/</a><br /><br />In the meantime (and the major reason I'm posting here) I have a couple of questions about the bottle of 18 year old that we're going to be tasting:<br />1. There is a line which reads &quot;750ml 43% alc/vol B374 South Africa.&quot; I was wondering what the &quot;B374&quot; meant? <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nevermind, I got the answer for this one, thanks</span></span> <a href="memberlist.php-mode=viewprofile&amp;u=340.html" class="postlink">Good Whiskey Hunting</a> <br />2. On the front of the bottle there is a number &quot;298038&quot; followed by what looks like &quot;jj i8-8&quot; to the right of the &quot;750ml.&quot; What does this number mean? <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nevermind, I got the answer for this one, thanks</span></span> <a href="memberlist.php-mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54.html" class="postlink">Good Whiskey Hunting</a> <br />3. On the back of the bottle under the bar code there is another number &quot;L134131280 09:20&quot; What does this number mean? <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nevermind, I got the answer for this one, thanks</span></span> <a href="memberlist.php-mode=viewprofile&amp;u=340.html" class="postlink">IrishWhiskeyChaser</a> <br />4. On the back of the bottle above the bar code there is something that was crossed out with a black marker by hand (probably due to SAQ regulations) can you tell what was crossed out?<br />5. On the neck of the bottle there is a third code number &quot;JQ-058548&quot; What does this number mean? <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nevermind, I got the answer for this one, thanks</span></span><br />6. Who picks the oak casks? Is it the distiller, blender, whiskey science guy or cooper? <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nevermind, I got the answer for this one, thanks</span></span> <a href="memberlist.php-mode=viewprofile&amp;u=340.html" class="postlink">IrishWhiskeyChaser</a> <br />7. On the bottom of the box there is another number underneath what appears to be a recycling symbol. It is &quot;2007337&quot; What does this number mean? <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nevermind, I got the answer for this one, thanks</span></span> <a href="memberlist.php-mode=viewprofile&amp;u=340.html" class="postlink">Good Whiskey Hunting</a> <br /><br />Thanks tons in advance, and now I will go introduce myself...</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Zeke, Welcome.<br /><br />I'll give some info but hopefully some others can fill in the blanks.<br /><br />1. Sorry I can't shed light here, I know it's on the bottles here too. I believe it's an import declaration form number.  <br /><br />2. The &quot;298038&quot; is the bottle number, the &quot;JJ18&quot; is Jameson 18 and the &quot;-8&quot; is the 8th edition of it.<br />    The first 4 editions were called Jameson Masters selection and had the bottle number with JJ18-1,JJ18-2,JJ18-3 and JJ18-4. I have never seen a JJ18-5,6,or 7. <br /><br />3. The L number is a batch number. mine is L200931002 11:35 the date may be underneath mine has 09.01.12. I know other members have a much better understanding of them.<br /><br />4.I'll post a picture of the back of mine. The rear labels change from country to country so the picture may not help. <br />   The 2 images directly above the barcode are &quot;don't drink when pregnant&quot; and &quot;der Grun Punkt&quot;, a standard recycling symbol. I don't know if these  are international symbols             therefore I'm mentioning them. <br /><br />5. You've found the answer.<br /><br />6. I would think they have a department for this. I think other members can shed more light on this.<br /><br />7. This is a number used by the packaging department. You will see numbers like 20006753 in tiny writing in the bottom left corner of the back label  and 20007236 on the front label. These numbers all aid in the packaging. I would assume they are product codes for the label etc.  Each product line has there own numbers for rear, front neck and box/carton. <br /><br />I hope what I've posted is correct and helpful. Other members will correct any mistake I've made and hopefully fill in the blanks.<br /><br />Best wishes with the tasting.</div>

				<div class="content">Howdy!<br /><br />Thanks tons for your reply. And the picture of the back of your bottle, but here in Quebec (Canada) they wouldn't cross out pictures. Tomorrow, when I (think I will) have my vintage bottle and a bunch more questions about the markings on the bottles and the boxes I will add to the initial list.</div>

				<div class="content">Q1. There is a line which reads &quot;750ml 43% alc/vol B374 South Africa.&quot; I was wondering what the &quot;B374&quot; meant?<br /><br />A1. No idea maybe what Will said<br /><br />Q2. On the front of the bottle there is a number &quot;298038&quot; followed by what looks like &quot;jj i8-8&quot; to the right of the &quot;750ml.&quot; What does this number mean? <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nevermind, I got the answer for this one, thanks</span></span> <a href="memberlist.php-mode=viewprofile&amp;u=340.html" class="postlink">Good Whiskey Hunting</a> <br /><br />A2. As will said, I think though that any further batches may state as JJ 18-8 but am willing to be corrected.<br /><br />Q3. On the back of the bottle under the bar code there is another number &quot;L134131280 09:20&quot; What does this number mean?<br /><br />A3. This is a batch code which can be used when and where it was bottled.<br /><br />Not 100% sure which is which but something like this. ANd it is slightly complicated as usually the L and the first digit is used to gage the year but I have a feeling IDL are using the second 2 digits but cannot confirm. Then there will be a 3 digit batch number a 3 digit Julien date and a 1 or 2 digit line code and finally in some cases the actual time.<br /><br />In your case <br /><br />L1 (2011)<br />341 (Julien Date i.e. the 128th day of the year)<br />312 (Internal Batch Number)<br />80  (Internal line code)<br />09:20 (Time)<br /><br />I may not have this exactly right as it is a long time since I've thought about this but it gives you a general idea and in all fairnes not really important outside of L1 which give you te year which is what most people only want or need. This is a pretty standard across the industry. <br /><br />Q4. On the back of the bottle above the bar code there is something that was crossed out with a black marker by hand (probably due to SAQ regulations) can you tell what was crossed out?<br /><br />A4. Need to see what your talking about? <br /><br />Q5. On the neck of the bottle there is a third code number &quot;JQ-058548&quot; What does this number mean? <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Nevermind, I got the answer for this one, thanks</span></span><br /><br />A5. These are historical Batch numbers and used to change but are now more for show and appear on nearly all Jameson bottlings.<br /><br />Q6. Who picks the oak casks? Is it the distiller, blender, whiskey science guy or cooper?<br /><br />A6. I can't say for sure but<br /><br />In the case of the RVR I'd guess Barry Crocket with input/approval from David Quinn and Billy Leighton as they always work closely together.<br /><br />In the case of the 18yo it is probably a cross collaboration from Barry Crocket (Master Distiller), David Quinn (Master of Science) and Billy Leighton (Master Blender). <br /><br />In the case of the less expensive Jameson Select Reserve it is probably done in the lab and a profile is created and a large amount of casks are then selected in batches. Again probably a close collaboration.<br /><br />Q7. On the bottom of the box there is another number underneath what appears to be a recycling symbol. It is &quot;2007337&quot; What does this number mean?<br /><br />A7. As Will said</div>

				<div class="content">The B374 is a customs declaration form number. I would assume by putting it on the packaging they have been cleared for import.</div>

				<div class="content">Howdy!<br /><br />You guys are awesome!! Thanks tons for the replies. I haven't been able to get my camera and the bottle in the same room yet (it's a long story...) but I hope to be able to do so tomorrow.<br /><br />I'm also going to see if I can't find another box of the 18 year-old. Because while Will's explanation of the &quot;2007337&quot; underneath the recycling symbol makes sense, it's too close to an actual date (iun this case Dec 3, 2007) that it gives me pause.</div>

				<div class="content">I believe they changed the Jameson 18 from Master Selection to Limited Reserve in 2007. Before that the bottles were presented in a tube. I stand to be corrected here. My first time noticing it was late 2008 when I got a bottle and it had limited reserve on it from what I remember.</div>

				<div class="content">Howdy!<br /><br />I was able to look at another box and it appears you are right. I never should have doubted it. Apologies and thanks again. The tasting/presentation is coming together very well thanks to your help.</div>
