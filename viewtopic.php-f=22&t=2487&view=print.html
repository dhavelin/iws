				<div class="content">It's official, Irish whiskey can only be made in Ireland. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/simon-coveney-strengthens-spirit-drinks-regulations-344953.html" class="postlink">Here's</a> an article all about it. <br /><br />None of the papers outlined the specifics but it cover Names, Grains used, Stills used and other regulations. <br /><br />I'm not a fan of those Hybrid Stills and certainly don't regard them as Pot Stills but they don't differentiate this well enough in my opinion. <br />Another thing is the use of Beet in Poitín. There was talk of whey being used too. Beet was vertically unknown before the foundation of the State. It certainly would not be a traditional ingredients in Poitín. The use of potatoes was not common either. I wish this wasn't included but it's there.</div>
