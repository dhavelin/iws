				<div class="content">The Thanks a million bottles are going for £200 or so at auctions. They went for more initially but as more arrived the price dropped. <br /><br />The Enda Kenny has yet to go to auction or even retail. I'm guessing €300+ about the same as original single cask from Midleton. <br /><br />The distillers bottle are harder to judge. I'm not sure how many were made. They are 500ml bottles too I think. I know one went for auction a couple of years ago but don't recall the result. It was good.<br /><br />I think I posted it on the &quot;Auction Watch&quot; section of the forum at the time.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for your reply.<br />There are only 500 of the housewarming bottle and most people in the distillery that have them said they would want at least €600 but realistically I'd say €450-€500<br />I might even consider selling them if I got the right offer.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Lois,<br /><br />A picture would be much easier for us to decipher.<br /><br />Alot of these bottles were very similar over a long period.<br /><br />Is it just a bottle or is it still filled? Does it have a label etc.</div>
