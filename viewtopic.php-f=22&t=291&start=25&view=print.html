I only bump up €11 (or 1/2 bottle of Kilbeggan) for Writers Tears but you have to fork out an massive €27 or another 2 bottles of Kilbeggan. <br /><br />I firmly believe that the cost to value ratio affects alot of peoples taste buds and as such you may taste the Writers Tears differently to us on the auld green isle ... not taste wise obviously but value wise i.e. is it worth the extra 2 bottles of Kilbeggan. But I shall not try to influence you taste buds too  much as you've got a free sample  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  but your in for a treat  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the answers and I look forward to trying this one later today.<br /><br />The one unanswered question is about where to place it in my tasting notes; Is it really from &quot;The (Hot) Irishman&quot;? and can I put it with the 10y Irishman which I recently tried?<br /><br />As for price, this sample came to a local shop, the owner of which doesn't drink whisky although he sells some, so he gave me the sample. Apparently, it looks like the German importer, or at least a wholesaler found his website and sent a sample hoping to attract some business. After a quick goooogle I found that most people sell it here for  €39 or €39.99 and if he were to decide to stock it, he would sell it for about the same. His decision will be based upon my recommendation.<br /><br />Malty</div>

				<div class="content">I have just tried this one and although my notes are not yet on my website, I posted quick notes on twitter as I sampled it.<br /><br />Basically:<br />Glass; Classic Malt<br />Colour; Rich yellow gold<br />Nose; Soft, gentle, aromatic, sligthly perfumed heather-coated Irish countryside. There's also some malt with possibly just a hint of lavendar.<br />Palate; Initially very smooth followed by a little tingle (pepper) across the palate. Aromatic and floral malt with a hint of lemon right at the end.<br />Finish; Quite long with a faint hint of lemon<br /><br />Overall Impression; Very nice. A quite typical Irish caress with a lemon twist at the end!</div>

				<div class="content">I think Writers Tears, for me, is a decent whiskey that's worth buying. Not as good as Powers. Maybe if the tinkered around with it a little bit they could make it even better. <br /><br />Personally, I don't like the name, but that's neither here nor there.</div>

When cold the malt is more evident and even a touch of saltiness ??? once it warms up it is much softer and sorry to say it again buttery  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  That's just me though  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">Writers Tears does come from the same company as The Irishman, and like The Irishman 70, is a blend of pure potstill and single malt whiskeys. <br /><br />The spiciness mentioned (pepperiness?) is driven by the potstill whiskey in the blend. In fact the potstill pecentage is a little higher for Writers Tears than The Irishman.</div>
