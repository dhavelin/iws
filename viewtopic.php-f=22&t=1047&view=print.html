				<div class="content">We tried the latest 15yo bottling at a recent IWS tasting. General consensus (myself included) was that it doesn't come close to the first bottling. I haven't tried it side-by-side with the 12yo but it's quite plausible I'd choose the 12yo too.</div>

				<div class="content">Redbreast 12 is also my favourite whiskey. I bought a bottle of the 15 y o on Sunday and have twice sampled it. I actually agree that the 12 is a better tasting whiskey, the 15 has a bigger taste undoubtedly but lacks the subtetly of the 12 and there is some thing going on with the finish that reminds me of socks! <br />I will be returning to the 12 after this.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree ... I've tasted both side by side a few times now and lean towards the 12yr old all the time, generally a nicer wwhiskey in my opinion.<br /><br />I gave a friend of mine the same tasting a few days ago and he agreed, the 12yr was his favourite too.<br /><br />I've never tasted the original 15yr old so can't comment on how the new compares to the old.<br /><br />I can see why they've awarded the Irish Whiskey of the Year to Redbreast 12, it is certainly a very tasty dram.</div>

				<div class="content">The latest batch of Redbreast 12yo (2010) is possibly the best batch to come out in a long time while the 15yo is not a patch on the original so I can see why the 12yo has won. However what I notice about the 15yo is that it seems to have that older pot still style which is an acquired taste and may not be for everybody. To me the new 15yo is like a different whiskey and quite interesting. <br /><br />Great to see the RB12yo getting the award though and well deserved.</div>

				<div class="content">On a value for money basis, there is no contest whatsoever.<br />The fact that there is debate about which is better demonstrates that the 15 year old is simply not worth it's sell price.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Matt,<br /><br />Well spotted, not many people would notice the different address on a label which is only just now being phased out.<br /><br />The bottle you have spotted was the first version of the relaunched brand in the mid/late 1990s after Irish Distillers purchased the brand from Gilbeys.<br /><br />The current (now former) Redbreast 12 year old had the following produced by/for tagline:<br /><br /><br />Fitzgerald &amp; Co.             (from relaunch in mid 1990s - to c. 2000)<br /><br />Edward Dillon &amp; Co Ltd    (c. 2000 - c.2004)<br /><br />Irish Distillers Ltd            (c. 2005 - 2010) <br /><br />Irish Distillers Ltd - new label   (April 2011) <br /><br />Where are you based? I'd like to add a bottle to my collection even though value wise it is much the same as today's bottling.<br /><br />Regards TWB</div>

The Redbreast has had a change of livery since so it is now seen as more collectable since this time last year.<br /><br />I still think that is not a true value ... lets wait and see how the next few do as you will be sure after that one a few more will pop up.<br /><br />Just to give you an idea ... about five years ago I sold on a few Redbreast Blends. The original retail price I bought it at was €24.50. I bought a few and sold the first one for just over €80 the next 2 I sold for €45 &amp; €40 and the last one €29 over the space of about 3 months. This happens regularly with Irish Whiskey and it only takes a few bottles to realise the true market value.<br /><br />Now anybody want my last Redbreast Blend I have one for €100    <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>
