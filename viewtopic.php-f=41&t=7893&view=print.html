				<div class="content">Hello everybody,<br /><br />Based in NL I really enjoy new and old Irish whiskey's.<br /><br />For our Dutch Whisky Club Magazine I'm writing an article on Bow Street Distillery including tasting notes of some old John Jameson.<br /><br />So I got this John Jameson 10yo Egan bottling (probably from the 1930's-1940's), which I'm gonna taste for the article. One thing that strikes me is that the bottom of the bottle states 'Cork Distilleries Co'! The shape of the bottle is definitely the same of Paddy's 10yo from the same era. See images below.<br /><br />The only reason I can think of is that Egan ran out of Bow Street bottles and used a (new or second-hand?) occasional CDC bottle for filling instead. I always learnt that Bow Street Distillery only made use of carefully selected wine merchants for selling their whiskey. They probably would not have approved their whiskey filled in a bottle of one of their biggest competitors <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I was wondering, if any of you have ever seen this before. Is this a rare exception or was it common in the old days to mix up bottles from other distilleries with each other?<br /><br />Happy to hear!<br /><br />Martin</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Martin,<br /><br />Common at the time. Nobody passed any heed.Nowadays it is a case if<br />you are getting a pint in a pub then the barman has to serve Murphy,s in a<br />Murphy' s glass etc. At that time it was the measurement that was important <br />not the bottle as everything was recycled back into use! Enjoy the tasting!</div>

				<div class="content">I'd like to hear you thoughts on the Jameson 10 year old. It's a lovely rich colour. <br /><br />As Raven says it's not unusual to use others bottles. The marketing industry didn't have as much influence at the time.</div>
