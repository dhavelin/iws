				<div class="content">I don't think it 50/60 if it has 70°proof. Do you have a photo of it?<br /><br />I'm guessing it's probably 70's, here's a link to one that sold recently. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/lot/015376/redbreast-12-year-old-196070s">https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/lot/01 ... ld-196070s</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If that's the bottle then your looking at over €300 depending on condition. <br /><br />If that's not the one have a look at this page and it should be one of those. <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1638341516404632&amp;id=1563637963874988&amp;refid=17&amp;_ft_=top_level_post_id.1638341516404632%3Atl_objid.1638341516404632&amp;__tn__=C">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_ ... 2&amp;__tn__=C</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">I can't upload pictures at the moment too. iPhone pictures come out to big. <br /><br />In mint condition they sell at auctions for €300-400. Irish auctions are not as good so you should try a specialist one. You will have to take commission, handling charges &amp; postage to the auction. That could amount to €60+ depending on what auction you choose. <br /><br />Hopefully you can sell it here. Whiskey shops may offer to buy but you won't get near that.</div>
