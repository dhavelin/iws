I'm trying to be good and get my open bottles down to 29 before opening another...but this one is really calling to me!</div></blockquote><br /><br />Ok...so desire won out over lower open bottle count.  I have only closed off one bottle, with another on death's door, so my open bottle count is still in the 30's.  Last night, my neighbour and I 'pre-celebrated' our birthdays by cracking open the Yamazaki 18 and the Sonnalta PX, along with pouring some Talisker 18 to end the evening (that bottle has been open almost five months now).<br /><br />The Yama was excellent with notes of plum, grape, raisin, some floral notes, and what we thought was some vanilla and cinnamon.  I will have to find out how this whisky is aged as it is a unique profile to what I have previously had.  The Sonnalta PX had loads of fruit, as expected, but we both picked up a strong note of overripe banana peel on the nose that I found to be an off note.  My friend really enjoyed it.  I'm hoping the sweet banana that I tasted on the palate wins out over the ripe peel.</div>

After some google digging for a Yama 18 review that actually gave some maturation details, I found this particularly excellent write-up at 'Whisky For Everyone': <a href="http://whiskyforeveryone.blogspot.ca/2010/03/have-just-tried-yamazaki-18-years-old.html" class="postlink">http://whiskyforeveryone.blogspot.ca/2010/03/have-just-tried-yamazaki-18-years-old.html</a>.<br /><br />It turns out that my thoughts (this whiskey seemed to have both bourbon and sherry cask characteristics to my palate-in-training) and yours (go Mizunara Oak go!!) are all included in the final product.  Very interesting (and quite enjoyable on Saturday).  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

To get almost back to the original topic for this thread, my next whiskey purchase will likely be a bottle of Jameson 18 (I believe that the LCBO stock is marked as the 'Master Selection', though my understanding is that, whatever the wording of the label ('Limited Reserve' may have been a previous variation of the 18 yo labelling), the content  of the bottle has not varied.<br /><br />I tried some in May at a bar, and really picked up a citrus (tart) and tropical (sweeter) fruit profile with some chocolate in the background that was really enjoyable.

Fortunately, through hard learned lessons, I called ahead to the store to find out that the one bottle showing at the location I was going to go to, did not exist.  Other than to advise that the J18 is on re-order, they could not give me a timeline as to when it might next show up.  <br /><br />Instead, I decided to pick up a Signatory Vintage (UnChillFiltered Collection) Clynelish 18 yo, 46%, distilled in 1992, which was on very low inventory.  A local pub had purchased a bottle of this in the spring for one of their monthly whisky tastings and I sampled it on two occasions to discover the 'waxy' note that seems to be the signature of Clynelish.  I really enjoyed it, and have been looking to add this bottle since then.  Since this bottle is cheaper than the Jameson 18, the savings (plus some existing savings) still puts me about 1/2 way towards the purchase of the J18 whenever it does come back to the LCBO.  It will almost certainly be my next purchase, likely before the end of November.</div>

It basically is quite different while staying true to the Powers style. Possibly heavier potstill being used or a bigger pot still ratio. <br /><br />Others might have a better or clearer explanation as I've totally forgotten how it was originally explained to me  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>

Is the JL a cask strength version of the regular (a la 'Toshan Valinch vs. Classic)? Thanks in advance for satisfying my curiousity! <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div></blockquote><br /><br />It's bottled at 46% but I don't think it is just a case of extra abv ... it has a more robust pot still character than the normal Powers would have. It basically is quite different while staying true to the Powers style. Possibly heavier potstill being used or a bigger pot still ratio. <br /><br />Others might have a better or clearer explanation as I've totally forgotten how it was originally explained to me <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div></blockquote><br /><br />It's all the robustness of Powers refined without any of the continuous still portion and let age for another 4/5 years, to my knowledge. Whatever they done they done good! <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /><br /><br />My latest purchase was a few bottles of Tyrconnell 5 star I found  lurking in a little place near me at the bargain price of €27 each. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  That's €5 cheaper than the current bottling. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Needless to say, I emptied their stocks.</div>

				<div class="content">From what I remember the Powers NAS is about 75-80% pot still and the rest grain, average age 7-8 yrs, almost all bourbon cask (maybe a small element of refill sherry?), and bottled ad 40%.<br /><br />The regular Powers 12yo is supposedly similar but older.<br /><br />The Powers JL 12yo is 100% pot still with a greater sherry influence and of course 46% and Nonchillfiltered. It seems to me theres a small element of 1st fill sherry but that's just a guess.</div>

Dooohhh<br /><br />And your right about a touch of sherry Iain. It did not even dawn on me to read the back of the box ... my brain is obviously on a different planet these days.<br /><br />I think I need a holiday  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>

				<div class="content">Finally found another Yellow Spot in Foxes on College Green at a slight premium of 67.50. None on display so guessing the end of their stock also.<br /><br />Spotted a few bottles in McCambridges in Galway but was very dismayed to see they had priced it at €99  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /></div>
