				<div class="content">Hi all, I was reading some of the posts about redbreast 10 year old whiskey and was wondering about my 12 year old bottle of redbreast whiskey, the lable is damaged but you can clearly read &quot;Redbreast Rare Old Irish Whiskey&quot; and there is a screw cap and not a cork which is still sealed. I will look forward to your replies, thanks Connell</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Connell welcome to the forum,<br /><br />A picture would be helpful, however in general a damaged label would seriously detract from the collectable value of your bottle.<br /><br />It may only be worth what someone would pay for the contents</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Connell,<br /><br />It is probably worth opening and experiencing an old style pot still, in this case almost certainly from the Old Bow Street Distillery<br /><br />This bottle will contain whiskies a lot older than 12 years which you and your dad will enjoy...<br /><br />This is because Gilbey's stocks started to dry up and the had to use older existing stocks in their RB12, later bottlings grew quite tired.<br /><br />Anyway if you enjoy whiskey drop in from time to time...<br /><br /><br />Cheers TWB</div>

I would think it worth trying but also tempting would be to sell it and buy a few bottles of Redbreast 15 with the proceeds - you might get 3 or 4 very good bottles in exchange for one.</div>

It is now rarely to find like that so tasting it is much worthy than selling the old whiskey.</div>
