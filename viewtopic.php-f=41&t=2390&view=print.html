				<div class="content">I recently acquired a vintage bottle of Jamesons. It was part of an estate sale from an old diplomat family, who kept meticulous logs of bottles gifted to them. These logs led the person who sold this bottle to think it was a 1919 bottling, which is what he claimed. Im not so certain, and havent found a way to precisely place the date. Does anyone have any advice on pinning down the year? There is a serial number on the label, dont know if that can be of help. Any insight would be appreciated! Heres some pics..</div>

				<div class="content">Hey, firstly thanks,Good Whisky Hunting for getting those pics up! And no, i cant currently post the monarch reference, because its covered with a tag labeling who it originally came from. Its a US senator, cant quite read the name and im truing to puzzle it out so dont want to try and remove it just yet.<br />  What i do know is judging by the bottle manufacturer, and the lack of government warning stamped into the glass, it is almost definitely between 1913 and 1933. <br />  Is there any way to research it by the serial number on the bottle?</div>
