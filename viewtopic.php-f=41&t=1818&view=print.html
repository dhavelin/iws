				<div class="content">Dear Whiskey Friends,<br />for a weekend of computer work a friend (Janitor in a retirement facility) gave me a very old Bottle which should be very rare (he got it as a gift from an old women at the work). At least my previous researches hint to it.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Since I’m no expert I don’t exactly know how to handle it now. Where could I sell it best? What do you think of it?</span><br /><br />Further Information:<br />Should be bottled in the 60s and the Label “Alleinauslieferung für WEST-Deutschland” points to a limited Edition only for West-Germany. I have also written to Christine McCafferty  (Archive Manager of Diageo) who replied:<br /><br />“<br /><span style="color: #0000FF">Hi Alexander,<br />Thanks for the message.<br />I have to tell you that I haven’t seen a Bushmills decanter like this one before.<br />From the design of the standard Bushmills bottle that appears on the side of the carton and the booklet, I would date this pack from the early 1980s (maybe the late 1970s).<br />I’m guessing this pack is quite rare as I haven’t seen one before.<br />Unfortunately, we can’t give out valuations but you could try <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bonhams.com">http://www.bonhams.com</a><!-- m --> (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:martin.green@bonhams.com">martin.green@bonhams.com</a><!-- e -->) and/or <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mctears.co.uk">http://www.mctears.co.uk</a><!-- m --> (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:stephen@mctears.co.uk">stephen@mctears.co.uk</a><!-- e -->) for some advice on this.<br />If you are ever thinking of parting with this pack, please let me know as it might be of interest to us for out own collection.<br />Thanks again for sharing this with us.<br />Best wishes,<br />Christine</span><br />“<br />Bushmill Archivist Alma Cambell gave me following information so far:<br />“<br /><span style="color: #0000BF">I had a look at the photos and Its my belief this would have been bottled during the 1960’s.     I started Bushmills in 1972 in the packaging department.   <br />I clearly remember seeing the brochure, which was in several languages <br /> Some of our old gift cartons had the pictures of the riding scene on them  <br />The Irish Coffee glass with the gold round the edge was being used when I first started but we took the gold off the top edge as it was too expensive at a later date.<br />We had historical  label books with some of the old labels being the same shape as shown in the pictures. (These  were sent to Diageo archives department at Menstrie when we became part of them some years ago).   There is a person in charge of the Bushmills archives section there, Ill try and get their name for you.<br />Anor source would be a book called “Spirit of the Age” by the journalist Alf McCreary and there were some pics of some of the old labels in it.   I have a copy at home and ill look at it tonight and get back to you tomorrow if I have any more info.<br />Regards<br />alma</span><br />“<br />All other pieces of info or advices would also be nice. <br />I would be very grateful. <br />Yours sincerely<br />Alexander Scheffler</div>

				<div class="content">I have one of these too, but not in this original packaging. It's 9 yr old whiskey. I think Bushmills generally did the 9 yr old stuff in the 1960s and 1970s. Can anyone confirm this?</div>

				<div class="content">What is interesting is the bottle is 9yo but the picture on the box says 8yo. No big deal in my eyes just an observation.<br /><br />Definitely worth a couple hundred but how much more I really could not say. Very nice though.<br /><br />My advice is put it in whiskyauction.com. Around 20% fees but it gets very good possibly the best prices for Irish.</div>
