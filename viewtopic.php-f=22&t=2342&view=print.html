				<div class="content">Barnard visited 28 Irish Distilleries in 1886 but it easily could have been 29. Founded in 1873, the Banagher Distillery had been mothballed in 1881 and re-opened just a year after Barnard would pass within 5 miles as he visited the Birr Distillery. Had he been inclined to, he would have found Banagher still well-equipped and ready to begin production at the drop of the proverbial hat. But closed or Distilleries under construction were not his interest at the time.<br />What should have been a grand enterprise, Banagher never seemed to find its feet. Started in a large former mill in the town of the same name and right on the banks of the River Shannon, production at first was quick and bountiful. With plenty of water and transportation options nearby, the future should have been bright. But, trouble was present from the start. Money issues would plague the early days as the initial call for investment asked for too little money in too large of shares to attract the adequate capital. London investors initially backing the Distillery presented the opportunity poorly as a result of not having a full grasp of the distilling business. Money would run out and Barnard would barely pass by before the 1887 restart would offer a glimpse of hope. By this time the Distillery's reputation had begun to suffer. Finding a reference in an old Ridley &amp; Co. Monthly, an 1876 distillation sampled in 1884 was literally described as &quot;very common and nasty&quot;.<br />Even with new investment, money and cost of business coupled with lagging sales was the bane of this establishment. A last run at investment was made in 1897 but with a poorly constructed prospectus, little interest was generated and the Distillery closed for good in 1899 and it's three post stills of 22,000 gallons, 11,000 gallons and 9,100 gallons fell silent for good. A comment I found in the Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art (Feb.1897) reads concerning the &quot;well known&quot; Banagher: &quot;Samples of the whiskey of different years' distillations,&quot; we are informed by the prospectus, &quot;can be SEEN at any of the Company's offices.&quot; This is the first time we have heard of whiskey being sampled by looking at it, and we hardly think there will be much run upon the Company's office for testing it under such conditions.<br />The amazing section view of Banagher (12&quot;x18&quot;) accompanying this post is from the 1877 Encyclopaedia of Chemistry, Vol.I which includes a fantastic walkthrough and description of Banagher's operations. Very likely the best and nearly only serious recollection of the facility. I'm not sure Barnard could have added anything else to what is collected in that book.</div>

				<div class="content">'Can be seen' I believe is just a figure of speech and that it would be sampled then as now --- not<br />much would  have changed there. Local history societies are a feature of an awful lot of towns <br />now in rural Ireland and you would be surprised how much you could help each other in this research<br />as they may have a lot of anecdotal stuff on those distilleries. Never dismiss the oral tradition<br />which if consulted would probably even give you the names of families who worked there.</div>

				<div class="content">I am posting a cleaner image of the Banagher distillery plans in a previous post and a detail drawing of the Wash Still from 1877 Encyclopaedia of Chemistry, Vol.I ( American edition)  . There are 2 excellent pages of description of the distillery .Describing it as the largest whisky distillery as yet been erected. Equipment by F. Pontifex of Kings Cross London.  Unfortunately I cannot upload PDF pages and when scanned to the max size for upload ,they are impossible to read.</div>
