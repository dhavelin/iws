				<div class="content">once again, i've been away from the forum/ the bottle for a little while as a result of school pressures but, as the year winds down, i had a chance to read the whiskeynotes blog on the new SPS (still getting used to saying that) bottlings. From what i read, the powers stuff is a 12 year old SPS aged in bourbon barrels with some sherry barrel influence, which sounds like a second cousin to redbreast 12. Aside from the fact that the powers is non-chill filtered, is it just the proportion between the two barrel types that makes them different or are they using their heavier pot still style or what's the story? Powers has always been my stock student-blend and i'm curious to know what you guys thought of the new stuff (as well as the barry crocket midleton). <br /><br />P.S. I'm sorry that i wont be in dublin in time for the Rye tasting or i'd be happy to ferry over some harder to get american stuff (i've managed to get my hands on some Old Potrero and Templeton.) I'll be staying in dublin long term starting in December so if you need any specific american spirit for any future events, just let me know beforehand (i have a good relationship with some of the west coast micro-distilleries like anchor, mccarthy's, charbay, etc)</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Fion치n, true Powers SPS may be a second cousin from the Redbreast but it is once removed  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />To be honest they are very different whiskeys. You are obviously aware of the taste profile of the Redbreast 12yo at this stage. The Redbreast gets a significant amount of it's character from the Sherry cask content. The make up of the Redbreast 12yo is 70% bourbon cask and 30% Sherry cask and that 30% adds a whole pile of sherry charachter. However the Powers John's Lane SPS is over 90% bourbon barrelwith a small amount of sherry cask which is in single ration figures. Even more interesting it uses a much heavier pot still style which gives it a much more robust style with the spice and wood being quite prominent. ANd it produces a wonderfully beefier whiskey in comparison to the others and even the Regular Powers. As Heidi Donnelan mentioned it was very much a masculine whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">thanks Adrian! out of curiosity, is this 90/10 bourbon/sherry treatment and heavier pot still style in any way related to the pot still content in powers blends or is it an entirely separate project?</div>

I got the impression that there was a very small amount of sherry in it and could be under 5% to round off any edges but don't quote me on that. Also the main body of Powers probably comes from the second fill heavy pot still while the subtle flavours come from the first fill bourbon which would be regular mod pot. I would imagine there is a fair amount of the heavy going by taste but have no numbers. <br /><br />I wouldn't I had a long but general chat with one of the guys that would know exactly what is in it but I forgot to ask.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>

If you want it delivered just drop them a mail or give them a bell.</div>
