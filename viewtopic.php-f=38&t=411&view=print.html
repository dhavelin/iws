				<div class="content">Is everyone in Ireland suddenly drinking rum? I notice that Captain Morgan Ireland has over 28,000 fans on Facebook. What's the deal? Is a rum and Coke the fashionable drink in the nightclubs now? If so that's a massive fail for the whiskey industry here. Maybe they need a pic of John Jameson in an eye-patch on the bottles.</div>

				<div class="content">ive been noticing a lot more captain morgan's in the off licenses.....  always though of a captain and coke as a bit of a &quot;college&quot; drink.  but most people flock to whatever is popular.  im the opposite, haha</div>

				<div class="content">The numbers sound incredible in one way but Brettie may have hit the nail on the head. A collecge drink to me sounds like it's a cheaper option than most others and therefore you'll have a raft of people buying this to get their kicks.<br /><br />I would imagine that not a lot of these drinkers go on to become Rum aficionado's  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />So the same would apply to Jameson mixed even though that is how they are conquering America.</div>

				<div class="content">i have it in the states last year, they were mad for it,<br /><br /> i thing it is terrible, but as you say, it is cheap and a &quot;fashion&quot; drink like used to be vodka-orange, jimbeam-coke, and so on, and i am sure a few years later a new mix take over captain-coke</div>

				<div class="content">was in a garage in tuam today and noticed 250ml cans of ready to drink cap'n morgan and cola.  also saw gordons gin and tonic and a smirnoff (i think cranberry) and vodka.  i think these may be taking over for the alcopops.  or at least substituting for the time being.  its a good idea i guess, if you like mixed drinks.  its probably a lot cheaper to buy and mix your own though...but the point is convenience.  cant see these selling in pubs though.  why not opt for the real thing?</div>
