				<div class="content">I suppose it can be called Jameson but not Irish whiskey, as it was not matured in Ireland. That makes it even more interesting.</div>

				<div class="content">Well the incomming whiskey was made produced distilled and matured in Ireland for between 3 - 7 years in Burbon&amp;sherry casks,but due to a mishap with the transport vats they decided to slavage the whiskey by placing it in Spanish oak barrels for nine years,so it is Irish ,but more of a fusion or hybred a real &quot;whiskey geese&quot; expression.<br />None have or will go on general sale or duty free sales,the resulting bottles were distributed to staff,friends etc..i was luck to get a bottle.<br />As its for my c ollection i cant give a taste profile but its in a clear bottle and has a rich dark golden amber..will get a photo organized soon,Slain/Adios/Agur...slainte !!</div>

They imported them to scotland at 12 yrs old, but no matter how long they matured after being exported, it could only be called a 12 year old. <br /><br />Look forward to seeing the picture.</div>

				<div class="content">Kaixo Guys,<br />Thanks Adrian for posting the photo..i sent you two photos,the bottle only came with the white one with the story written in Spanish,but i felt it did'nt do justice to the bottle so i got this green one organized,as its not a numbered limited or age statement ie  12yr etc or vintage ie dated by year,i felt it only acurrate to call it very rare..the vat 9 refers to the 9 years vatted and matured in the Spanish Oak casks from the Navarra wine region.<br />all the best,</div>
