				<div class="content">I'm really excited and thrilled at this latest development...<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.powerswhiskey.ie/powers-casks.html">http://www.powerswhiskey.ie/powers-casks.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Stag's Head &amp; Keoghs in Dublin and Bridies in Kilkenny in a truly innovative departure are now serving Power's from the cask.<br /><br />I have to give a big <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> to IDL for this nod to our past which also shows that the marketing guys can leverage on tradition to produce a win/win situation.<br /><br />Must pop in to the Stag's head to do a Powers head-to-head, straight from the bottle vs straight from the cask (I presume both are at 40%).<br /><br />Certainly a bit of a novelty but not to be dismissed out of hand.<br /><br />I know this is not unheard of in other countries but still to be commended.<br /><br />What does everyone else think?</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>TheWhiskeyBro wrote:</cite>What does everyone else think?</div></blockquote><br />They have had the cask in The Stag's Head for more than a year now. Earlier this year I spoke to the barman about it. It has made a huge difference to sales, serving many times the volume of Powers now compared to before.<br /><br />I tried it (not side-by-side) and didn't notice anything unusual but it could have been just after a refill.<br /><br />Anyway, I think it's a great idea. Raises the profile of Irish whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">Excellent idea and marketing tool ... however if the Casks on the site (which do look animated) are to go by I reckon they are mock ups in the first place. The tap is half way up the barrel  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Probably a container within the cask that just needs refilling every so often. But looks the bizz I like  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
