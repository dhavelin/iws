It's not a case of a in dept tasting survey as many people had not tasted many of the line up but more of a popular vote.<br /><br />But judging by the voting it is highly regarded and justified it's inclusion.<br /><br />I have been trying to get this going for 3 years now so in the end just went for a basic vote and finally got something on the go. We can tighten up on criteria as we go forward.</div>
