				<div class="content">Only having recently became interested / fascinated by Irish Whiskey I have only had the pleasures of trying the latest Greenspot available!<br /><br />However I am led the believe the older bottling from a few years back is far superior and i do like the latest one. I have searched but they seem now pretty non available!!<br /><br />A friend has an older screwcap bottle he has told me and would sell for the right offer but would prefer keep it as is top quality in comparison to newer versions of the beautiful spot.<br /><br />Anyway does anyone know what a good decent offer would be - in my opinion its unavailable and i know will carry a premium but just how much? - any idea on decent fair offer as do not wanna offend him either?<br /><br />All opinions welcome...but oh would i like a dram!</div>

				<div class="content">The old one was a blend, with (I believe) a bit more barley pot still spirit than say powers, but not as much as a pure pot still such as redbreast. <br /><br />In true hipster style, there is nothing better or worse about a blend than a pps, nor of a younger whiskey over an older one. However, blended whiskey is cheaper. And younger whiskey is also cheaper. So the Green Spot before the current one was a cheaper quality whiskey than the redbreast 12 of its era, yet they were both selling for the similar prices.<br /><br />Old green spot was a quirky whiskey, new greenspot is a lighter, fresher version of redbreast 12 (IMO). <br /><br />So in terms of value, if your eccentric collection of late 90s - mid 2000s whiskey collection is incomplete without this bottle, then maybe it is worth €87-100. If you just want a good drinking whiskey, it is worse (IMO) than current GS but more interesting than say ordinary powers 12 and so it is worth maybe €30-50. If you want to do a side by side whiskey geek comparison, it's probably worth somewhere between the two.<br /><br />Or, if you are crazy, you could buy the Greenspot 10 year old PPS from that era for an eye watering €250:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/type/green-yellow-spot/green-spot-whiskey-10-year-old.html#!prettyPhoto">http://mitchellandson.com/spirits/type/ ... rettyPhoto</a><!-- m --><br /><br />As an aside, the fact that all these whiskies are now selling for €50+ is slightly scary. There was a time when they were only a few euro between a standard jameson or black bush and a redbreast 12 (I just looked up an old thread on boards where in Christmas '08 they were selling redbreast 12 for €31.50 - current redbreast 12 is €59 in CWS). Standard blends haven't gone up much and have in some instances gotten cheaper.</div>

Didn't the society do a greenspot tasting night a while ago:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.liquidirish.com/2012/01/green-spot-irish-whiskey.html">http://www.liquidirish.com/2012/01/gree ... iskey.html</a><!-- m --></div>
