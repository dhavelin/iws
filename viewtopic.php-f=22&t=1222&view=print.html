I just brought this up in another post but this might also be a valuable place to mention it as i know education is one of the society's primary goals and wikipedia is a massive space for that. The article on PPS shouldnt even exist in theory as the name's been SPS for some time now but, anyway, the already slim article's been hijacked by editers mistaking it for the theoretical idea of distilling whiskey in a pot still and have deleted any national or mixed mash references. Similarly, the Irish Whiskey article is pretty miserable and uses terms like &quot;pot still blend&quot; for greenspot. If anyone has time to go over there and do some much needed clean-up or even create a new article for Single Pot Still, it'd probably be a nice addition to the overall internet push to educate the world about SPS whiskey</div>

I could be wrong about this.</div></blockquote><br />If you read the usage guides, there is a bias towards following the normal rules of English where possible. So, for example, 'referendums', not 'referenda'.<br /><br />There is no way to get from 'whiskey' to 'whiskies' except by inventing a whole new rule of pluralisation. There is no argument that 'whiskeys' is a correct plural for 'whiskey', whereas 'whiskies' is contentious and likely to annoy. Therefore 'whiskeys'.<br /><br />And while I'm here, can I point out that no English word is spelled with brackets? 'Whisk(e)y' is not a word, and 'whisk(e)ys' is just embarrassingly wrong in all sorts of ways.</div>

				<div class="content">It's even part of my job to read the usage guides all the time. I even write them for different companies. Thinking about it, I know you're right, but there is a lot of irregular usage in English, and, personally, I'd  say this one is of minor importance. That's just my feeling on it. I just wouldn't object if someone spelled it &quot;whiskies&quot;, especially as it works as a general reference to whiskies of the world.</div>

Both &quot;whiskeys&quot; and &quot;whiskies&quot; encompass all varieties of whiskey.<br /><br />I don't object either if someone uses &quot;whiskies&quot;, just if they use both &quot;whiskey&quot; and &quot;whiskies&quot; because that's inconsistent. Both 'whisky' and 'whiskey' are acceptable spellings so it's up to individuals / publications / companies to decide which one they will use whan referring to whiskey in general. But having picked one, at least you should pick the matching plural.<br /><br />The IWS, I believe, having chosen to emphasise the 'e' that is common to all Irish whiskey branding should always use 'whiskeys', unless referring specifically to, say Scottish whiskies, where it is appropriate to adopt the spelling associated with that product.</div>

It saves me from having to type both whiskey and whisky all the time and I for one am not going to change that practice ... especially when it annoys so many of you  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <br /><br />Don't really have an issue with Whiskies either. At the end of the day the English is a living and changing language and the Oxford English Dictionary goes on the basis of usage rather than perceived correctness. So basically if it is in common usage it is a correct spelling. Hence slang has made it's way into the dictionary.<br /><br />What bugs me is that we have fallen into the trap that Whiskey is the correct spelling for Irish Whisk(e)y. But it is a nice differentiation to have I suppose.<br /><br />The formalisation of the spelling was created by IDG (Now IDL) whether consciously or unconsciously but historically there is irrefutable evidence that Irish distilleries spelt it both ways and it may be as close to 50/50. Cork and Belfast both seem to have big traditions of spelling it whisky.</div>
