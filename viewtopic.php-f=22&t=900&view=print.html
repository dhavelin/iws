				<div class="content">Last call for the behind the scenes trip to the new Kilbeggan operation<br /><br />Ally has a few places remaining on this Fridays trip to Kilbeggan!<br /><br />To celebrate Kilbeggan Distillery becoming a fully operational distillery in its own right, we have organised a day trip to Kilbeggan on Friday 15th October.<br /> <br />When Cooley initially fired up the world’s smallest pot still, I thought it was primarily so tourists could see a pot still in operation. I didn’t imagine that they’d be adding a grain silo, mill, hot water tank, fermentation vats, mash tun, as well as the second still they added in 2009. By the time we get there, this distillery will be making single malt whiskey from start to finish!  In a very quiet fashion, these additions have increased the number of Irish Distilleries from 3 to 4, with Cooley owning 50% of Irish Distilleries (not Irish Distillers may I add)! Quite a claim for this independent Irish company!<br /> <br />Tickets are €75 and include coach, tour, tasting plus a delicious three course lunch courtesy of Locke’s Pantry Restaurant with wines from Wines on the Green. Ticket numbers will be limited on what I’m sure will be a popular trip. Places will only be booked/reserved once payment in full has been received.<br /> <br /> <br />Itinerary<br /> <br />Friday 15th October, 2010<br /> <br />Depart Dawson Street, Dublin 10am<br /> <br />Arrive Kilbeggan Distillery, County Westmeath 11.15am<br /> <br />Tea, coffee, dram<br /> <br />Tour of both the new and the old distilleries, with a few tasting drams along the way.<br /> <br />Three Course Lunch 1-2.30pm<br />Supplied by Lockes’s Pantry Restaurant with some whiskey inspired dishes.<br />Wines supplied by Wines on the Green.<br /> <br />Warehouse Tour plus tasting of some fabulous single casks, we’ll be bottling for Christmas. 2.30-3.30pm<br /> <br />Coach departs 4.30pm, arriving back in Dawson Street approx 6pm.<br /> <br />Places will only be booked once payment in full has been received.<br /> <br /> <br /> Sláinte<br /> <br />Ally.</div>
