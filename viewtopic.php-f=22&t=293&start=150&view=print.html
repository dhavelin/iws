I know myself I'd love the opportunity to get a half barrel or the like of Connemara for instance. especially the quality (and cost of the 16/17yo single casks).  Or a quarter of the Kilbeggan like Zoltan as the older Tyrconnel is absolutely gorgeous stuff.</div>

				<div class="content">Don't think many people will have tried this one. Bruchladdich Octomore Orpheus, 61%, 140 ppm phenol. It's not my fault, Michael at the CWS told me it'd be a collector's item and there were only 6 bottles available. Naturally it'll never be collected in my house!<br /><br />Anyway, on to the whisky. Supposedly finished in casks from Chateau Petrus, one of the most expensive wines ever. Immediately reminded me of the Connemara 17 year old Single Cask I have. (Even though that's only 46%). I was never very good at describing whiskies but I will have to thank Michael. (For persuading me to buy it!) I've always liked sherry/wine finished whiskies and it took me a while, but I did eventually get into the peaty/smokey scotches. With a little water, this thing is just unbelievable! A little sweet, but the peat more than knocks that for 6! So, for a whisky with a phenol count of 140 ppm, I guess you could say it's a little less rough than you'd expect. Personally, I think it's the wine casks that did that. But they really finished it off nicely!!<br /><br />Maybe if someone like Adrian or JC tastes it, they can give a better description, but I could just drink this all night. Which is rather unfortunate, considering it's rather limited and costs 100 euro a bottle. Anyway, there you have it. My latest acquisition.</div>

				<div class="content">Nice buy Brian, sounds like your enjoying it too ...<br /><br />However there has been a few negatives about the Octomore releases.<br /><br />Horrendously over priced for such a young whiskey due to it's so called &quot;collectablity&quot; and the peatyness eventhough has been hearalded at 140 ppm has no more peat punch than Ardbeg which is around 55ppm or Laphroaig which is around 40ppm.<br /><br />However if it is a nice whisky that is all that counts at the end of the day as sometimes too much talk about this that and the other actually over shadows the whisky in the end....<br /><br /><br />Got a couple Ballydoyles today myself. Will be interesting if this is any good.</div>

				<div class="content">Have to agree with you on 3 counts, Adrian.<br /><br />1. Yes, it is horrendously overpriced for a 5 year old whiskey, no matter what the peat levels.<br />2. Yes, I was expecting a hell of a bigger peat 'hit' than the one I got.<br />3. Yes, I'm enjoying it enormously, so who really cares about 1 and 2 above!<br /><br />Brian</div>

				<div class="content">Has anyone had the Distiller's Edition Talisker? I've had more than a few of the Classic Malts distiller's edition finishes and i think this one outstrips the others by a massive margin. Its got a kind of musky dark chocolate sweetness that i've never seen in Talisker along with a baseline of the familiar Talisker 'pepper n' peat' profile. I just bought a bottle of it and really love it and i'm hoping someone out there loves it as much as i do so we can grin at eachother over the internet.</div>

				<div class="content">I've had one or two bottles and yes I agree, it's a great whisky. In fact the Lagavulin, Caol Ila and Talisker DEs are all great great whiskies that really do add something to the standard expressions. Not better per se, especially in the case of Lagavulin, but different enough to be worth shelling out for. I've also got the Clynelish, Oban and Cragganmore ones open and, IMO, these are much better than the standard expressions.<br /><br />So yes, I can grin back at the Talisker DE. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
