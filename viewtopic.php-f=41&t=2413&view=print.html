				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />I recently hosted an Irish Whiskey Tasting in Connecticut USA. A guest asked me about this old bottle of Bonded Jameson from Woodford Bourne, he had found gutting a house.<br />Looking to get a rough age and value. Any help our direction would be much appreciated.<br /><br />The labels are in great shape and the cork is fully sealed with foil in place. <br />Best,<br /><br />Damian.</div>

				<div class="content">This I reckon would be 50's or 60's and would have more than likley been bottled by a local establishment of the time.<br /><br />J&amp;A Taylor were &quot;Sole&quot; importers in the New York area so guessing Woodford Bourne are similar in Connecticut.<br /><br />What is the fill level like? It can have an effect on value.<br /><br />The value varies wildly and on Ebay in the state would not normally get over $200 however it should probably be worth $3-400.<br /><br />I personally don't think they are hugely rare but others disagree, it is all very subjective.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_scratch.gif" alt=":scratch:" title="Scratch" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Well spotted Raven. I was only familiar with their Jubilee bottlings. <br /><br />The 7 year olds are still common enough but have been fetching high prices at auction. I think this is because retailers are asking such high prices that bidders are starting to pay more. It's like the price is creating the market instead of the other way around if that makes sense. <br /><br />The Jameson's 15 PPS is a good example of this. They were available for €150 and less for years then the Whisky Exchange put some up for £450 &amp; £500 then the prices started skyrocketing.</div>
