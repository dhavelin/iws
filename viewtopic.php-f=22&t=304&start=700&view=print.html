				<div class="content">Knocked a 80's/90's bottle of Glenfiddich on the head over the week-end. Must admit that it was a very enjoyable easy to drink whiskey. Very acceptable and definitely for me I would go for the fiddich over the livett any day. Not an overly memorable malt but just like a bottle of Blackbush, Powers or Jameson an excellent one to have with friends. <br /><br />No really low bottles left  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  so decided that I needed to treat myself ... nothing for it ... a Bushmills Single Cask Sherry at 53.7% ... wow this really does not feel like a cask strength offering but is no shrinking violet either and is bursting full of rich fruit flavours along with a lovely smoothness ...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">I am currently taking on the Knappogue Castle line that is available to me.  I started with the 1951 rare whiskey, Ireland's oldest known Single Malt Whiskey still available.  I enjoyed this sip by sip, less than a dram at a time and spent around three hours enjoying one pour.  First off,  the nose was overwhelmingly exquisite.  Unlike anything I have huffed before.  I could still smell the nose on my hands the next morning.  At first sip I was surprised how unprepared my palate was to take on such complexity.  Such a distinct difference after the nose that I sat and pondered the taste for quite a while.  Then I ordered a Guinness to try a different approach.  I found that after each sip of the Guinness I made new discoveries about this extraordinary whiskey.  It reverberated along my palate with loads of deep sweet textured flavours similar to the Jamaican pot still I read about.  As I enjoyed the whiskey further I added a bottle of Ballygowan Irish spring still water into the mix.  First cleansing my palate between sips and eventually adding a slight drop to the last dram of whiskey.  In this action I experienced another characteristic all together.  As I am new to this style of tasting I do not offer a lot of tasting notes but I will say that this was the most incredible whiskey experience I have had to date.  I had the Whiskey out of a Waterford Crystal Glass which also added to the moment and I must say I highly recommend this vintage.<br /><br />Next, I tackled the Knappogue Castle 1992.  I did this because in my reading I found that Jim Murray rated the 1992 slightly higher than the 1951.  I quickly noticed that the nose was no where as powerful as the unique experience I had with the 1951, however the first taste I found to be much nicer than the 1951.  I am not really sure what I expected at first taste with the 1951, but for the money I most likely placed a lot of pressure on it. (another reason I am glad that I took so much time with the tasting.)  I followed the same procedure with the 1992 and noticed the taste developed into something phenomenal.  If Honey were a flower it would taste like Knappogue Castle 1992.  Light bodied, almost fragile yet intact, dainty and divine.  Maybe like drinking a liquid honey flavored diamond.  This whiskey went down much faster, approx 45 minutes.  (Could be due to the more affordable price point)  I had each of these in RiRa Irish Pub in Las Vegas, NV.  My next whiskey in this line will be the Knappogue Castle 1994 rated at 95 by Jim Murray.  I will continue this post when I have finished that vintage.  Until then, happy water of life to everyone.</div>

				<div class="content">Nice post Mulltea <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br />The Knappogue range is, broadly speaking, very good. You would also expect broad differences between the vintages considering they are from three different distilleries; Tullamore, Bushmills and Cooley. Have you picked up on any of these so far? Not sure yet why they decided to move from vintages to age-statements but time will tell whether it has any effect on the percieved quality to the more general audience.<br />Enjoy the journey <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ,<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content"><a href="http://irishwhiskeychaser.webs.com/knappoguecastle.htm" class="postlink">Check here</a> for which vintage is from which Distillery.<br /><br />The explanation give by Castle Brands to move away from the Vintage to an aged product was that it was more transparent to the consumer as to what you were buying and how old it was. I was sad to see the vintage go as it was nice to collect but I suppose I can see their point. However they do plan to release the odd vintage and limited edition as they have done wit he the 1998 and the 16yo sherry finish.<br /><br />By the way John Hansell reckons that the Sherry finish is one of their best to date ... unfortunately only available in the states  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">I just had a Blue Curacao. (I wouldn't mention that but I didn't want to stray too far off topic.)<br /><br />What I like about vintages is that it's obvious when you are getting a new whiskey. What is confusing about Knappogue's vintages is that they are years of distillation rather than bottling, and that's different to the other Irish vintage series, Midleton.</div>

				<div class="content">Great responses, everyone, truly and thank you.  I have since also tried the 1994, which i felt had a few similar characteristics to the 1992, which is surprising in that they are of different distilleries.  The body of the 1994 had much more character to me and seemed to develop upon the palate a lot nicer.  I jumped into a Jefferson bourbon after, that I was disappointed with, although I tried it beside of a Jameson Gold which is one of my 'go too's' and also I was looking for the Jefferson 12yr that I had read about and not the regular label Jefferson that I ended up with.  I should have shopped around harder.  I need to begin feeling out a scotch line or two in the coming weeks.  I want to go with Ardmore or Kilohmen if I am able to find them.  Best wishes, everyone.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi John, I also have a bottle of this ... I really liked it at first then I went off it but have not tasted it in a while. I remember seeing these in the warehouses in Springbank on the tour of 2007. The casks really stood out as they were lovely and white and looked immaculate even the rings still had a bright metal look to them.  <br /><br />Here are some notes I took ages ago, don't really do them any more though.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Nose:</span> There is a real earthiness to this, kinda Lagavulin like witrh out the layered sherry, and heavy raw malt. I thought it was quite spirity at first but this seems to subside. Ripe fruits and plasticine &amp; wax and some other heavy aromas I can't put my finger on at the moment.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Taste:</span> Nice bit of sweetness that &quot;gobstopper core&quot; type sweetness and oak sap but not in the bad way not like the nose, quite dry early on too.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Finish:</span> A rich finish and an unusual finish but really enjoyable which may sound strange from the above comments.</div>

Nice vanilla and spice and I really enjoy lounging over this. This is where I can't work the points system. If I was really honest I'd mark it down for the finish but I just could not bare to mark it down as I love it so much, I know weird.  Then on to a Jameson Gold ... much more mouth watering compared to the Powers 12 but quite a bit sweeter which is just about reined in by the wood and a rewarding finish.<br /><br />IDL odyssey over ... now on to Bushmills 16yo ... a real smoothie of an Irish whiskey. You really need to roll some of these smooth Irish whiskeys around you palate and gums to get the full spectrum of flavours. <br /><br />And this reminds me, it has struck me why Irish whiskey possibly gets a bit of a raw deal ... in instances it's really smooth, possibly too smooth for some palates and something which peat heads cant seem to get to grips with. I know myself as a confirmed peat head I often just want something to blast away the cobwebs like a Laphroaig. But I remember reading a passage from the wise and sagely Mr Michael Jackson that once a whiskey enthusiast gets over the fascination of the peated Islay's they should then explore the the finer points and nuances of non peated whisk(e)y and he specifically mentioned Irish and Lowland Scotch as prime examples of wonderful whiskeys that need to be explored for their subtle but multilayer-ed taste spectrum. So the next time you think a whiskey is a bit too smooth wait for a quite time and sit back and give it your full attention and see if you can get anything extra from it. Learn to enjoy some smooth time  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
