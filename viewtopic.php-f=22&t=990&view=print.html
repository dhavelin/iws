				<div class="content">There is plenty of Oak Aged Vodka about.<br /> <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://its-woodka.de/">http://its-woodka.de/</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />We discussed this on another forum and there is no definitive answer. Partly due to the fact that any nation can have it's own whisky production regs, ( e.g. in India you can distill molasses and age it in wood and sell it as whisky ). If it is made from 100% grains and distilled in copper stills ( pot or column ) and aged for at least 2 ( as in the USA ) or 3 ( everywhere else ) years then why not. Starka is infused with herbs <span style="font-weight: bold">after</span> distillation ( iirc ), so probably no, it isn't whisky in anyone's books.<br /> <br />Vodka, it seems, can be made from any ingredient ( grains, potatoes, fruit, molasses ). As far as i can make out what makes vodka vodka is the fact it is distilled many more times than other spirits to a very high abv - neutral spirit.</div>

				<div class="content">True, different countries have different regulations. I suppose I was wondering if Starka could be considered whiskey here, under Irish or Scottish regulations (apart from the regs on place of distillation, obviously.)<br />It appears to be grain distilled twice, rather than the usual vodka method of distilling from anything containing sugars umpteen times.<br />Would the herbal infusion be enough to consider it not whiskey, though? If Bushmills macerated herbs into its malt, would that malt stop being whiskey?</div>
