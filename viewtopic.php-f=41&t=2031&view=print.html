				<div class="content">Hi <br /><br />Could anyone give me information on a small bushmills glass hip flask? My father has had it for years and is now wondering if it has any value. It holds 2 fl ozs.<br />Any help would be greatly appreciated. On the front it says &quot;THE OLD BUSHMILLS DISTILLERY CO LTD IRELAND TRADE MARK ESTD 1784&quot; and it has no cracks or chips.<br /><br />Kind regards<br /><br />Louise</div>

				<div class="content">Sounds an interesting item. Probably from an advertising campaign<br />pre mid 1960's as they only started using the 1608 date after that time.<br />Occasionally you would find stuff like that coming up on E-Bay. Upload a <br />picture if possible. Hard to say what it would be worth but if it's any help<br />I do not recall simiiar item coming up in the recent past.</div>

				<div class="content">2 US fluid ounces Is about 60ml &amp; 2 imperial fluid ounces is about 57ml both of which are called miniatures.<br />Bushmills miniatures are quite common.<br />The date 1784 was on Bushmills bottles up until at least 1972.<br />Without a picture and based on the information you provided it could date anywhere between 1930-60. <br />Without a label only worth a $1 or so.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />Raven, thanks for the info. I haven't seen one online and I have done a lot of searching. I will try get a pic uploaded tomorrow.<br />Thewhiskeybro, thanks also for the information. I didn't realise that it would of had a label. Although its of no value, it would still be great to know its story. <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Louise</div>
