				<div class="content">Started watching &quot;Copper&quot;, on Showcase here in Canada, on Sunday.  It is a police drama set in the Five Points slums of New York City in 1864.  The show focuses on an Irish American (I think the dialogue implied that he came over to the US as a young child) detective by the name of Corcoran who appears to be one of the law-abiding cops of that time period.  It's focus is split between crime fighting and the ongoing bribery and other general skullduggery going on within elite society at that time, as it pertained to the &quot;management and re-development&quot; (i.e. how to make the most money) of the slums of New York at that time.<br /><br />No, Daniel Day Lewis and Leo DiCaprio do not make a cameo in this show (they died the previous year in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;). <br /><br />Whiskey is the primary drink of choice throughout the first two episodes, though with no brand specific references.  I would also think that it would be a safer drink of choice than regular water, given the lack of sanitation in most of NYC during that time period.</div>

				<div class="content">Mentioned earlier by another poster about Jameson in Sons of Anarchy - In season 3 there are some episodes shot in Belfast where Powers features in some scenes being drunk by O'Farrel ( the IRA arms dealer )  - also in the clubhouse are some nice shots of whiskey mirrors - interestingly with both whisky and whiskey featured .</div>

				<div class="content">I just seen Emerdale Farm for the first time in years and seen they have Tullamore DEW on optic. I was surprised that Jameson hadn't availed of the product placement opportunity. Then I used sky plus and rewound and spotted a Redbreast lurking in the background. <br />Fine country ladies in it too.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">If you have not watched HBOs &quot;The Wire&quot;, youre truly missing out. Amazing show. They did 5 seasons. It is about a Narcotics/Homocide unit in the Baltimore Police Department. The main character, McNulty, is an Irish-American detective that can been seen drinking Jameson in almost every episode throughout the entire series. There is one fantastic scene involving McNulty and an open bar...<br /><br />McNulty: Jameson's, please.<br />Bartender: Bushmills alright?<br />McNulty: Bushmills?! That's Protestant whisky...<br />Bartender(glibly): The price is right, ain't it?<br />McNulty: ....Make it neat.<br /><br />If you can find the clip on youtube, its pretty funny. I suggest watching the entire series though, its a fantastic series.</div>

				<div class="content">I've just watched episodes of &quot;The Newsroom&quot; and &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; , both are very entertaining.  Jameson features in both. I expect it in Ray Donovan but noticed they have the principle female lead drinking it in The Newsroom. <br /><br />Just as I'm writing I'm looking at an earlier recording of &quot;Hardy Bucks&quot; and the viper is necking a Jameson 1 ltr bottle. Probably not a great advertising.</div>

				<div class="content">Watch the &quot;The Sons of Anarchy&quot; series currently. A bit wooden at times and cliché'd but giving it a go to see where it goes. Anyway there is an IRA interest in Season 2 and on episode 8 we see a bottle of Black Bush in a White Nazi's house of all places and then an in you face shot of Powers Gold blend in front of an IRA arms smugglers face as he gets a bullet removed from his behind  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> <br /><br /><br />Seen bushmills in a good few things but Good to see the Powers instead of the usual Jameson for a change.</div>
