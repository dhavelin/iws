				<div class="content">Your response should be the truth, not What you think. Don't think Why you should find that intriguing. <br /><br />It is a fact bottles were not to be sold. A whiskey society is for whiskey enjoyment, what would the people at  Midleton think of this action?</div>

You've been asked to be polite and civil to other users. You've been asked not to put prices up &amp; you've been asked to stick to topic. <br /><br />When the bottle that was auctioned was sold, there was no sanction for buyers to stop them from selling. You have to wait now for 2 Years. You may face denial of membership otherwise. There's nothing to stop people selling their own property. <br />Midleton couldn't care less. They got a good price for the last bottles sold. It's all good for them when a vintage bottle sells well at auction. Is there anyone who sell older Midleton at current prices? No<br /> They get their cut and their happy, then the buyer does what they wish. <br /><br />If you have a grievance about a bottle, take it up with the society committee. This is a Forum to discuss Irish Whiskey in a civil and informative fashion.</div>

				<div class="content">DublinGus,<br />For the record; <br />1) I'm not privy to prices negotiated between the Society and distilleries for casks, so if you don't mind, I won't complicate both my life and theirs by weighing in with my own individual purchasing pre-requisites.<br />2) I did not sell this bottle - don't know why you would suggest I could have anything to do with it and I take great exception to any suggestion that I would break any of the Society's formal rules.<br />3) This bottle has been around for some time and only now are you getting around to mentioning that you never received a bottle that you paid for?? And you're doing it on the Forum?? It certainly wouldn't be the way I would handle that issue; and from experience I know the guys and gals on the Committee run a pretty tight ship so I would be surprised if anything like that could happen. I would address the issue directly to them (if not done already?) and allow them to follow up from their records?<br />4) In terms of your 'ban from the Forum' (?), that's not for me to decide on, however I would probably tone down the rhetoric a little. They're a good bunch here and always willing to give help and advice, if you look for it.<br /><br />Regards,<br />J.</div>
