				<div class="content">Once again I find myself in a little Irish dilemma so what better place to come for help?<br /><br />Yesterday I was invited to have a look at a whisky collection owned by a friend of a friend, yes, I know, the old friend of a friend, but in this case it's quite true.<br />The chap in question is German but worked for many years in the late 70's to early 80's in the UK and bought a few bottles of whisky. Most are Scotch and most of these are indeed from that period as I saw some lovely older labels.<br /><br />Anyway, he has three Irish Whiskeys; Redbreast 12y, Tyrconnell and a Knappogue Castle 1993 (obviously not 70's) which says &quot;Selected Exclusively for ....&quot; and a signature which looks something like Mark Andrews.<br /><br />Any further info on these bottles, including any possible values, would be much appreciated although I don't expect any to be earth-shatteringly expensive now.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.whisky-emporium.com/Pix-pool/Irish-1.jpg" alt="Image" />  <img src="http://www.whisky-emporium.com/Pix-pool/Irish-2.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Tyrconnell was acquired as a brand by Cooley in 1988 after being dormant since 1925, when the Old Watts Distillery (producers of The Tyrconnell) closed it's doors.<br />Probabally 90's 00's. I'd say bottles are easy to find, so not of any great value. €20 - €50.<br /><br />The Redbrest is 90's not 100% but don't be surprised if you/he got €100 for the bottle (only small batch's relased at a time).<br /><br />The knappogue is 00's would be worth €30 - €60.</div>

There is a rarer version with 3 stars if people are even aware of it but this pops up enough times too for it not to be of huge value.<br /><br />The Knappogue 1993 is getting increasingly harder to find so I would suggest an estimate of 50-80Euro (82Euro is the top money this has made in Whisky Auction)<br /><br />And the Redbreast anything from 80-120.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your quick and as always, informed replies.<br /><br />When I was speaking to the chap yesterday I suggested that many of his bottles had very interesting labels, but would mostly not be in the big money range, this certainly went for the Irish ones here.<br />Value-wise, you have confirmed what I thought about the Tyrconnell, although the other two have slightly higher values than I would have put on them.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />He has a collection totalling 80 bottles, mostly from the late 70's into the 80's, but there are a couple of much more recent Scotches too, so this all fits. Now back to my spreadsheet .....<br /><br />Keith</div>

I'd say your estimates would be more on the ball. <br /><br />People aren't paying the prices they paid 4 to 5 years ago. But their are still plenty of wealthy people in Ireland who if they wanted that particular bottle of redbrest in their collection would pay €800 but me alas could just about scrape up the €120 <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> .<br /><br /> I know someday when I walk into a small pub in the west of Ireland I will see that same bottle of redbrest sitting on a shelf collecting dust!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">The Tyrconnell would be interesting because of the older art work on the label. Have a look at the newer editions and you will see what I mean. Regards from Kilkenny.

				<div class="content">Hi Keith,<br /><br />The Knappogue is from 2001 would agree with IWC on €60-€80<br /><br />The Tyrconnell 5 Star Single Malt is from 1997 - May 2004 (check the bottle for the L code printed on the glass for the year) value c. €30-€40<br /><br />The Redbreast 12 is from the mid 1990s - I'd be interested in the bottle code if you can locate it, estimated value €70-€80, €100 would be a great price,<br /><br />Regards Leo</div>

				<div class="content">Nice little haul Keith, I hope it was a bargain basement jobbie  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I'd be interested myself in the likes of the Aberlour Old Fettercairn &amp; Tamnavulin, just to see how they compare to todays offerings. Also the Dalwhinnie which I have always had a soft spot for but have not had it in a long time.<br /><br />Of the Irish the Redbreast of course would be the best, think it's from the 90's and possibly the label that was used for the re-launch of Redbreast in Ireland. Someone here should be able to give you a more concrete date as that one is fairly easy to date, probably a code on it but not sure if IDL used L codes pre 2000. The Knappogue is from 2001 and a 8yo, the official blurb on it was ... <span style="font-style: italic">Straw gold color. Very clean aroma and flavor-malty, with vanilla, cotton candy, honey and subtle floral notes. Light in body and somewhat creamy in texture, with a soft, slightly youthful finish. </span><br /><br />Pretty much in the charachter of most of those Knappogues to me, but you have a finer palate than me so you could tell me  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />The Tyrconnell is probably another early bottling of the Tyrconnell which was re-introduced by Cooley. Late 1990's early 2000's possibly. I would imagine it is only a 4-5 year old but that is all a bit vague.<br /><br />Enjoy  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi again Adrian and many thanks for your comments.<br /><br />I'm not sure about bargain basement, but I was certainly very happy with the overall price I paid for 10 bottles today. The share of the price for these three together was three figures, but only just  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />A few weeks ago I bought something like 17 bottles from his collection, I'll see if I can find the pictures as again many were from this era.<br />Your idea of dates fits well with what I thought which was based on the time this chap was living in England and bought most of these bottles. In fact I've just had the Ardbeg code confirmed as bottled in 2000.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Malty.<br />(Keith)</div>
