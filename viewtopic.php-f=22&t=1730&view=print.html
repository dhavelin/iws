HAve they changed the mash bills???<br /><br />We don't actually know what the mash mills are but it is supposed to be with in a range for certain types. This was from a source a good few years back but could just as easily be part of the once growing legend that was the so called secret IDL back in the day. Things have changed alot since so I would stick with what you  have been given and not confuse it with possible hearsay.</div>
