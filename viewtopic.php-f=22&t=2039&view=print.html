				<div class="content">€180 ok for limited supply but it has the sound of a long term available premium over priced bottle which will undoubtedly be a fantastic dram if others are to go by!<br /><br />For anyone going whiskylive the 15 for tasting redbreast family sounds cheap!</div>

				<div class="content">While it's nice to try the new Powers, Paddy and Redbreast 21 at the Irish distillers preview event, I feel the Powers is over priced as it should be available to everyone. The others are very limited and you can argue a case for the price. All premium whiskeys are now gone up in price. I was buying regular Redbreast for €40 3 years ago, it's now €57. This is in light of our resession. <br />Its killing the domestic market I feel. Premium whiskey should be accessible to everyone. It is fast becoming a elitist drink. It could very easily come back and bite them.</div>

				<div class="content">Tasted Redbreast 21 yesterday evening courtesy of IDL.<br /><br />The 27-Year Old component in the vatting is &quot;Trad Pot&quot; from 1985 which would make it a cousin of the dearly departed Jameson 15 Millenium Edition - also distilled in 1985!   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />The absinthe-y note on the nose is intriguing to say the least.<br /><br />If I can find a buyer for my spare kidney I may buy two bottles, as this is probably the last chance to taste/nose Trad Pot from this era.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif" alt=":geek:" title="Geek" /> <br /><br />Discuss.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_ugeek.gif" alt=":ugeek:" title="Uber Geek" /></div>

				<div class="content">Great to see justification in the price tag even if it is such a price!<br /><br />I would have preferred to have seen stated limited release even so many bottles per year with annual vintages of the 21yo.<br /><br />For sure it wont sell in bulk but one has to wonder is supply really limited as numeric sequencing or even annual allotments would seem more appropriate to a &quot;limited&quot; whiskey!</div>
