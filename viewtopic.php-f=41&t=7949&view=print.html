				<div class="content">Is that the bottle in Adverts for €450?<br />They usually take down ads selling alcohol but you'd never know. Those bottles are popping up at auction regularly enough. Prices vary. €450 maybe a little too much, probably somewhere between €3-400. That's only a guess. A lot of collectors have it after doing the academy. It's probably something that would sell better outside of Ireland. <br />Worth checking auctions. Read up on commission and other charges before deciding. <br />Best of luck</div>
