Not even disappointing, down right daylight robbery <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /> <br /><br />The Regular Connemara is circa €35  (Possibly containing 3-6yo whiskey) but how they can price it over the Cask strength (Circa €55) I just do not know. The cask strength in itself is over priced.<br /><br />I can buy Laphroaig 10yo locally for €44 and I think I'll be sticking with it if the above is true. No matter how you dress it up it is still only a 3year old whiskey ...this should be under €30Euro unless there is something I'm missing.<br /><br />I must admit I'm getting quite cheesed off on these ludicrious pricing strategys.<br /><br />IDL used to be my bug bear but with the come back on some prices especially on the Rebdbreast 15yo they have come up in my estimations.<br /><br />However, and I'm sorry to say it, some of the stuff comming out of Cooley is frightfully over priced.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /> <br /><br />Mister Cranky rasies his head again .... think I'll just change my name to Mister Cranky  <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> .</div>

If more people were simply to take a step back and question why they are being asked to pay for products that really shouldn't be commanding such ridiculous prices, then we would have a far more equitable system. <br /><br />Meanwhile we have foreign producers selling tried and tested, strongly branded and longer-matured products for less over here. How is that possible?</div>

				<div class="content">i was pumped for the turf mór, but at that price they can sod off.  and yea, typical tell you it will cost €50 and then its €40 when it comes out so people think they will be getting a deal.  i will wait until lap10yo is on sale for xmas up north and just go get like 5 bottles for £25 a piece.  gotta go up anyway for the xmas liqour stash.  i think mr. cranky is rearing his ugly head over here again too, lol</div>

We have positioned the whiskey above our Connemara Cask strength and below our Connemara 12 Year old, in Ireland this price point would be circa €60.00.</div></blockquote><br /><br />They were nice enough to send me a review sample. It's a cracking dram indeed, albeit the price tag won't be to everybody's liking.

				<div class="content">Excellent Oliver, nice trasting notes and quite helpful, thanks for posting.<br /><br />I would love for this to become a great success and just hope the price tag does not detract from that. <br /><br />I personally think they should go the Laphroaig and Aberlour route. Come out with a cracking beast of a whiskey which can grab the headlins yet be at a price that people find attractive. This for me would build the brand quicker and get it more attention in the long run.<br /><br />Laphroaig came out with their Quarter Cask (No age statement) and it has become a classic yet it is under £30 sterling.<br /><br />Aberlour also released the wonderfully acclaimed Abunadh (A cask strength no age stated sherry monster) This too has a relatively modest price circa £34sterling.<br /><br />After the initial hype dies down you want people to come back to this bottle and buy it which in turn will keep interest and focus in the brand. <br /><br />I do with the Turf Mór the best of luck but I do fear for it, time will tell.</div>

				<div class="content">I think things are a bit different to the Laphroaig QC or the Aberlour a'Bunadh. These are permanent corner stones of the distillery ranges whereas the Turf Mor is as one-off bottling in the &quot;Small Batch&quot; series. When it's sold it will be gone for good. And I have no doubt it will sell, although the price will certainly slow down sales. You still get good value for your money but given its young age a slightly more moderate price tag would have been preferable, IMHO.</div>

For me, when a young whisky is priced up like this i can't help but think 'that's plain greedy'.<br /> <br />Is this truly a 'one off'? Surely they have plenty of this batch set aside for ageing further.</div>

				<div class="content">when they distilled turf mor, that was a time the malting company stoped making 15-20ppm<br />they only make 55ppm, and that is what they getting at present, so they mix it with unpeated malt to make regular Connemara, and add a bit to Lockes<br /><br />what i was told yesterday, they have no more heavily peated whiskey in stock, <br />but they have some interesting stuff maturing in barrels, so there will be small batch collection 3, when thisone is gone <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />on the price point, first this is cask strength, 60-65 here, that means 40-45 in germany, uk and NI, so that will be the source to buy from, what a lot of us do when travel</div>

				<div class="content">As I mentioned earlier, although the price seems to be around €60 in Ireland, Germany should be more like €50 as CS is about €40 and 12y about €60.<br />Now, as I once paid €75 for a Connemara single cask I really don't see too much of a problem with €50 for the Turf Mór although anything under that would be a bonus, even though this is younger than the 15y single cask of which I speak.<br /><br />The press release also speaks of competition with a &quot;Competitive Line-up&quot; where the TM is shown lined up against the following:<br />Octomore, Supernova, (TM), Lagavulin 12 CS, Laphroaig 10 CS<br /><br />Maybe this will help understand how Cooley are marketing and promoting the Turf Mór.<br />Malty</div>
