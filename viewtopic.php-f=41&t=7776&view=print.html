				<div class="content">Hi I was wondering if anyone knows where I can find a bottle of Midleton Dair Gaelach Tree 8. I know that Trees No. 1, 6 and 8 were destined for US markets.  I have bottles from Trees No 1 and 6 but I have not found a single bottle from Tree 8. Any help would be appreciated. Noel</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Noel,<br /><br />I stand to be corrected, but Tree 1 went exclusively to South Africa as far as I know.<br /><br />Tree 6 is still relatively easy to find in the US.<br /><br />Tree 8 is more difficult to find, with only a few retailers carrying according to my sources.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Cheers TWB</div>

				<div class="content">I've heard that the South African allocation didn't sell so most were repackaged for the US market. That means the SA ones out there would be very rare. This has yet to be confirmed.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi All,<br />I found Tree 1 last summer in Chicago.  Then Tree 6 on the east coast...plenty of availability.  <br /><br />When I called Midleton gift shop, they told me Tree 8 went to South Africa...not south America as I had assumed.  Then i scowered the net and anything in south africa.  Nothing. So I tried South America (why not).  Still no luck!  I was completely confused at this point.<br /><br />So,  I walk into a liquor store in florida, and BAM! There it was! I got the one bottle they had out.  Said that was it.  No more coming.  There has to be more than one bottle of Tree 8 in the world. maybe they have all been drunk or sold to pubs to pour. i really don't know.  <br /><br />Sorry, for the long answer but I am still on the hunt. Should i turn up on another bottle ill post it here.<br /><br />Cheers<br />MC</div>
