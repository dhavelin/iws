				<div class="content">I've really loved the Connemara whiskey family over the past few years. I've had a couple of bottles of the standard peated. I also had a bottle of the cask strength (fantastic) and have only tasted the 12 and turf mór.<br /><br />A friend of mine is also a fan. He recently bought himself and a friend a Connemara Peated in a bar. He said he was disappointed with it, and thought it had changed significantly. He sent me a photo of the bottle. It was the rebranded one, reflecting the Kilbeggan Distilling Co. name, as oppose to the previous Cooley label.<br /><br />Can anyone tell me what, if anything, has changed in the Connemara bottles? If there is a change, is it just the entry level one?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Sláinte saol.<br />Eric.</div>

				<div class="content">I tried it again recently myself after seeing your post. I think it's softened compared with the last time it tried it. I don't know if it's me or is it different. I'd like to try a side by side and see then. <br /><br />I'll have to get another cask strength too.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm afraid I haven't tried the 12yo nor the Turf Mor, only the new Kilbeggan rebranded NAS and I have to admit that I found it quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The other day I had a dram of the Distillers Edition bottle and I was not able to tell the difference, sorry <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Is it worth to pay the difference of the 12yo Connemara? It almost costs twice the NAS!!!</div>

				<div class="content">I haven't had the new versions yet so cannot comment on it being different.<br /><br />However from the past bottles I always found the Cask Strength to be the most agreeable (and aggressive) of the Connemaras. Just to put that into context I really like Laphroaig.<br /><br />Then the regular NAS which has always been just okay for me. <br /><br />The single Casks and the 12yo always were much more refined with more rounded sweetness and less aggressive peated tones. These are nice refined whiskeys and not the Peat reaks that people may expect.</div>
