				<div class="content">Doing a bit of a clear out of &quot;stuff&quot; in my office and came across a few interesting samples I had forgotten about.<br /><br />Currently sipping an old Dunphy's from the 50's.<br /><br />This was a blend made by IDL and obviously contains potstill of the old style. A bit salty on the nose and sweet barkey. Musty, oily and buttery on the palette (very soft comforting mouth feel), a nice gentle sweetness, sprinkling of dusty spice, some (lemon) balm mint and a touch soapy. Not unpleasant but could see myself getting very bored of it quickly. However I could also see this pairing very well with a stout or dark ale so possibly a good pub accompaniment back in the day.<br /><br /><br />Will be trying a Preston's 10yo Jameson next.</div>

				<div class="content">Redbreast 15y. celebrating that I finally are going to return to Ireland. Last time was 2001 so it's high time. Back then I did not drink whiskey at all so this time I have one more aspect to explore. the Redbreast is a great whiskey but I would like to have some more. I love the sherry tone, the oily texture and the full bodie. What would you suggest more for me from this list?

				<div class="content">the prices for Redbreast are very good.

				<div class="content">The Black barrel I feel is not as good as it portraits to be. Now don't get me wrong, nice Jameson but I was expecting much more from the initial descriptions.<br /><br />Basically for me it is a stepping stone between the regular Jameson and Jameson 12.<br /><br />It has a much richer flavour of the regular Jameson but not the body (oiliness) of the Jameson 12yo.<br /><br />There is more wood in it though but as with the majority of Midleton products they are blended to be well balanced with no one trait overly dominating.<br /><br />However it has been a while since I tasted it but I liked it and the bottle did not last long  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">Connemara Turf Mor!  Wow, this is great stuff.  I was a big fan of Connemara Cask Strength in the tall bottle years ago.  This rivals that experience.  So peaty and delicious.  I missed it last time it was around because it was not sold in the US and I didn't know about the wonders of ordering from Ireland. <br /><br />I got this from Celtic Whiskey Shop. Also ordered a Tyrconnell 10 Year Port Cask. It is the only Tyrconnell missing from my collection.  Every other Tyrconnell I've been able to find here but Port Cask is elusive so I added it to my Turf Mor order.  Well the order arrives but the Tyrconnell is Sherry Cask, which I already have.  Sent CWS an email before bed and when I woke up had a reply that they would dispatch the Port Cask and I could keep the Sherry Cask!  Great customer service by CWS.  I will be a customer for life!</div>

It's so hard to pick anyway - like choosing favorite family members! I do recall Slieve Foy was well liked on its own merits in addition to having a fun personal connection for a member of the group. The Millenium Malt and Palace Bar pours may have been the two with the most hands in the air during our 'vote early and often' poll at the end. Those were the two I voted for, although I probably most appreciated the opportunity to try the two Teelings. I recall reading reviews of them when they were released and wondering if I'd ever have the opportunity to try them. Well done to Pat indeed!</div>
