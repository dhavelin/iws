				<div class="content">I was at it on Friday evening. I must have spent close to 4 hours there. It's thin enough on the whiskey side - Teeling, Midleton, Alltech - nothing you won't be familiar with though value was good. Paddy Centenary, Yellow Spot €5 a measure, for example. Jameson Caskmates was only €2.50.<br /><br />I like cider and there was a good selection of new stuff and festival specials. The Stonewell Cask and Tawny ciders stood out for me, for example.<br /><br />I mostly just enjoy talking to the producers. As you know I'm not a beer fan but I chatted with some of them too. It was a very pleasant evening. You choose on the way in if you want a beer glass or whiskey glass. The whiskey glass is very nice. (Every stand has plastic beer glasses so not having a beer glass wasn't a problem.)</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for that Dave. If only the 3 whiskey producers are at it I might give it a miss. I like the odd beer but not enough to travel from Wexford. <br /><br />I was hoping to Walsh's, Dublin Whiskey Company, Drumshanbo and maybe some Poitín producers would be at it.</div>
