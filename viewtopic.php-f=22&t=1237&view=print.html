				<div class="content">I've failry mixed opinions on the different Tullamores.<br /><br />I think the 12yo and Heritage aren't bad at all - the 12yo is like a &quot;not quite as good&quot; version on the Jameson 12 - the Heritage is also a pretty good pot still blend.<br /><br />The Black I really like - not as a sit around comtemplating and pontificating whiskey but a good session / drinker's whiskey. It would be a great whiskey to have in a pub with a pint - that's where I'd really like to see it. It would be great if grants could push it out in that direction.<br /><br />Never been mad on the Tullamore NAS - It's just a little too rough and grainy for me.<br /><br />I do not like the malt at all. Just can't take to it. The nose reminds me of baby barf. I know it's made up of sherry, port, madeira and bourbon tyrconnell, all of which I love, but he combination just doesn't work. Maybe I've just got a bad bottle.</div>

Everything should smell like baby barf. <br /><br />I remember tasting the 12 yr old at Whiskylive and being surprised how much I liked it.</div>

				<div class="content">I personally don't care much about the look of a bottle, but this is a marketing thing. Maybe they want to be more attractive to a bigger audience? btw I laughed at the term &quot;different definition of ‘Irishness’&quot; of the press text <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />And I agree that the older Tullamore is good. I like its taste as well, especially the 12 year old.</div>

				<div class="content">You are right, kinspa, it's a marketing thing. They did research in their various markets and discovered that their rectangular bottle shape is associated with whiskey in the Czech Republic, for example, but not in the US. It depends on what consumers are used to. So their new bottle is an attempt to bridge these different perceptions with a single design.</div>
