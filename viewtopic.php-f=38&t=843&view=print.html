				<div class="content">Once again the tension is building. Two of hurling's Titans will face each other on the sacred ground of Pairc Ui Chrocaigh to win the much coveted Liam MacCarthy. Special year for Kilkenny as they try for a fifth successive title in a row and it would prove an even more special year for Tipperary if they managed to stop them!<br /><br />And where will I be? On the couch?; so close to the TV that I can count the pixels on the ref's face?; making complementary comments about the skill of the opposition? No, I'll be either in Slovenia or Croatia - neither one a hurling stronghold I hasten to add!!. I'm really hoping I can get some form of Setanta TV/Internet coverage for the game!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />I'll be hoping for the 5-in-a-row btw <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

Kilkenny had a bad semi in preperation as Cork were muck ... probably one of the worst displays we've seen in a long time from Cork in a semi. Tipp on the other hand had a slightly more even contest but even so they always seemed Comfortable against Waterford.</div>

				<div class="content">Certainly not locals.<br />Almost definitely hurling 'fans' up in the city for the match.<br />Every time there's a big GAA match, the area gets destroyed. Rubbish, puke and other bodily emanations all over the place, shouting their heads off till all hours, and of course the casual vandalism like with my car.<br />It never happens after concerts or indeed soccer or rugby games. It's only the GAA crowd cause the trouble.<br />Getting pretty sick of it at this stage. The car's been vandalised three times after big GAA matches in the past six months. It's ruined, covered in malicious scratches and now there's a cracked windscreen too. To be honest, I'm thinking of moving as a result.<br />I wish these people would learn to control themselves and not treat a match at Croke Park as an excuse to behave like drunken cavemen. I'm absolutely dreading Sunday. I'm actually praying there's a fifteen hour hailstorm or a fire at the stadium and the whole thing's cancelled on Saturday night.</div>

				<div class="content">I think they serve alcohol at GAA matches, but you can't drink in your seat, only at the bars. And it's both codes. The worst I had till my car window got done was during the football earlier in the summer, when I had to eject one drunk from weeing in my front garden in front of my daughter (who was watching from the front room) in the middle of the afternoon while the game was actually on.<br />The real trouble occurs with people bringing their own drink, then getting tanked up further at certain bars in the area. And the Gardai won't do anything to restrict those few businesses from trading late into the night for some reason (GAA heads, I presume) so we're stuck with the endless late licenses and the trouble.<br />I tend to find less hassle if Dublin are playing, because the fans all head home afterwards. Sort of the same if nearby counties are playing, like Wicklow or Meath. Though Kildare fans hung around for ages last week despite being royally humiliated by Down.<br />If they're from down the country though, they hang about all day and into the night, which is when the hassle happens. Falling out of pubs at 3 in the morning, it seems like craic to them to destroy local residents' property. Of course, during the daytime, they merely pee all over the street and lash rubbish into the garden. My front garden is all weeds now, because there's no point trying to make it nice. Same with all my neighbours too.</div>
