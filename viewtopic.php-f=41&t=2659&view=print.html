In ways very collectible bottle and went for huge sums pre- economic crash but have not seen too many fetch anywhere near that since.<br /><br />The whiskey in it though is far from the heights Irish whiskey can be.<br /><br />So basically it is a collectible for the sake of being a collectible.<br /><br />These are the types of bottlings that confuse me. Yes its a rare bottling but the whiskey is very average so why the huge premiums?</div>

				<div class="content">Very collectible I would agree mostly as it was never launched<br />and what exists trades in a grey market so to speak and like the <br />equally rare 'Hennessy Na Geanna' carries an iconic name. At auction <br />or privately I could still see this going for 500Euro. Lot more worth the <br />money I think than some of the new 'collectibles' flooding the market. <br />I may be wrong but I cannot recall one on the 'WHISKYAUCTION' website <br />which I view usually as being a template of how much is actually out there.<br />It's possible to trawl their archives of past auctions to check.</div>
