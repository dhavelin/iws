				<div class="content">Got to drop into them last Friday - and it has changed! Much more modern inside with more windows, brightness and the ground floor is all on one level (still have to say I did like the old nook and crannies and character but things do change) - still very unsure about the large window on the side of the building as you approach it from the east, suppose it is there to highlight a potstill and give light to that floor - but still It looks out of place with the building for me.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">&quot;Ground floor highlight was having a small one in the Snug! &quot;</span><br /><br />All the tours are now fully guided with many audio visual pieces – very nicely interweaved to keep the tour flowing and interesting along the way.<br /><br />Of course it all finished with a tasting of 3 whiskeys (standard, the 12 &amp; the single malt) in an impressive tasting area.<br /><br />In addition to the building and experience changes, a new whiskey is available exclusively from the visitors centre, <br /><br />Tullamore Dew Warehouse Release is a NAS sherry finished whiskey, bottled at 46%, costing approximately €50.<br />From initial tasting it does seem to be along the lines of the Black and on bringing it to a small tasting on Sunday left me with an empty bottle so it seemed to be well received there too!!<br /><br />COG</div>
