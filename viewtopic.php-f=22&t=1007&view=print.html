				<div class="content">This is a <a href="http://www.just-drinks.com/news/bourbon-booming-as-scotch-whisky-withers_id102802.aspx?lk=dm" class="postlink">headline from just-drinks.com</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Bourbon sales are going from strength-to-strength in the UK as consumers expand their brown spirits repertoire at the expense of Scotch whisky, according to new figures.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The rest of the article is behind a paywall but what would you say is going on here? Do the volume Scotch brands not mix as well as bourbon? Or is it just down to marketing? I have the impression that I see plenty of Jameson and Jack Daniels ads but very few Johnnie Walker or Chivas Regal ads, say (can't remember any at all, in fact).</div>

				<div class="content">True, I've often wondered if the main Scotch brands are really following a boutique marketing push strategy, versus the mass-marketing plan that Jameson in particular seems to adopt. The international sales volumes would certainly back up the theory. Of course it could all just be down to quality...... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Here in the US, there seems to be more bourbon advertising on radio and TV, while the print media seems to lean more toward scotch. The magazines for the most part aim for a higher class audience, while the electgronic media bourbon ads are mixed in with beer and auto ads.<br /><br />Apparently, scotch is for a more refined taste.<br /><br />Also, ads for Irish whiskey are rare here.</div>

				<div class="content">In hot spots in English cities I would imagine Scotch whould have the old man vibe while bourbon has the excitement of an exotic sector of the whisk(e)y family. And as eluded to the Mixed drinks sector definately favours the sweeter whiskeys so Bourbon wins there also and that is what Jameson also has built a lot of it's following on in the States. <br /><br />Not sure if that is the reason but my guess ...</div>

				<div class="content">Right, perhaps the volume sellers expect to miss every second generation of drinker. Right now they have the young folk in Asia for their whiskey and they are focusing on their vodka brands for the UK hip crowd. In 10, 15 years it might swap around.</div>

				<div class="content">Although bourbon can be found country-wide in the US, it is still sort of a regional favorite in the southeastern parts. Bourbon is traditionally a southern drink, and you can't make a mint julep without it. Jack Daniel's follows this same general image as well; more popular in the south.<br /><br />Scotch isn't really regional here, it's popular most everywhere.<br /><br />As posted above, scotch is more a &quot;mature&quot; drink, and bourbon seems to be aimed at the younger adult market.</div>

				<div class="content">I live in Bourbon Country (Central Kentucky). Bourbon is king. But with Louisville being a mild melting pot, there is a small and prominant community of loyal Scotch and Irish whiskey enthusiasts. I don't think there is a huge push for Scotch here, but more and more early middle age males in the city are turning to Scotch and irish whiskey for a more refined drink.</div>

				<div class="content">Here in North Carolina I hardly ever see any ads for Scotch. For Irish Whiskey I see Jameson ads all the time, but that is the only Irish Whiskey that you will ever hear about. Most liquor stores around here only sell Jameson, and maybe Bushmills, but other then that, nothing. Lucky for me the one around the corner from my house also sells Midleton, Power, Redbreast, as well as a few others.</div>
