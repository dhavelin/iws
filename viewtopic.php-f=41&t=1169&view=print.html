				<div class="content">I have an unopened bottle of &quot;JJ&amp;S Extra Special Liqueur Dublin Whiskey John Jameson and Son distilled and bottled by john jameson and son, ltd&quot;. It has a black label that says &quot;every drop sold is over twelve years old&quot; with two men carrying barrels.  The bottom of the bottle has a circle with W 599 at the top, followed by more numbers/letters.  There is a serial number printed on the back of the label, which begins M 517...  Not a collector or anything, I just don't want to toss something that might have value to someone.</div>

				<div class="content">This will have a value of some sort but to help us we really need a picture. Failing that click on my IrishWhiskeychaser banner in my signature to go to my site and view the Jameson page to see if you can find a similar bottle and link it here then through the URL tab when your posting a reply. I have a Jameson Extra Special listed near the bottom of the page.</div>

				<div class="content">It looks almost exactly like the hexagonal - the only exception being there is no Italian (?) across the top or side of the main label.  It was purchased at the duty free in Shannon Airport, apparently, as it has a label to that effect on the back, bottom.  Labels are in better shape than the one in the photo you've posted, IMO.  Can I insert photos in the forum?</div>
