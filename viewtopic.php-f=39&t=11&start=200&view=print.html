				<div class="content">Hello, I'm Kathy and I live at the Giant's Causeway, about 2 miles away from the Bushmills Distillery....so you can probably guess why I like Whiskey! To be honest, the only whiskey I drink is Bushmills but I would love to understand more about other brands.  I've just found out about this society so hopefully this will be a big first step towards that.  I have lived in London and in other parts of the UK, and have recently just moved back, but I have always been a proud advocate of Irish whiskey!  I'd love to organise a tasting in this area, so will try to round up a few other likeminded friends!</div>

It's great to have someone on the forum who can keep an eye on Bushmills for us, tell us what they are up to <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />With luck, we'll bring the society up for a trip to Bushmills some day.

				<div class="content">Hi all.<br />Firstly let me introduce myself. My name is Brendan and I am from &quot;up north&quot;, from the town of Larne.<br />Been into whiskey for many years and am now starting to collect. Have been to 3 of our 4 distilleries here<br />and at least a dozen in Scotland. Recommend the distillery tasting in Bushmills, especially if you get Robert.<br />Collection numbers over 100 bottles and counting. Still looking for bottles of Bushmills 1608 Reserve.<br />And thebreff, my late father worked for Gilbey's so could be interested in that, and Redbreast is superb.<br /><br />Cheers all.</div>

				<div class="content">Dia duit, my name is Michael O'Connor, from Newport RI ( The States )  I am a lover of all things Irish and especially Uisce Beatha!  Great Forum.  Also great bit of history pertaining to Irish whiskey, very accurate!  My first Irish whiskey experience was having a sip here and there of my fathers Jameson when I was a wee one.  It has been with me a long time and As Irish whiskey grew so did I.  It is a wonderous time for Irish whiskey, and hope more distelleries will come on line in Ireland.  The further recognition of Pot still whiskey is beyond well deserved and about time.  Red breast is an unbeleivable whiskey and can't wait to taste the new Pot still whiskey's as Powers, Middleton, and the famous Green spot if that is possible.  It is fun to watch as Irish whiskey makes the climb to the top again as it should be.<br /><br />slainte,<br /><br />Micheal O Conchuir</div>

My wife is an Irish Step dancer so with them dancing<br />at different pubs I was introduced properly to Irish whiskey lol. We'll be in Ireland for vacation beginging of next year so <br />I can't wait to see where it all started. Even though many posts are obviously about Irish whiskey, the insight others have on other<br />types of whiskey has enlightened me and made my humble collection a nice one. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

I'm a reasonably new starter in the world of whisky, and am currently trying to work my way through some qualifications with a view to obtaining a career in the trade. I really enjoy peaty whiskies but really enjoy the light expressions some Irish whiskies have to offer!<br /><br />I have soooooo much to learn and hopefully I can do this partly by joining in on discussions on this forum. Hopefully I wont annoy too many people by asking silly questions related to the industry either!</div>
