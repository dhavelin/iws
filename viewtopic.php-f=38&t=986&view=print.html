Well, night really as our dramming and chatting ended at something like 4am.<br /><br />Another old friend came along too and Mrs. Malty was also well enough to join us so we had a fine dinner together followed by what can only be called &quot;an open table&quot;<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Without a shadow of a doubt the Port Ellen.<br />In fact this is the most outstanding whisk(e)y I have tried in 2010, head and shoulders above any other.<br />I don't usually score whiskies on a day to day basis, but if I did this would be 92-93 which is a great score as I'm rather conservative in my scoring.<br /><br />It's a single cask Port Ellen bottled by &quot;Old Bothwell&quot;, cask No.2039 and what made it special was the variety of flavours and nuances which I have never previously found in the PEs that I tried.<br />I'm planning to put this into my Dram-atics &quot;Advent-urous&quot; series on Christmas Day and into my Port Ellen tasting notes sometime next week.<br /><br />My thanks to Oliver who brought this one along as something special with which to celebrate our good news.</div>
