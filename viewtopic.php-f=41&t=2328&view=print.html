				<div class="content">That's a great looking bottle Lynn.<br /><br />It looks pre 60's but I'm not sure. Later ones had a different neck label I think. The condition is excellent, looks like it just rolled of the production line. Where was it stored? Is the fill level high?(has any seeped out)<br /><br />Can you post a picture with the label only. I can't zoom in and read it clearly. It may have some markers or tell tale signs that would determine the age better.</div>

				<div class="content">This bottle was stored in a kitchen cupboard at my parents house for years.  My Dad believes my great uncle gave it to him for doing some plumbing work at his house, many years ago.  It is unopened and filled to where the bottle neck begins.  Again, any information is greatly appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">This is a US bottling as if you look at the Label is says 86 proof (American)<br /><br />I'd give this a wide estimate and is possibly worth â‚¬1-200 over this side of hte pond. However I see you are state side and I fear you may only be looking at $100 and that is if you can sell it over there.<br /><br />We have an American Chapter so maybe contact Rich via this link and he may be able to assist you in selling.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://america.irishwhiskeysociety.com/contact">http://america.irishwhiskeysociety.com/contact</a><!-- m --></div>
