				<div class="content">The Whisky Exchange is a good spot. I remember going to a place called Milroys years ago. You can get addresses on the net. <br /><br />Lots of good pubs too. <br /><br />2 purchases:<br /><br />Redbreast Cask Strength,<br />Tyrconnell 10 year old Medriera  finish. I only tried this recently myself and was very impressed.</div>

				<div class="content">If travelling through Dublin I'd pick up a Tullamore Phoenix, a cask strength whiskey but very very nice.<br /><br />There are thousands of choices from the <a href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/customerservice-contact-shop.aspx" class="postlink">Whisky Exchange</a> and if you go in there don't be shy and ask for help they will be very glad to assist you to buy 2 bottles.<br /><br />Middle of the road scotch whiskys which are not peated try something like<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-8844.aspx">http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-8844.aspx</a><!-- m --><br /><br />or <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-1814.aspx">http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-1814.aspx</a><!-- m -->   (This is a really under rated whiskey as I reckon it is ignored by hardened single malt fans but this is a beautiful easy drinking whiskey and as far as I remember has a really light touch of peat which you would barely notice.)<br /><br />For an entry into peat try Bowmore.<br /><br />But seriously have a chat with so guys in the retail out let and I'm sure they will give you a few samples to try.</div>
