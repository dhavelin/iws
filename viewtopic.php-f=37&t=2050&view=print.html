				<div class="content">Has the society ever tried sourcing bottles to open for sample purposes.<br /><br />Eg: discuss with distilleries and major retailers re obtaining bottles for cheaper prices, bottling into 5cl samples and selling to its members on a no profit or small society profit basis so as to cover costs of unsold stock etc.<br /><br />I think from a members point of you or at least i know from my point of view i would be happy to see society make a profit and i enjoy ability to sample expensive whiskies pre splashing out and buying them.<br /><br />From retailer / distilleries point of view its plain and simple effective advertising for new releases which certainly would lead to sales on good quality whiskey!<br /><br />Just a thought and may well be a reason why its off the cards!</div>

				<div class="content">Just seen this post. A good idea but more suited to a shop I believe. Masters Of Malt and The Celtic Whiskey Club do it already. <br /><br />I guess that what we do at tastings. We get to taste some unusual whiskeys. We often get to try so rare and expensive ones too. <br />I tried the old Powers pot still at a tasting and later sourced a bottle for myself. I've also ended up buying Dungourney 64 and Green Spot 10 &amp;12 following tastings. <br /><br />We're often first to try distillery releases such as the recent Pot Stills. I know lots of members buy the bottle later and discuss them on the forum, eg Redbreast 21. This is great for the industry. I know I generally check out newer whiskeys online and get great info about them. <br /><br />Your based near Cork I believe. I know Liam Murray has set up a charter there and they have had tastings. <br /><br />It may help if the committee put up more info about this.</div>
