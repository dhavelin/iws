				<div class="content">No I'm not - I've been in all night but I thought this might be a companion to &quot;I'm the only one here&quot;. Those of you who are out for the night can come in and tell those of us who haven't what you've been up to.<br /><br />And I think we can all agree that anyone who posts on this topic can be given a certain amount of latitude - after all it's like texting after a few pints - we something say things we don't really mean. At least here they'll all be in one place and we'll know not to take them seriously!</div>

				<div class="content">Was watching the embarrassing spectacle we call &quot;4th of July / Independence Day&quot; over here, our 234th borthday, as it were.<br /><br />Yet another American excuse to overdo it. Drink until you are sick, or worse, set off fireworks so you burn your fingers and hands, plug up the highways and beaches. <br /><br />The good things include all the cookouts and the pro fireworks shows in many of the towns. The down side is how stupid people become with a 4-day holiday weekend.<br /><br />I work most holidays and weekends. I don't understand the concept of &quot;holiday&quot;. What is that, anyway?</div>
