				<div class="content">Hi Everyone,<br />I attended the Riedel Glassware/wood finish tasting on Thursday night in Against the Grain. It was a great success. The whiskey was presented knowledegbly and entertainingly as always by Michael Lawlor from the Celtic Whiskey Shop. The Riedel Glassware was presented by John Hinckley who flew over from England especially to present the talk. The whiskies sampled on the night were as follows, Tyrconnell single malt, Tyrconnell Port Cask, Tyrconnell Anima Negra, Royal Lochnagar single malt, Royal Lochnagar distillers edition (muscat cask), Clynelish single malt, Clynelish distillers edition and Greenspot. The aim of the night was to compare and contrast the way whiskey tastes from the Riedel Glassware in comparison to the Glencairn glass we normally taste from. The three glasses featured were a port glass, a funnel top wine glass and a single malt glass. It was absolutely astounding the different nose, flavours and finishes that came through from the different glasses. Example, Tyrconnell Anima Negra was amazing from the wine glass. The wine finish really came through with all the lovely spicy dark fruits but became much sweeter and sugary in the malt glass. Under Johns instruction we poured the whiskies into each glass in turn in order to establish which glass suited each whiskey. The Royal Lochnagar distillers edition was beautiful in the port glass, really rich and caramel. All in all it was a highly informative and entertaining evening. If an opportunity should arise in the future to attend an evening with John I would highly recommend it. It has made me look at glassware in a whole new light. Slainte, Rachel.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Rachel,<br />Interesting research.<br />I found some glass in a thrift shop recently, they are lovely for tasting too. I remember them being used in bars years ago and always liked them. <br />I wish bars would have better whiskey glasses than the normal tumbler.<br />I attach a photo of the glass i mentioned.</div>

				<div class="content">Thrift shops are great hunting grounds for , I got some vintage Creme de Menthe glasses in a charity shop for 50 cent each. you know the ones with the lovely emerald green stems. I remember those glasses you like using as being the main glass used in my local pub in Newtown years ago. Not any more though, wish I'd got some myself. I agree with you about bars needing a better selection of glasses to choose from, although lets face it most of them are still working on their whiskey selection !<br />Cheers,<br />Rachel</div>
