				<div class="content">There was at least 3 Midleton 30yos bottled.<br /><br />One was from a 1969 cask released in time for the Millennium, I think. Not sure how many bottled of this was released.<br /><br />One was single release of 1973 whiskey from at least 2 casks of which I know cask No 41421 &amp; No 41422 which is a release of 1/800.<br /><br />What would be a good price ... god only knows. Fairly rare and the reseller retail price in Celtic Whiskey Shop is €2,500<br /><br /><a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/MIdleton_193-z-product-product-20-context-brand-page-1.htm" class="postlink">See here</a><br /><br />So you'll have to find it on the open market to get it for less than that but they are hard to come by ...</div>

				<div class="content">Ally has the 1969 there too. The price is €2750 to my knowledge. I guess it's rare now. I recall them getting less than €1000 a few years back.<br />The 1973 is a special creature but the price is still crazy although it was never cheap. I have a copy of a PDF from Irish Distillers from April 2008 where it was priced at €4000. It also had the 20th Anniversary Midleton for just under €5000.</div>
