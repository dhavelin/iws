				<div class="content">Pleas submit your Society Logo ideas.<br /><br />We are looking for something that is not too complicated or intricate which can be used for branding etc.<br /><br />So get your thinking caps and let the creative juices flow  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />If you are not much good at creating graphics like me just do a sketch.<br /><br />After that you can scan your image then save a copy as .jpg or something similar.<br /><br />Set up an account in a free picture hosting site. Upload you picture and it will give you an IMG link that you can use to post on here.<br /><br />I use photobucket but there are plenty more I think frapper is another well-known one. A quick google will find them.<br /><br />Look forward to seeing your ideas.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Willie JJ wrote:</cite>Is there a problem with the three stills implying triple distillation David?</div></blockquote><br />Just that whenever I tell someone I like Irish whiskey they often say something like &quot;Oh, I don't know much about it, but it's triple-distilled, right, whereas Scotch is double-distilled?&quot; IDL has had great success in putting over that line, that Irish whiskey is smoother, because it's triple-distilled.<br /><br />But one of the society's aims is the spreading of knowledge about Irish whiskey so my question is should we put the myth on the logo?<br /><br />Also, IDL hasn't been very nice to Cooley and the harping on about triple-distillation is part of that.<br /><br />I'm just posing the question. I'm not sure what I think myself. It's a very nice logo.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with the triple distillation issue also but that is only a small thing and we can change accordingly.<br /><br />We could just say that the 3 stills represent the 3 distilleries Bushmills, Cooley &amp; Midleton.Or instead of stills have barrels.<br /><br />However we have to take into consideration of the new distillery under development which looks like a real runner, so maybe 4 would be better.<br /><br />Other than that I'd have no problem with it.<br /><br />I like the cladagh idea too but  we'd need to work on it ... it is a good interesting idea which would be quite unique.<br /><br />In relation to my design it is actually quite easy to reproduce. I have been onto Glencairn, Polo shirt embroiders and badge makers and they all say it would be easy to do and require no extra tooling than on what is thought to be a more simple design.<br /><br />But we need more ideas ....</div>

				<div class="content">I concur that the logo should include a graphic/reference that is synonomous with Irish Whiskey. If the Scots have the term ' single malt' associated with them then the first question that should be addressed with this issue is   what specific terms define Irish Whiskey....Is the 'pot still' reference more Irish than not?</div>
