				<div class="content">Hi all,<br />I mentioned in my introduction that I am of Irish descent but now residing in Norway. I have two friends here that have decided to indulge themselves by purchasing a barrel of whiskey that they then wish to have bottled and labelled for distribution to friends and family. There are several Scottish distilleries that offer this service but I am unable to find one in Ireland. I know that Bushmills allowed customers to buy a millennium barrel – but it appears to have been a ‘once in a lifetime’ chance that has now passed us by. <br />If a barrel can indeed be purchased, they would like to travel to Ireland, visit the distillery and see the sights for a week or so. I’ve been offered paid passage to accompany them as a guide – and am therefore very keen to make this happen…<br />Is this something the society can assist me with? <br />Any feedback would be gratefully appreciated.<br /><br />Regards<br />Aidan</div>

				<div class="content">First update...<br />I've had a good look through the website and familiarised myself with the Founding Fathers concept. <br />I've 'signed up' on the Dingle Founding Fathers website and perused the prospectus. <br />My friends thought that Dingle's small size and location at the very western edge of Europe added an 'exotic' appeal and we are going ahead as planned. <br />The concept is one owner / one cask, but I emailed the distillery and there is no problem for a group of friends to share ownership.<br />That pretty much settled it for us - we're off salmon fishing next week and will have to agree on a name for our cask...</div>

				<div class="content">Congratulations on your decision.  Keep us informed on how it goes for you.<br /><br />Also, try time your visit around the last Thursday of a month and then you and your friends can join us for a tasting event, we're always keen to see new faces, especially those who enjoy their whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">All booked and ready to go. We're visiting the distillery mid September so unfortunately won't be able to join in a society evening on this occasion I'm afraid. Appreciate the invitation and will no doubt be making the journey over again - perhaps next time we'll manage to meet up...  <br />Really looking forward to our trip and intend to post details and updates here, but wonder if one of the site administrators could perhaps move this thread away from the society forum to the whiskey forum where it now belongs.</div>
