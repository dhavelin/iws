				<div class="content">99% sure the Celtic Whiskey Shop on Dawson Street have this currently, or had it in stock very recently. Can't remember how much they were selling it for but if you contact them they should be able to tell you.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah they sell the modern version of it, but I'm nearly certain I saw this one in there recently, they sell collectable/rare whiskies too. The picture you have shows the measurements in mililitres and not fluid ounces so that narrow's down the age a little.<br /><br />I want to say it was priced about 120 euro when I seen it, but I just can't quite remember.</div>

				<div class="content">You'll find it hard to find much on this unless you have access to news paper archives where adds are the best way to date these past bottlings accurately.<br /><br />Not 100% sure of the date on this myself but I sure one of the lads will be able to narrow it down for you I'm but guessing this is probably 1970's to 1980's. <br /><br />If it is 70's value circa €150 if it is one of the last 1980's Gilbeys version it may not be the best and a value of €80 would be closer to the mark.<br /><br />Basically when Jameson ended their supply of Whiskey to Gilbeys in 1971 they had to rely on their maturing stocks for their last batches which contained some old whiskey. It is tought the last batches were around the mid eighties and the famous 12yo contained whiskies over 20years old. This may sound great but the problem was that alot of this old whiskey had over matured in the cask and basically was not that great. <br /><br />IDL took over the brand in 1986 but did not re-intorduce it till 1991 with the label we pretty much have today.<br /><br />Hopefully it is an earlier bottle though and you can maximise the value.<br /><br />Give it a bit of time and I'm sure someone will be able to date it better for you.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm afraid the one you have is the final release which came out in late 1980/1981.<br /><br />This is the version that contains the older whiskies and has quite a woody taste after spending too long in the barrel.<br /><br />In terms of value as it is not as desirable by connoisseurs and with few collectors around I think €100-€120 is an upper end valuation.<br /><br />Regards</div>

				<div class="content">Thanx a million for your help,I just got home from a long day of work.So I hope I did'nt come across as an unappreciative one post wonder.This has been<br />an eye opening experience for me.I'd never really contemplated the degree of interest,volume of vintages and rarities in Whiskey.The value of the bottle<br />I was given(by a family member) is not really that important to me.It's more just a case of me being like &quot;a dog with a bone&quot;,since I could not find anything<br />anywhere in relation to this bottle.So you have put my mind at ease,cheers <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
