Interestingly the cork in your pictures has the imprint of the word 'distilled' as far as i can make out suggesting the cork has been in place for a considerable period. Therefore with regard to the contents we are looking at either a bottle that was refilled (possible) or the publican who filled the bottle used sub standard/cheap or even diluted Irish with foreign whiskey at the time of bottling (also very possible). However based on your comments and experience with older bottlings (this is indeed likely to be 1960s), it is likely the bottle may not contain all original cork distilleries whiskey. Interested in further comments on your tasting thoughts.<br /><br />Regards TWB</div>

				<div class="content">There just might be another reason.Got a similar bottle from an old Cork pub some years <br />back.

				<div class="content">Raven,<br /><br />Thank you for the below reply!! Very interesting to myself as i acquire d an old bottle of this from an elderly lady in the midlands! Her husband had the bottle with many years and never drank so held onto it with another jameson whish i also acquired. The sheer method of how i acquired it i believed the bottle could not be a fake!<br /><br />Very interesting reading and my bottle is in every single way identical to the one in above pictures and will hopefully upload pics of my purchases soon.<br /><br />Regards</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Danny,<br /><br />Yeah I think faking is a lot more trouble than it is worth. Only ever heard of it in regards <br />to suspicions of a couple of bottles of Allman's in the past. When the Irish pub craze started <br />in the early 1990's fakes were made for shelves in those old style bars but anybody reasonable <br />would spot them straight away as they were not meant to deceive collectors but rather to create <br />a certain vintage atmosphere. When bars closed etc.in the recession certain 'leakage' of their <br />furniture and contents could have occurred and attempts made by latterday 'Lovejoys' to sell them <br />on as being something that they are not. It's a game of pass the parcel after that <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <br /><br />Now in the Scotch industry it was quite a different matter where in the early 2000's a racket emerged<br />where even 'The Macallan' museum was caught out big time. All the bottles involved were very rare <br />Scotches which had been bought at Auction for figures not under £7,000 ---- amounts worth forging for<br />and not the type of money that Irish Whiskies even rare ones can achieve. Excellent article on the subject<br />at the time in 'the Sunday Times' 22/8/2004. 'The Macallan' called in paper experts at the time and Whisky <br />experts to discover that most of the bottles under question and their labels were from the correct period but <br />the whisky was vintage 1980's. Were there any prosecutions  you might well ask ????  NO !</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not finding pot still notes in this as a sample again, but it is very smoky.  It is a nice whisky, but not anywhere what I expected.  It's be interesting to compare the contents of more than one bottle.  There is an astringent note that might be a nod to old pot still, but I am far from convinced.</div>

				<div class="content">I tried some of this, albeit from a bottle that had a bit of sediment and evaporation. I didn't notice smoke, I don't think, but it was very weak and watery, like you get from bottles with little in them left for a long time. I might have some left somewhere.</div>

The main reason the majority of Irish whiskey over the centuries is unpeated is not because they did not us peat as many did but because they used closed kilns. Basically a method where the fires heated the drying air in seperated vents and only hot air dried the malt as opposed to hot smoke and air. <br /><br />However it is not to say they did not source a batch of pleated malt (as thought to have been used in Hewetts) or there was a mix up in production. If there is a SPS hit off it and a smokey hit off it ...<br /><br />Sounds very interesting though and indeed a mystery. Keep us posted on further thoughts.</div>
