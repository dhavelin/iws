I am a collector, and enjoyer of all spirits.  I have an extensive Bourbon collection.  I've recently come to really appreciate Irish whiskey. <br /><br />I currently have a decent pile of Irish whiskey, but I am looking to go deeper......<br /><br />If there are any collectors that would like to trade for Bourbon, Im your huckleberry.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I will most certainly bother anyone that can get me whiskey.  It appears that a lot of Irish Whisky does not get released to the US.  I will most certainly be looking for a Mule to ship it to me.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Cheers Everyone.....</div>

				<div class="content">Hello All - New poster here.  I'm from Rhode Island - small state on east coast of USA.  I am posting with a very specific request, but look forward to sharing more information and other conversations soon.  <br /><br />I'm a member of the Celtic Whiskey Club and received  a number of anonymous samples for last years Irish Whiskey Awards.  They came in sample bottles with code numbers. It was a large group and I did not get through all of them, so some friends and I are planning a little St. Pats tasting for tonight.  Trouble is, I CAN'T FIND MY LIST (or any other) that identifies the samples.  If anyone else was involved with the awards and has a list, I'd love to get it.  Maybe post it here or I can send my email address.<br /><br />Slainte!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all. <br /><br />Quick intro,  I'm from Ireland and only recently got into whiskey properly (where I don't mix it with crap). Used to just drink the standard bar whiskey in Ireland,  Regular jameson,  paddy,  powers,  teachers. All mostly fire and little or no taste. <br /><br />Then My other half got me a bottle of lagavulin as a gift and I couldn't believe whiskey could taste so good. <br /><br />Since then I've been on a sampling rampage and discovered green spot,  and jameson select reserve black barrel which could be the nicest drink ever. <br /><br />Looking forward to some advice on this forum from people infinitely more seasoned than myself.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome to the Forum. <br /><br />The Jameson Black Barrel is sweet stuff. <br />I'm a big fan of Redbreast, Powers John's Lane and Yellow spot. Well worth spoiling yourself now and again. <br /><br />There are some great Scotches, bourbon &amp; other out there too. I noticed even the small supermarket are stocking a better choice of whiskeys. <br /><br />Enjoy the sampling. If your in Dublin or Cork the Society do regular tastings that are worth trying.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the welcome, Good Whiskey Hunting.<br />I drink most single malts from Scotland, and like many, but have favourites in Campbeltown, Islay and Northern Highlands. <br />Among the irish whiskeys, I must say that single pot stills, Redbreast is the one I like best.<br />I drank a fair bit of Powers gold label in the 70s and liked it a lot. Then I didn't taste it for many years and what I got then was the crafted version at 43,2%. You may disagree, but I think I preferred the old version. Has the flavour changed much over the years?<br />Scottish single malt favourites: Lagavulin, Longrow, Clynelish, Glenfarclas and Aberlour.</div>

The same goes for most Whiskeys. <br /><br />If you like pot stills like Redbreast you should try Powers John's Lane. It's a 12 Pot Still that was introduced a couple of years ago and is excellent. <br /><br />As IWC says you'll find most of us here like other Whiskeys/whiskies too.

This generosity I shall take advantage of and follow your advice given in 2012 to a Belgian woman making vouchers for pubs and drinks for her partner. <br /> <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic.php-f=22&amp;t=1732.html">viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=1732</a><!-- l --><br />Has there been many changes since then in the recommendations, or can I still follow that advice?<br />As I said earlier I drank much irish whiskey in my time in Ireland, but only in the last 10 years got interested in the taste aspect of the water of life, as opposed to the effect when at uni. For the last 2-3 years I have also started taking a new liking to irish whiskey.<br />Teeling 21yo silver bottling is very good. Is it Bushmills too? (like the 26yo and 30yo)<br />PJL shall be tested, but it is not sold here in Norway. The dutyfree allowance have before been filled with Redbreast, 12yo, CS and 21yo. The 15yo have been drunk when in Ireland.<br />On my list of what to try this year is PLJ, green and yellow spot, Writers tears and Kilbeggan.</div>

				<div class="content">Gidday from New Zealand,<br /><br />I had the pleasure of living and working in Ireland for 10 years, during that time on a visit to the Celtic Whiskey Shop...more out of curiosity than purpose Paul (I believe he's since retired) introduced me to Whiskey. Not the mix it with coke I was more familiar with but real proper amazing tasting nectar.<br /><br />From then on I sampled and collected. Many were indulged in during evening where the world was put right  <img src="images/smilies/drunken_smilie1.gif" alt=":drunk:" title="Drunk" /> and a good few hitched a ride with me on my return home to New Zealand. Years passed and my collection languished in a shipping box whilst we renovated an old house, as this has neared completion I have finally built a display cabinet for them and my interest in them is renewed.<br /><br />Of course I have still brought and sampled the odd bottle here; thankfully many great Irish Whiskeys are now available on this side of the planet.<br /><br />I hope to learn more about whiskeys, maybe share my collection (feedback on it would be most welcome ofc) and get ideas of which whiskeys to sample or add to the collection.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Phil</div>
