				<div class="content">Just going through some boxes and found I had a few Bushmills &amp; Paddy's from the 70's. I would not imagine these are anything special I was intrigued by two and their abv statements.<br /><br />One of the Bushmills is stated at 40.5% Vol which I thought quite odd.<br /><br />The other was a Paddy, German Import. Where the stated abv is 43GL ????<br /><br />Anybody know what the GL stands for ????</div>

PV = nRT, don't ye know. <br /><br />Most importantly, Boyle was Irish, although I'm not at all sure he was fond of the place.</div>
