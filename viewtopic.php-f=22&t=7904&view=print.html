				<div class="content">I think the Signature is great whiskey. It was released at the same time as the Redbreast 21. It got lost in the shadows. <br /><br />If you can get 3 swallow release it's an entry level Pot Still. Great value bang for your buck. <br /><br />If you've a chance to get a Redbreast Lustau, you'll be well impressed I believe. It gives a different side to the Pot Still experience.</div>

Rich and Spicy.<br /><br />The Signature is closer to the current regular powers blended style although also a PPS. Sweet and smooth but good for the price.</div>
