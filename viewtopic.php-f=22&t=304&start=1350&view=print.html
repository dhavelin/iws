				<div class="content">Last night a &quot;widget can&quot; of Kilkenny and two large pours of Redbreast 12.  This bottle has now been open two years (I drink slow...not an indicator of a bottle lacking in quality) and it seems like the bottle is getting better with every pour!!  I'll be transferring the last 1/4 bottle to a smaller (200 mL) bottle to save it a little longer.  <br /><br />Even though it's only a 40% abv bottle, adding a little water brought out a batch of citrus zest in the nose/palate that was not present without the water...simply amazing stuff.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Ok, I live in Albuquerque New Mexico in the heart of the desert southwest USA. Many years ago i was introduced to GreenSpot Irish by a young Irish programmer who worked for me and brought me back a bottle. Since then I have had to be happy grabbing a bottle here and there when I am in Europe. All of a sudden I fount it on the shelf in my favorite liquor store and at a price 40% less than I paid in France last year. I am shocked and trying to determine if there will now be a steady supply in the US or should I stock up. I thought that Mitchell only bottled and distributed in limited quantities for the Irish market??????</div>

				<div class="content">Hi and welcome. No need to stock up as there should be a steady supply reaching you. Mitchell's have the distribution rights in Ireland. Pernod Ricard/Irish Distillers are supplying outside. <br /><br />You may be lucky and find a Yellow Spot. Powers John's lane 12 year old is another worth trying if you can get your hands on it.</div>

I was just about to hit below 50 open bottles and I'm on the way up again.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> <br /><br />In the last while I've opened up a new Redbreast 15yo, Jameson 18yo and my 2 newest purchases Laga 16yo and Johnnie Walkers Spice Road.<br /><br />The Lagavulin is a nice return to an old friend for me after not enjoying my previous bottle which was a good while back, but possibly me and not the Laga back then.<br /><br />I also could not resist trying the JW Spice Road from their Explorers Club collection which is basicallly a Travel retail special edition (I think)<br /><br />The JW turned out to be a nice surprise. It is not hugely spicey but there is a light woody spiceness to it. However it really has a full rich complex taste priofile and very drinkable too.<br /><br />Well worth picking up and I fear I will fly through this bottle  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'm trying 2 different Bushmills originals. One current and the other is a 70's bottle( 1784 on the label). <br /><br />It's amazing the difference. The older one has lots more character IMHO. I'm surprised, I really thought the newer one would be better <br /><br />The standard bottle was changed too many times over the years. They don't keep older bottles to try out by the looks of things. <br /><br />I've an old bottle of Powers to test soon.</div>

				<div class="content">Last weekend I travelled to the Washington DC/Baltimore area to visit a good friend.  As always, he was very generous with offering pours from his large cabinet (it also worked out well as he is trying to close out a bunch of open bottles and samples... <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> )<br /><br />Amongst a varied group of whiskies and other spirits, I had a couple of pours of Bushmills 21.  Damn, that stuff is amazing (it would be interesting to see if they bumped it up a bit from 40%, though)!  I had gone down with the intention of purchasing Ardbeg Uigedail, and this stuff almost changed my plans.  Ultimately, I got the Oogie and a bottle of Evan Williams Bottled in Bond bourbon for about the same price as the Bushmills.  Whenever I can get back to the DC area, the Bushmills 21 will definitely be coming back with me (along with the PJL 12, noted below).  <br /><br />My friend did pick up bottles of Powers John Lane 12 and John L. Sullivan The Ten Count in a shop in Baltimore as he realized that he was shy in the Irish portion of his collection.  He had been looking for the Ten Count for quite a while, and I think that I maaaay have influenced his decision to add the PJL 12 (he had not intended to buy anything at all) when I stated the unanimous response to my post on this forum about what I should bring back from Ireland (another place I still very much hope to travel to someday).  A wonderful whisky weekend all around!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif" alt="bd)" title="Cheers" /></div>
