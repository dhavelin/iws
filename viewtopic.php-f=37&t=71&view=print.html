				<div class="content">Ally posed this question at the Glenglassaugh/Irishman tasting on April 16. Bowes is less expensive (€12.50 each) but The Fitzwilliam (€22.50) is less cramped.<br /><br />[I realise this is not strictly a society poll but I reckon those with an opinion will most likely be Dublin-based society members.]</div>

				<div class="content">Food and price aside I've gone for the Fitzwilliam.<br /><br /><br />As a venue I feel the The Fitzwilliam rooms are far better for tasting than the funtion room in Bowes. <br /><br />Main reason is the rooms in the Fitzwilliam are more odour neutral. They are also more relaxed and nice surrounds in my opinion of course  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Also remember that we are expected to buy a couple of drinks in Bowes so the cheap room is a false economy. However that probably would not apply for Ally's tastings.</div>

				<div class="content">Given just the two options, I voted for the Fitzwilliam purely because I think Bowes Bar, while the staff were very welcoming and have a fantastic whiskey bar,the venue itself is getting a little small for the numbers that are developing.<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">yes, you are right, we have looked for other places, so next year we may be in a slightly bigger room <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />but suggestions are welcome for new location, criteria; easy access(bus, dart etc), free room (or cheap), may be a good whiskey bar</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Zoltan, have you come across any places that do their rooms for free? Be interesting if we could do a similar deal to Bowes and pass our custom around. Getting to use different locations may increase awareness also.</div>
