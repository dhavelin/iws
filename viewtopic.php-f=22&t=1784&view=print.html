				<div class="content">I've just returned from the fantastic Islay trip organised by Ally Alpine from The Celtic Whiskey Shop. If it happens again in the future I recommend getting on to it. Quite appart from the craic, the stunning scenery, the gorgeous food and wonderful company we got to taste some really epic whisky. Lagavulin 30 year old has ruined me forever. Although given that it costs £1000 a bootle I'll have to get over myself ! The generosity shown on Jura knew no bounds. In my opinion the Cabernet Savignon finish was sublime. In terms of knowledge and vivacity Vicky Stephens from Laphroaig was outstanding. She opened up a whole new world of how to taste cask strength. Take a small amount of water in your mouth, the same amount of whisky, let it mix and heat in your mouth, delicious. A whole new array of flavours. The Lagavulin manager was definitely the most fun, Michael Lawlor and Ciaran have been baptised with Lagavulin. Not the 30 year old I hasten to add ! Ally looked after our every need from start to finish. As  I said before if you get a chance to go in future do ! 10 distilleries in 4 days, magnificent whiskey and bonhomie. I can say no more,<br />Slainte,<br />Rachel.</div>

				<div class="content">Wow!! Sounds awesome Rachel...thanks for making a Canadian drool.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /><br /><br />Edit to add:  Just tried the 'sip some CS whiskey with some water already in mouth' method with some Bookers Small Batch bourbon just now...alcohol bite definitely gone and a chocolate covered salty peanut with caramel note (think of an Oh Henry! chocolate bar, if you have been to Canada before...are they available in Europe?) that caused me to fall in love with this bottle in the first place was very prevalent with this method of tasting.  Thanks for the tip!!</div>

				<div class="content">Well I do love chocolate and no I have not tried an Oh Henry, but if you like chocolate get the darkest one you can find and have it with Compass Box Orangerie Whisky. It is SUBLIME ! Let the chocolate melt in the mouth a little first, trust me. <br />Slainte,<br />Rachel.</div>

				<div class="content">I went there some years ago in January and enjoyed some outstanding storms with my whisky.  I loved it so much I took SWMBO there for a portion of our honeymoon four years ago.  She fell in love with it too.

				<div class="content">well spotted Luke, I might get you to edit for me in future. Although maybe we should invent a bootle, bigger than a flagon but smaller than a cask ?</div>
