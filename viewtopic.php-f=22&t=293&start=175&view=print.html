I've just ordered a Lagavulin 12yo Sherry Cask from the whiskey exchange.<br /><br />Before that it was another 2 bottles of Redbreast 15. Can't help myself.</div>

It's available at very few local pubs so I was glad to see it on the shelf at a state-owned store.  <br /><br />Their prices are very hit and miss ... on one hand they have bargains like Powers 12yr ($35) but on the other they have Redbreast 12yr ($55 USD -- can be found very easily elsewhere for $40 USD).</div>
