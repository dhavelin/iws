				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />I paid a visit to the Whisky Exchange in Vinopolis, London recently. Nice store with some fantastic whiskies. Mostly Scotch but had a decent number of noteable Irish releases. Thanks to Matt I had the opportunity to taste one of the new Port Askaig expressions - the 17yo, and, I also sampled the Ardbeg 'Still Young' straight from their onsite Hogshead. I'm glad I tasted in that order because the Ardbeg was rocketfuel! Very nice rocketfuel though!<br /><br />Don't ask me how, but I also got in an interview with a Japanese Whiskey programme - naturally I plugged the IWS!!<br /><br />Word of advice to anyone thinking of heading over - call ahead! They have a massive inventory listed on their website, not all of which is immediatly available in store. With an advance call then can have it positioned in store for you when you get there.<br /><br />All the best,<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, Sukhinder is well known in collectors circles and is a keen collector himself, Started out simple from a warehouse and when the collectors market got going he was in the right place at the right time and is now has probably one of the top selections of whisk(e)y in Europe.</div>
