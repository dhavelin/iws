				<div class="content">hopefully someone out there can help me.<br /><br />my husband enjoys collecting and drinking irish whiskey.<br /><br />i seen two bottles of rare whiskey on sale in the usa for a good price.<br /><br />i thought a good christmas present for him.<br /><br />of course the only problem how to get them to ireland.<br /><br />i spoke to dhl and they said no problem, they would collect and deliver. so i paid for the bottles. however, when i went to book it in with dhl, they then said they could not collect them without fda approval for the store, proformas invoices etc. however the store did not have any of these, so dhl would not collect. not very professional of dhl - should have told me  this in the first place <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />i then contacted customs and excise in ireland. they told me if i got a friend or family member to post to me in ireland as a gift, i could get them into ireland and pay any vat or excise when it is in ireland.however my friend in the usa, went to 2 post offices and both would not post to ireland as it was liquids and whiskey.<br /><br />now whiskey still in u.s.a.<br /><br />any suggestions?</div>

				<div class="content">Firstly welcome to the forum.<br /><br />Sounds like you have a lucky husband. If you are in a position I would love to know what you have got him but if it is a case that he could possibly look here don't post if he can connect you to your user name.#<br /><br /><br />Anyway you problem.<br /><br />It is true that the USPS will not send whiskey through their system. <br /><br />You have 2 possiblities get your friend to go back to DHL and see if they will do if for them however there may well be the same problem.<br /><br />The other one is a case of bending the truth.<br /><br />What you need to do is get your friend to go back to USPS ... but what they have to do is not be so brutally honest. When they are filling out the declaration label they need to be slightly economical with the truth. <br /><br />Never directly say A Bottle of whiskey. Terms like &quot;WHiskey Decanter&quot; can have a totally different connotation in peoples minds and does not instantly raise suspicion. You friend will not be telling a lie as a bottle of whiskey can just as easily be described as a whiskey decanter but it sounds like that there is not whiskey involved. ANd lead crystal decanters can be heavy  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Others may have other ideas ... but wish you the best of luck ... it would be a travesty for your husband to miss out on such a treat</div>

				<div class="content">Not to give away trade secrets but &quot;vintage glass decanter&quot;  &quot;collectible container&quot; or &quot;glass receptacle&quot; (haven't used this one) are all legitimate descriptions.<br /><br />I am happy to pay customs and excise at my end when required to do so. <br /><br />Sounds like an opportunity for a competition for the best description....</div>
