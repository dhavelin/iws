				<div class="content">This is a limited edition of 95 Volumes and individually numbered and signed by Barry Walsh, grandson of Maurice Walshe. Barry himself is a retired IDl master blender. Unfortunately this is currently only available to Card Carrying (i.e.fully paid) members of the Irish Whiskey Society. Until such time as that the membership sales have petered out. This will probably mean that it will not be made available to IWS forum members and other non members for a while yet.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

Probably then only obtainable on ebay at immense prices.<br />Looking forward to a Bladnoch (inter al) on Thursday.<br />Cheers</div>
