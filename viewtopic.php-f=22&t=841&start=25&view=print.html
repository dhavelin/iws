				<div class="content">Yes Iain stated PPM levels are pretty meaningless in a way and as you say there are many factors to how the peat comes through (or does not for that matter).<br /><br />Size and shape of stills have a lot to do with it as does wood quality and the age of the malt (In general the peat ppm levels fall with age).  <br /><br />In relation to the PPM level in the spirit not being calculated I was wrong and I obviously did not logically think about it too long. It can be calculated by chemists but I don't think the Distilleries bother and prefer just to stick to the PPM peat levels of the original malt.<br /><br />So this got me thinking is there any facts and figures out there and I did a few googles.<br /><br />I came across an interesting article about research done on PPM phenol levels (in regards topeat) in malt and new spirit and then whisky.<br /><br />Laphroaig uses malt circa 35-40ppm but the new make is measured at about 25ppm (71.4-62.5% of original levels). <br />Yet Ardbeg uses a malt with 50ppm peat levels and new make is surprisingly only 17-24ppm (34-48%)  (this rings true for me as I find Laph more peaty in general)<br />This is in stark contrast to Bruichladdich Octomore (First batch) which had a Malt peat PPM level of 80.5 yet the New make was only 29.6ppm (36.7%).<br />Batch 2 was 167ppm with spirit comanding a level of 46.4ppm (27.8%) so as you can see even the same distillery cannot maintain it's ratio's.<br /><br />In the case of Laphroaig and age the phenol levels drops to 8-10ppm after 10years in wood and down to 6ppm at 30years. <br /><br />But even facts like these I don't think tell the full story ... the actual spirit it self, maturation and cask type can play a big part on the peat effect. A whiskey may have an equally high PPM level with another whiskey but not neccessairly show the same effect. Laphroaig and Lagavulin have similar if not identical ppm levels but reveal the peat on the palate in totally different ways. We all know the 16yo Laga but I've tasted but yet the 18yo Laph seem to have a more agressive peatiness eventhough it is older. A very interesting topic and one I'd love to learn more about. <br /><br />Hopefully Turf Mór is a cracking peat monster  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

But Briuchladdich are the masters of propaganda in the Whisky world and proclaimed with great aplom their 80ppm level on the malt but ignored the fact that the spirit ended up only 29.6ppm. Further they sell Octomore at what I gather is only around a 5yo for a stagering 80-100 sterling  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  Yet the original (Batch 1) as an end product is no more peated that a laphroig. They obviously learned from their mistakes though and have had to up the PPM levels substantially to actually make it more peaty ... I suppose fair play for creating the hype and cashing in on it but I won't be buying their over priced 5yo whisky  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  .</div>

Seems unlikely, I know. But my notes have the use of 58ppm malt no earlier than 2007. 2010 is much earlier than we were expecting the high ppm to come out.</div>

Just guestimations on my part but it would be interesting if they are going to stick with the 3-4yo age or going to build the age up over time. In the case of finishes they very rarely go over 6 months anyway so the 3 month finishing time is not unusual. In this case however sherry maybe used to round off a bit of the rawness yet retaining the potency of such a young whiskey. I have actually not tasted this so as I say just try to logcally work out why it is being done so. <br /><br />In the case of Kilbeggan it may simply be wanting to have a genuine product from the distillery to be available with the advent of the complete distillery up and running and in this case I would be very surprised if they did not build up the age over time. Personally I thought the Kilbeggan Disitllery Malt had a few flaws and could possibly be down to bottling too young but still well worth the experience and not bad by any means.</div>

				<div class="content">It was an eyeopener of a dram for me. I'm not a smokey whiskey fan in general, but I really thought that the added 'kick' of peat made the Turf Mor. I think the standard Connemara is a little more sweet than smokey, and can betray its youthfulness. But the added peat really made it a much more assertive dram. Very impressive, and it would be fascinating to see how it ages.<br /><br />Even more so, I'd love them to release that Bog Oak experiment. That is something utterly unique, and it had tremendous balance between the sweet spirit, the peat and that intriguing spiciness from the bog oak. I'd love to sit over two or three drams of it and really get into it. On initial tasting, it seemed unusually complex and interesting.</div>
