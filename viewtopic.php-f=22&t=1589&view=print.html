				<div class="content">If the cropped Bottle on welcome page is anything to go by it is a new addition to the spot family.<br /><br />The early days line up was ...<br /><br />Greenspot 5yo, Bluespot 7yo, Yellowspot 12yo, Redspot 15yo<br /><br />But then the green was a 10yo for a long while.<br /><br /><br />As Greenspot is possibly regressing back to the Blue's age maybe they will come out with a Blue at 10yo.<br /><br />I'd personally love it to be a 10yo as there seems to be a glut of 12yo's from IDL out there. However I suppose to neatly slot it into a category they could well stay with the 12yo. So the big question will be Blue or Yellow and what age statement.<br /><br />Anyway I'll be happy no matter what it is  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">Leo's tweet is pretty spot on: &quot;Lemon &amp; Orange zest, red apple skins, wood notes &amp; a treacle sweetness&quot;. I thought it was most comparable in effect to the Redbreast Cask Strength among the SPS range (we were trying them again tonight). It doesn't hide the fortified wine at all but where the Redbreast takes it too far, the sherry/malaga doesn't outpace the whiskey in the Yellow Spot. The effect is the zest Leo mentions. It's a good whiskey. I need to spend more time with it.</div>

It's definitely a &quot;would buy&quot; which means I already like it a lot. In the SPS range, I might not place it ahead of Powers John's Lane, my favourite, but I might place it ahead of Green Spot, my second favourite. It's distinctive enough that it's hard to make a snap decision on a small sample.</div>

				<div class="content">Opened a bottle of this last night ...<br /><br />Some initial but very basic thoughts.<br /><br />Wonderful sweet fruity nose on this. The big sherry fruitiness dominates but more from soft fruits like apricots and peach instead of the usual dried fruit cake mix of traditional oloroso. So I'm guessing the Malaga casks are showing their extra fruity sweetness here. Lovely there is no hiding from it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Again the taste is as big as the nose and in the same vein but with a sweet honey or syrup base . Very silky and coats the mouth but not cloying. However there is a grand big blast of wood spice in there which to me is the ideal off set to balance the sweetness.<br /><br />The finish starts to dry quickly and even a touch of bitter but some of the sweetness repeats in diminishing waves in and out ... if there is a flaw in this whiskey it may be here. Flaw may be the wrong word but the finish does not live up to the expectation that the nose and taste deliver, maybe it is too delicate to what preceded it. I expected it be long and rewarding but it seems a bit half hearted in comparison to the rest of the whiskey. <br /><br /><br />Over all this is a wonderful flavourful whiskey and a perfect after dinner whiskey and despite my reservations on the finish is well worth the effort. Maybe my expectations were built up too much and are over riding what I should be getting from the finish and I definitely need to return to it. But be in no way reserved in getting a bottle of this if you can as it is worth the trouble. A wonder experience and already looking forward to having another asap ....</div>
