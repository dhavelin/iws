				<div class="content">Is the 2009 the rarest of the post 2000 Midletons ?? This was <br />the year that they caught up so to speak as they always ran <br />a year behind i.e. the 2007 was launched at Christmas 2008 <br />and so on. In 2010 they caught up and launched two the 2009 <br />and the 2010 but my information at the time was that only a <br />limited quantity of the 2009 actually hit the streets !! I certainly <br />have never seen a bottle in WhiskyAuction !<br /><br />Anyone out there with a thought on the subject  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /></div>

				<div class="content">Not sure what Dobaroji is on about there, reckon he/ she could be one of those 'trolls' who pop up now and again. You'd have to ask yourself though, what is the point of doing what they do?<br /><br />Anyway, back to MVR 2009. I am probably wasting my time but if anyone has, or knows someone who has, a bottle of this that may be for sale (or appealing swap) please PM me.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Anjinsan</div>

				<div class="content">Don't have a bottle but it was the 2009 midleton that stopped me collecting them on a year by year basis. It is rare in Ireland because the 2008 didnt sell very well so had a lot of stock left over into 2010 (possibly in some places 2011). So they shipped a serious whack of it to China and only sold 2009 vintage for about 3 months in late 2010. At least that's the story I heard!</div>

If a year was not selling well they would hold off the release of the newer year by a month or so.<br /><br />However they basically re-alligned the release schedule. Up to 2009 the Midleton was released mainly in time for the Christmas market (circa October I believe) which is when majority of premium whiskey is sold in Ireland and around the world, up to 90% of Premium Irish whiskey sales happen on the run up to Christmas I believe.<br /><br />However in the advent of premium whiskey becoming more accessed by the masses it was seen as not ideal having a Annual release with the year on it being released near the end of the calender year. Therefore 2009 was released as per previous years near the end of the year but was produced as a smaller batch as 2010 was then released early in the following year (2010 obviously) as a fairly normal batch size but it is possible that the 2010 is a slightly smaller batch from normal too but to be honest that is just a guess from me.</div>
