				<div class="content">Hello. I'm Scotty and reside in florida USA. My obscession to make  Irish whiskey came about when we discovered an un opened  bottle of old  bushmills and decided to try a bayles irish cream recipe. it was great  but we used  most of the bushmills.<br /><br /> I am a wine maker and recently a distiller of spirits. I found a recipe and a local grain supplier.  The  first  batch was a disaster because i decided to get creative--the second batch seem ok. the third batch will be fortcoming in a few weeks.<br /><br />The recipe i found  is<br /> 10 parts malted barley<br />7 parts un malted barley<br />1 part rye<br />1 part wheat<br />1 part oats.<br /><br /><br />i never tried any other ratio. i will always appreciate input.<br /> I never drink whiskey which makes evaluation even  more dificult.<br /> i am glad i found this place and hope to learn some new tricks for my next mash.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Welcome on board Scotty and much kudos to you for trying to make an Irish Whiskey. However I'm afraid you'll never succeed ... because as your based in the US you'll only ever be able to make American whiskey. Hence by jurisdiction you fail  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />However I know what your getting at, you want to make an Irish Style whiskey ...<br /><br />I don't have all the answers but can where you may have a few draw backs ...<br /><br />There are several factors to consider ...<br /><br />In the mashing process the larger grains like oats are used more for filtration than taste. Basically when the mash settles ofter being cooked the heavier oats fall to the bottom first and once everything settles the smaller particles of the milled grain (i.e. undisolved flour) is filtered by the heavier oars. It is undesirable to have a wash heavy in light particles as they can burn in the distilation process thus affecting the taste dramatically.<br /><br />Further, distillation requires a bit of practice to get your cuts right. You are looking for the most pure spirit from the distilation, this is called the heart or middle flow of your distilation. The first part and the last part of any distilation are again considered undesirable as the start and end of the distillation contain very heavy fusel oils and even toxins. This is done by all distillers and only practice can tell you when the good stuff flows and stops. This is above any knowledge I'd have but I think you can tell by the alcohol precentage volume.<br /><br />Lastly the spirit produced is only a 1/3 of the story ... you then need to cask it in quality oak to create a great whiskey. There is a saying that says ... a quality spirit in bad wood makes bad whiskey but average spirit in good wood can make a good whiskey.</div>

				<div class="content">ok on only irish style whiskey. I can easily live with that fact.<br />   I am very familiar with making  cuts in distilling. i have  an instrument or two in adition to my  nose to help me.

I  understand that  Irish whiskeys  are/were  tripple distilled in a pot style still--i did this in my last attempt.<br /><br /> I'm wondering if you could elaborate on the grain mix a  bit-- i do sparge and have necessary equipment to handle the  mashing in just about any maner  suggested.<br /><br /> I am here  hoping to get   suggestion and corrections in adition any method that other folks use.<br /><br />ill post a pic of my last attempt at making &quot;((IRISH/AMERICAN WHISKEY))<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The  grains<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/beer%20making/mashingsetup002.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />one of  my mashing pots<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/beer%20making/mashingsetup003.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />18 gallons of fermenting mash<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/beer%20making/fermentingunderlock.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This is one of  my stills  but not the pot still<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/beer%20making/distiller001.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />our irish cream label<br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/Wine%20Labels/FitzgeraldsIrishCreamlabel.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />one of our whiskey labels<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/Wine%20Labels/Fitzgeralds.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />this is a poor picture  but the  label we use  now  for fitzgeralds<br /><br /><img src="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d199/slowpoke59ds/beer%20making/test2001.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />we chose the name fitzgeralds  becaue my lady friends daughter  married a fitzgerald an we like his family very  much. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Yes you may want to rethink your labeling as you could be leaving yourself open to serious liable... I'm not even sure whether you can even do it privately. Basically you are making a claim that if seen in a light that may cast Irish Whiskey in a negative way you could have a few corporates on your case. Pernod Ricard took an Irish Whiskey to task over their label design as they thought it was similar to Jameson so the precedent is there for litigation.<br /><br />Anyway I wish you the best of luck in your indevour, looks like a great little set up you have there, wish we could do stuff like that over here but unfortunately not. I have a quick question for you ... how much spirit do you reckon you'll get from say a 5 gallon Demi John of Wash? Would not have tought it would be much?<br /><br />In regards to maturation ... I would not have thought chipping would not be enough, definately consider a good but pre used cask. Fresh oak has a habbit of overpowering a whiskey which is why Irish and scotch only use preused Bourbon or wine casks. You could just buy some small casks and season them yourself with cheap bourbon or sherry or some other strong wine. <br /><br /><br />... in regards to ratios chat <a href="viewtopic.php-f=22&amp;t=242.html" class="postlink">HERE</a></div>

				<div class="content">The EU won't permit any whiskey made outside of Ireland to be marketed or sold as Irish whiskey.<br />It's not a case of a distiller here getting their nose out of joint. The EU won't allow it, and will demand that the US authorities remove the product from market and destroy it. It's like a Napa winery marketing their fizzy white as champagne. It might be made to the methode champenoise, it might even be better than most champagne, but if it isn't produced in the Champagne region of France, you can't call it champagne anywhere in the world.<br />I'd suggest changing 'Irish Cream' to 'Cream liqueur' and if you're genuinely going with a pure pot still mashbill, just call it 'Pure Pot Still Whiskey'.<br />Again, you might want to be quick though, as the EU is currently considering a denomination petition and is expected to rule that only whiskey made in Ireland can be called 'Pure Pot Still' at some point next year.</div>

				<div class="content">we dont sell any of our products-- i just  give it to friends.<br /><br />the yield fron 5 gallons depends on the potential % of alcohol  the wash indicates. using gallons that contain 128 fl ounces we get 128X5=640 ounces-- a typical all grain wash will yield 8%potential alcohol if  done  very carefully. 8% of 640 ounces is 51.2 ounces of 160 proof or 102 ounces of 80 proof. this is about 80% of a gallon or a  bit over 2 qts-- after diluting to 40% and re distilling two more times we dont end up with  much.<br /><br /> then remove 50ml of foreshots -  the heads and tails--yeesh  not  much whiskey..<br /><br /> then if you want irish whiskey you need to distill 2  more times.<br /><br /> this is why i make 3-- 7 gallon  jugs of wash.<br />I had a canadian friend  bring  me imperial gallon  demijons which hold 7 usa gallons,<br /><br /> I think after i cleared and distilled those 21 gallons of wash. i had about 5 or 6  350 ml bottles.<br /><br /><br />i would  very  much like to here  more opinions about  my labels.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Sorry to be picky about this, but if you want Irish whiskey, actually all you need to do is distill it in Ireland and then leave it here in oak for three years.<br />It can't be called Irish whiskey if you make it elsewhere. It's a two way street. We can't make bourbon here either, or rather, we could make something very like bourbon, but we'd be hauled through the courts if it appeared anywhere with a label saying 'bourbon' on it.<br />It would be especially unfortunate if you ended up facing a big legal bill since you're not seeking to profit and are only distilling for yourself and friends, so I'd definitely rethink the description.<br />Apart from the description, I think your labels look great.</div>

				<div class="content">I wouldn't want to speculate on hypotheticals.<br />I think it's great that Scotty is having a go at making a small batch PPS, and is keeping up appraised as to how he's proceeding, step by step.<br />I wouldn't want to see him get into any trouble because of an errant label, and it is clearly against US law to call anything Irish whiskey that wasn't made to EU standards in Ireland.<br />It might be best for Scotty to seek legal advice locally to see if there is any wriggle room like you suggest. Personally, if it were me, I wouldn't bother taking the risk. <br />I'd just call it something different. If it's only going to family and friends, you can always tell em it's an Irish style of whiskey when you give them the bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">Your recipe is probably okay ... as at the end of the day your only creating a new spirit (i.e. un-matured whiskey) which is basically only a slightly more flavoured spirit than vodka. If you feel you have too much flavour in your spirit dull it down with your own home made vodka. Basically grain whiskey is not far off vodka before it is matured anyway and is made in the same way by certain distilleries i.e. coulnm still. <br /><br />As already mentioned modern PPS is now only made up of Malted and Un-malted barley and ratios range from 60-40 through 50-50 to 40-60.<br /><br />By what you say on the wood taste sounds like this is your whole issue I can nearly guarentee is maturation.<br /><br />Maturation is where Whiskey gets the majority of it's flavour ... but you don't want the wood to be too fresh. Further I think chips are totally unsuitable for your purpose. Basically there is too much oak in contact with the whiskey. Try and picture a large cask of whiskey and the ration of contact to the oak in comparison the the contents. <br /><br />You really need to consider using seasoned casks. You could buy something like <a href="http://store.hamiltonhomebrew.com/8005ld.html" class="postlink">THIS</a>  or <a href="http://www.winevine-imports.com/american-white-oak-barrel-w-hoops-personalized" class="postlink">THIS</a><br />The only other Idea I could think of is a sinlge oak stave but whether than can be successful or not is not something I can answer. <br /><br />Sláinte</div>

Another estimate by the same author is one fifth malt, two thirds barley and the rest oats. <br /><br />Today, the don't use oats and go for around 60:40 unmalted to malted barley. The distilleries run different fermentation times too and all sorts of different things.</div>

I just asumed everyon wanted to  distill the stuff.<br /> i hang with this group of distillers  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.brewhausforum.com/index.php">http://www.brewhausforum.com/index.php</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />Naturally being a yank i dont know very  much about other countrys. sorry  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> <br /><br />well having said that i hope that i dont seem or get too bold.<br /><br /> Let me change the subject a bit now.<br /><br /> The USA is a very diferent place than the post ww2 of 50 years ago. It was not uncommon to know folks who were born in diferent countrys.<br /> i grew up in my dads store-- all sorts of accents and  totally foriegn languages were spoken  there often.<br /> at any rate, i have  many friends up north that are irish decent.KELLYS related  by marriage--ennis and isles related  by  growing up in the same town--mcloughlins just  friends for years and the list goes on. they are  waiting for me to come up with a batch of  <span style="font-weight: bold">fitzgeralds IRISH style </span>whiskey so when they visit cocoa beach this winter i can drive over and give them a taste and perhaps even allow them to smuggle a drop or to to the Mc Loughlins or the kellys.<br /> the ennis tribe comes to florida in the winter.<br /><br />   Well i just wanted to  say something about being presumptious and naturally ramble on a bit.. I guess i should confess that  my rambling is  not blarney but just italian blabbing. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">It's a pity you're a long way from the West coast, otherwise I'd have suggested trying to lay your hands on a sweet red wine cask from a winery to capture that genuine old-style Irish PPS taste.<br />But it seems like you're well on top of the mashbill. I agree with IWC, the wood might be your problem. Teabagging chips isn't going to bring about the result you want. As IWC said, laying your hands on a small oak cask and seasoning it with wine might be the best way forward. <br />Do let us know what you do and how it goes. This is a fascinating process.</div>
