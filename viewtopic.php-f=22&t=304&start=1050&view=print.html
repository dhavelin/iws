That's better, this is sublime.</div>

				<div class="content">Staying on thread 'by a thread' here, however; I'm enjoying a couple of Innis &amp; Gunn's Irish Whiskey Cask aged bottles of Scottish beer. Matured in Rare Irish Whiskey barrels, from a distillery famous for triple-distiling its' whiskey. Matured for 60 days, full of flavour, short finish and very dark. Very enjoyable!<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">A good friend of mine died this morning in a horrific car accident, leaving another friend seriously bad in hospital. In fact Ray who was the passenger and survived passed me a healthy sample of Rosebank 21 OMC just the other day. I shall raise a glass of that to his recovery in just a short while. I'll raise a glass to Nige afterwards, a good man. Heart breaking, especially to his parents who had to drive 150 miles to identify his body. The driver of the other vehicle has been arrested.<br /><br />Farewell old friend.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">On a Jameson night which does not slip off my tongue as easily as I thought...<br /><br />Started with a Jameson Gold lovely whiskey with plenty of vanilla a good easy drinker but some how my memory suggests the older version was better. Lauded by many but I had a Jameson 12 (Midleton Reserve) directly after and yes that is much better for me. Richer, creamier, fuller and of course the rich dried fruit. <br /><br />Now on Jameson 12 (1790) ... Straight away different mouth feel. Gets you in the cheeks and the old style pot still carachter is there. Gets a bit vinegary in the finish but good at the same time. Definately well worth a try if you come across it.</div>

				<div class="content">Cardhu 18 - disappointing! Sweet vanilla nose is the best bit and Cardhu not even renowned for the nose!<br /><br />Like the idea of the Jameson night. Jameson 1780 and the Small Batch have been my favourites so far. Never has the 2007 Reserve. All their whiskies are good though. Just love the standard Jameson - was the whiskey that got me into whisk(e)y as a teenager. Only came back to it in the last few years and it is like coming back home!</div>

				<div class="content">I wish I'd had a Jameson night too. I polished off a bottle of the new Jameson Gold recently and it left me wanting more. I had a Jameson select reserve earlier just to warm the body.<br /><br />I home early tonight and looked around to see what I'd have and found an old screw cap bottle of Bushmill's 10 year old Malt, so I broke the seal. I wish I hadn't. Very disappointed. <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumbdown.gif" alt=":thumbsdown:" title="Thumbs Down" /> <br />Is it me or was this stuff really that bad, I had the 16 recently and was not overly impressed either, but put it down to the Yellow Spot I was also sampling .<br /><br />I think I'll have to find something to wash its taste out of my mouth. I know there's a bottle of Jameson Marconi open that will help me sort that. If that doesn't help I'll open a Jameson 1780 as IWC recommends.</div>
