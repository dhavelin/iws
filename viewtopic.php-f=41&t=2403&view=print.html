				<div class="content">I'd expect they are worth €300-400 for a private sale. They retail much higher but shops have overheads and VAT. <br />I see some go at auction a while back for €350 including commission etc. The condition was fair too. <br /><br />If yours was one that had a Crystal cut glass included in the package those are rarer and worth a little more. All would depend on bottle condition and packaging.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you very much for that information. I have had an offer to buy my bottle but had no idea what would be a fair asking price. I have the crystal glass and the box is in fair condition so I now have an idea of what to ask for it.</div>

				<div class="content">One in the celtic whiskey shop currently for 900 but I'd not get overly excited about that but you can use it as a bargaining chip. I think GWH is pretty on the button but I'd go closer to the €400 mark as a fair price.<br /><br />Best of luck selling it.</div>
