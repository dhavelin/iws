				<div class="content">Hi all. Not sure if this has been on the forum before or not but I'm looking for a bit of help. My collection has grown to a point where it has become of significant value, both financial and sentimental. I'm just wondering if anybody here on the forum has contents insurance on their collection, and if so can they reccommend specific companies and policies. I have looked into putting my collection into one of those self storage centres, but for a collection of about 10 bottles with significant value it costs approx 550 euro for the year. Seems a bit much, but then again for piece of mind against burglaries, floods, leaks and my own clumsiness.... Any other suggestions as to how to keep my collection safe would also be greatly appreciated.<br />Thanks in advance.</div>

				<div class="content">I rang FBD years ago. Can't remember the outcome. You need it insured if it goes over a certain value, which is some percentage of the overall value of the contents of the house. Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm talking about. I split my collection between a few different places to keep the value per location down. And I hope if anything happens, they won't all go at once.</div>

				<div class="content">I am with Allianz and had no problem putting them under the house insurance.<br /><br />Basically it is just noted item under home Contents. <br /><br />So stated as a specified item (i.e. Whiskey Collection). <br /><br />Stating number of bottles and Max value for any one bottle = â‚¬x</div>
