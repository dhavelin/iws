Most other sites refer to friends or links and on mine it's a &quot;Wall of Friends&quot;;<br /><a href="http://www.whisky-emporium.com/UK/Friends-Links.htm" class="postlink">http://www.whisky-emporium.com/UK/Friends-Links.htm</a><br /><br />If irishWhiskyChaser and/or this forum would like a link I would be honoured to include tham. Just mail me the graphics / logos and I'll do the rest.<br />I do not expect or demand a reciprocal link, this really is that proverbial &quot;free lunch&quot; for you.<br /><br />If anyone else has a suitable whisk(e)y site then the same applies.<br />Malty</div>

				<div class="content">That would be fine, is there any chance you could mail it to me please, along with IWC's?<br /><br />The reason I ask for a mail is due to the latest business explosion here in Germany where firms of lawyers exist purely to trawl the internet and find sites using logos, pictures or graphics which they think may have been illegitimately 'borrowed'. They then send a mail to the website asking for proof of permission to use the graphic(s) and if none can be provided, they threaten to open a lawsuit along the lines of &quot;Pay us €xxx or we will open a lawsuit and have you fined €xxxx&quot;.<br />For this reason I keep a copy of every e-mail that I receive with the logos as this is excellent proof of permission.<br /><br />Crazy? Yes, but a 100% 'legal scam'.<br /><br />They do the same with music or film downloading and 'sharing', even though the German Government has said they won't prosecute such misdemeanours any more, lawyers are opening private lawsuits and making rather good livings out of this and not on behalf of any intellectual property owners, just for themselves!<br /><br />I recently read an article that at least one firm of lawyers in England thought this an excellent business plan and were looking to do the same there. Be careful, it may spread to Ireland too.<br /><br />You can mail either to the contact address on the Emporium, or to my private address with which I registered here.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks David, logo received and I'll try to incorporate it tonight, but certainly during tomorrow at the latest.<br /><br />If someone would like to send me IWC's logo too, I'll add it at the same time.<br />If I can make the Society logo fit into the place, I'm intending to put it in place of the Contently-Managed (CM) one directly to the right of Nonjatta where I hope it will feel at home. CM will move somewhere below, although I would like to try and sort out that next level including IWC's logo.<br />I tell you, it's a fascinating constant jigsaw puzzle that I have there  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

All I can really do is make it fit my own  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Hopefully, yours should also look something like this (yes, it is scaled down as a graphic, but you know what I mean)<br /><img src="http://www.whisky-emporium.com/Pix-pool/Screenshot04.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Edit</span><br />Oh dear, I guess some are going to have problems here  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br />IWC, I just saw the link you gave me on your site and I see a rather distorted view of my home page probably due to lower resolution than I use, or a smaller screen maybe?<br /><br />Anyway, my home page really looks like this right now;<br /><br /><img src="http://www.whisky-emporium.com/Pix-pool/Screenshot05.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Can anyone else let me know if their's are badly distorted too please.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the feedback IWC it's always much appreciated.<br /><br />I recently posted something over on WWW regarding my &quot;Dram-atics&quot; page and two people immediately asked why there were large areas of white space at certain points.<br /><br />This was something I had never encountered but after quite a bit of investigation I found it was due to the basic design of the page causing a problem only in certain environments. It took a full re-design of that page but I cured the problem to the gratitude of all concerned. In the end I was very sorry for what they previously had to put up with and had no idea this was happening. I'm nothing like a web programmer and have only the basic ability to work with FrontPage, but I do try.<br /><br />As for the couple questions in your e-mail, I'll answer privately in the next days, but generally no, things aren't so good at the moment as I'm unemployed and according to most here in Germany, unemployable too.<br /><br />Malty</div>

				<div class="content">Hi again,<br />just to let you I've jiggled my main t-note page around a little and &quot;Irish Whiskey&quot; now has its own identity and can be directly referenced or skipped to via the following address / link:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.whisky-emporium.com/UK/TastingNotes.htm#IrishWhiskey" class="postlink">http://www.whisky-emporium.com/UK/TastingNotes.htm#IrishWhiskey</a><br /><br />I'm sure you'll recognise the two pictures and hopefully as I sample more Irish whiskey the list of distilleries or brands will increase too.<br />Malty</div>
