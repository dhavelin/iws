				<h3>Proposed change to society structure - vote by 15 September</h3>

				<div class="content">It is a pity the current committee isn't sufficiently interested in or engaged with the society membership to provide information about the vote to change the structure of the Irish Whiskey Society.  A meeting was held three months ago prior to a Dublin tasting but the meeting was not initiated by the committee, it was held in response to concerns raised by some members, and the opportunity to vote on the change had to be dragged out of them.  There have been brief verbal updates at tastings in Dublin, and scant mentions in society e-mails, but in general getting information about this has been like pulling teeth. The link below mentions &quot;a document sent to you in an e-mail&quot; which I certainly have not received yet (as of 00.25 on 1 September 2017) {EDIT - e-mail now issued - see new post below].  This vote was also not mentioned at the Dublin tasting on 31 August 2017.<br /><br />Please note you have to log into the website (as a member of the IWS) rather than to the forum to be aware of this vote.  Only IWS members (rather than forum members) have a vote, which is appropriate.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/event-2631411">https://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/event-2631411</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">Yes, there was an e-mail from the committee this morning about voting for your favourite bar but they still can't be bothered communicating with the members about this.  It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase &quot;secret ballot&quot;.</div>

				<div class="content">Not sure where we are on this topic? Could the Committee perhaps give an insight into % of members that have voted at this point, etc.?<br /><br />I believe that there are still some quite important unanswered questions posed recently by at least one member, so it would be beneficial if those could be answered for the membership.<br /><br />Can the Committee highlight these questions and the relevant answers ASAP please?</div>
