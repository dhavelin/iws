That to me would seem self-evident.<br />Secondly, I really must argue again that since this is an Irish whiskey society, it is important to my mind to establish the separateness of the identity from Scotch and Scotland, and it seems to me that the Irish language is an ideal and simple way to do this.<br />According to the constitution of the state, Irish has equal if not superior legal status to English. I don't think it is overly off-putting to new members or would-be members, even those from abroad, if the society gave both languages equal precedence in terms of titling and the logo. There are numerous bodies in Ireland which provide both versions of their name in their logos and none of them seem cluttered as a result.<br />I still appreciate the work you did in bringing an image for people to peruse, but I agree with other posters that we need to see more options and choose from a wider range of ideas. I am also a little concerned that the image you presented appears to be too close to the logo of an existing whisky society for copyright comfort.</div>

				<div class="content">I should add I don't want a coat of arms. I was trying to think of an example where various symbols were incorporated into a single logo. I have a poor photocopy of the old Dublin Coopers Guild coat of arms which incorporates shamrock, barrels, coopering, horses rampant and so on. The quality is too poor to show it so I randomly selected the goldsmiths' one. There is probably a way to come up with a modern equivalent.<br /><br />It's a good point about etching and stitching. One advantage of having a stylised 'e' is that it's monochrome and can be transferred to any medium. It can also stand on its own, like the Nike swoosh, on a tie or cufflinks or whatever, that you don't want people to be &quot;reading&quot; (I'd include all clothing in that category  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> ).</div>

This uses the ogham representation of 'e' - one horizontal and four intersecting verticals.<br /><br />Again, it's simple, monochrome and modern yet it also incoporates references to Irish tradition (ogham) and Irish whiskey ('e').<br /><br />Please ignore the crudity of the drawing.
