				<div class="content">I have inherited a bottle of mulligans Irish whisky and noticed people are looking for the last bottle 4years ago<br />I am trying to work out how to put a picture here to show you this original bottle unopened.<br />I also don't know if anyone would want it.<br />This is a rounded bottle with a dark brown screw top.<br />I would like to know the history of it as it has been in an 81 year old mans possession for a long time.<br />I am unsure what to do with it or just keep it for a few years.</div>
