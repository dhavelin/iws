With Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Vinnie Jones and a whole raft of regular Italian mobster actors so there seems to be a bit of money behind it. May be worth a watch.</div>

				<div class="content">Went to see <span style="font-weight: bold">The Guard</span> last night ... Only an okay film as there is a bit too much &quot;Paddy Whackery&quot; in it but Brendan Gleeson in excellent in it and worth seeing for him alone.<br /><br />Anyway the very first scene is a speeding car with a few youths in it drinking from a bottle of Irish Whiskey, which I do believe is a bottle of Dundalgen Irish Whiskey from Lidl ... no expense spared there then but fits the profile of the lads in the car.<br /><br />Gleeson is seen pouring a whiskey later on in the film. We only see the back of the bottle but I'm nearly positive it is a bottle of Slane Castle. <br /><br />Kudos for going left of field  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>

				<div class="content">&quot;Bar Rescue&quot;, a reality show on Spike TV in the US that is similar to 'Kitchen Nightmares', featured Downey's Restaurant in Philadelphia.  Being one of many Irish pubs/bars/restaurants in Philadelphia, the emphasis on Irish whiskey and related mixed drinks was featured as a component in the turnaround of the establishment.  A quick shot of the whiskey menu showed an unspecified Tyrconnell selling for $22 for a drink!  The 10 yo Port Cask serving I had in Toronto a couple of weeks ago was only $14.  The show's host was using the Tyrconnell and its pricing as an example of how the listing of a high end, high priced drink will actually increase alcohol sales away from the 'cheap $5 shots' to the mid-range offerings of $10 - $15.<br /><br />The owner is an Italian born gentleman who is a classically trained chef who had quite clearly checked out of the business of running a restaurant, but seems to have regained the passion after admitting to the show's host that things went downhill for him after his brother had died.  Here's hoping that the momentum stemming from the re-launch continues for a while.<br /><br />Checking the restaurant's site, one of my whisky 'pet peeves' rears its ugly head, yet again...for some unknown reason the restaurant does not list a whisk(e)y menu on-line!  I have always been perplexed by this, especially when an establishment has a whisky selection beyond just the 'mixers' and (in this part of the world, at least) Glenfiddich 12 &amp; Glenlivet 12 as their single malt options.  Please restaurants/bars, be proud of, and promote, your whiskies!! &lt;mini rant now complete&gt;</div>
