				<div class="content">Just recently back from the Whisky Exchange in Vinopolis, London and travelled back through Stanstead. If anyone is passing through, the whiskey outlets have Midleton at £75 per bottle as well as a good selection of other offers. Well worth a look in my opinion.<br /><br />On another note, what do members think of the new look duty free (etc) section in Dublin Airport. Decent range of Irish whiskeys available with a nice selection usually available for tasting.<br /><br />All the best,<br />John.</div>

				<div class="content">As far as I can remember they had about 6 or so on display at around the €110 mark. Not 100% sure on that price; but it was there and there abouts. Like I said, I was surprised when I saw it and yes I would also love to have the exact figure for the remaining stock. Though stockists that I have spoken to always seem to indicate that they would be able to get their hands on it if they thought there was demand!! It's hard to know what to believe! <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>

				<div class="content">I also see that the Tullamore Dew regular is at 19.99 in various off licences here in Galway. Are we finally seeing a bit of common sense from IDL in actually doing some discounting. I'd prefer to see all prices drop 10% though and a restructuring of their price points to where the rest of the industry is at. i.e. Jameson Gold around the 50Euro mark and 18yo around the 75-85Euro mark.<br /><br /><br />P.S. O'Briens have opened a branch in Galway. I the Galway shopping Centre on the Headford road to be precise.</div>

				<div class="content">Just found a shop that beats that unbeatable price for Black Bush - the Bushmills Distillery shop!<br />They've been clearing stock with a rotating sale (that they failed to tell anyone about) up at the distillery. Before Xmas, they were selling the 16 yo at a markdown price, apparently.<br />Currently, it's the turn of Black Bush and the 1608 anniversary edition (the one with the fancy box and the crystal malt).<br />Two bottles of BB for £30 stg currently. That translates into under 17 euro, duty paid, per bottle. Worth it if you're filling the boot, but perhaps not worth driving 330 miles (Dublin-Bushmills rtn) for.<br />The deal on the 1608 is even better - currently £30 a bottle, down from £54 at the distillery. I don't think anywhere on the globe is going to beat that price, especially for a whiskey for which stocks are dwindling.<br />Normal Bush in the new bottle is actually more expensive than BB up there at the moment.<br />No price drops on the 21 yo, distillery edition or the 16 yo currently.<br />Another thing I heard is that the 1608 is actually a vatting of 12 yo to 16 yo whiskeys. Never realised there was such older stock going into it. Perhaps there wasn't initially, and they're stretching it out with some 16 yo single malt stock? I don't know.</div>
