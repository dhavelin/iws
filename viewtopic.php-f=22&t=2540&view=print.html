				<div class="content">Hi Shane,<br /><br />If your based in Dublin, I recommend you drop into the Porter House/Dingle Whiskey Bar on Nassau St. on Tuesday evenings. Fionnán O'Conner does a whiskey class. He should be available to help you. <br /><br />Best of luck and Sláinte.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the reminder, I've been once or twice to Fionnans tasting(eagerly awaiting a glass apart)<br />And as I had been working most Tuesday I've kind of forgotten about!<br /><br />I have a few books on whiskey and spirit books with a whiskey chapter(such as Tristan Stephensons curious bartender an odyssey of malt, burbon and rye, And Distilled by Joel Harrison and Neil Ridley)but I was looking for something ideally a little more bite sized! Or even a documentary!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Shane, <br />I was recently at the Whiskey academy at Midleton. Excellent it was to. Although a bit expensive for what your looking I would wager. A really good alternative could be to check out Ralfy.com and look at some of his master class vids on YouTube. I think he is probably the best, no actually he is the best, whiskey Vlogger online. Lots of reviews etc but some good tips presented really well and not too heavy.</div>
