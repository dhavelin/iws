And if so, is it a fortified wine (port/sherry type) of just a regular wine type. <br /><br />But it would not surprise me if IDL had something along those lines ... but whether we'd ever  see it is another thing  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Speak of the.......... and they release Yellow Spot, with Bourbon, Sherry and Malaga casks in the mix.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Mad or what  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  <br /><br />Who's reading who's mind I wonder.<br /><br />Myself, I'm currently having a lovely espresso in the back garden.

I think it was the last bottle of this batch.  I had a sample of this from another friend's cabinet in December, and I loved the 'fruit and nut chocolate bar' profile that just jumped right out at me.  Anybody that is a fan of sherry aged whiskey has to get this batch if they can find it!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">My dad and his wife visited on the weekend and, among other things, I enjoyed a glass of Redbreast 12, since they were the providers of said bottle, at Christmas this past year.  I added water to it for the first time to experiment...I noticed that a real creaminess came out when this was done.  Really nice!  <br /><br />To celebrate Canada Day, I enjoyed a bottle of Innis &amp; Gunn Canada Day 2012 Limited Edition ale, and Collingwood whiskey.  This is a new Canadian whiskey that has been put out by Brown Forman's Canadian Mist distillery in (strangely enough) Collingwood, Ontario, about 3 1/2 hours north of London.  It is overall a sweeter rye whiskey that is best had as an after dinner drink.  I've enjoyed it as the sweetness cancels out a more medicinal rye note that I find in most other Canadian whiskies in a similar price range.<br /><br />Being the 4th of July (and myself having ties to the US), I may adopt a 'premium' bourbon/whiskey approach later today.  I'm eyeing two or three of Booker's &quot;Small Batch&quot; bourbon, George T Stagg (2011 ed.), Old Potrero 18th Century Style Rye, Jefferson's Presidential Select 18 yo and/or Parker's Heritage Collection (4th ed.) 10 yo Wheated.  We shall see what ends up in the glass (though with four of the five being over 60% abv, <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />  they may be smaller servings!)</div>

While the Stagg definitely needs water to take off the alcohol edge, it retains a great, rich profile that includes leather, polished wood, and pipe tobacco.  A very enjoyable evening all in all.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Last night, I &quot;celebrated&quot; the discovery of a family of skunks (appears to be both parents and 4 babies) that seem to be living under our back deck at the moment, with a large drink of Bushmills Black Bush (bushy fur on mainly black skunks...sorry, I had to find a tie-in to my whisky collection somehow  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ).  Fortunately, my wife and I were unharmed, though startled when (to start the event) two babies walked across the top of our driveway at the front of the house.  We got the heck inside and noticed the family gathering in the back yard.<br /><br />At Can$37 a bottle, Black Bush may be all I can afford for the next while as it will likely run over $600 to have someone live-trap and transport the skunks away...and then to add patio stones to the base of the deck to reduce the chance of new visitors taking over the burrow under the deck.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /></div>

				<div class="content">Ditto to whiskey chaser ... trying to get the numbers of open bottles down ...<br />Sent a bottle of Yamazaki and Jim Murray's favourite, Dufftown to the green bin tonight, although the Yamazaki was killed a few weeks ago.<br />I'm down to 56 open bottles (from a peak in the 90s).  (Too) Many have been open for a number of years (oldest open since 1987!, many open since 1999/2000).<br />Tough work, but someone's got to do it ...</div>
