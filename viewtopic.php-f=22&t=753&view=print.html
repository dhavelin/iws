				<div class="content">A new one to the market in America...<br /><br /> OBN Holdings, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: OBNI) today announces the filing of the trademark for &quot;Emerald Isle Irish Whiskey,&quot; the second offering in its new beverage product line. &quot;We are pleased with the introduction of Emerald Isle,&quot; stated Roger Neal Smith, OBN Holdings President and CEO. &quot;The new product helps to begin solidifying our beverage division and provides an additional product offering for our trading company. As with our Scotch, the new trademark also adds another valuable asset to the company.&quot;<br />Emerald Isle Irish Whiskey will be distributed through Kyodo USA, OBN's wholly-owned trading company.

				<div class="content">OBN Holdings is engaged in acquisition and subsequent development of businesses worldwide. The company has interests in a diverse number of industries, including entertainment, manufacturing, technology and business services. OBN is internationally diversified with offices and subsidiaries in the United States, Hong Kong and Japan. Essentially they are a holding company with fingers in many different pies.<br /><br />Their Scotch press release from the 01st June read:<br /><br />LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwire - 06/01/10) - OBN Holdings, Inc. (Pinksheets:OBNI - News) today announces the filing of the trademark for &quot;Loch Abar Highland Scotch Whisky,&quot; its new brand of Scotch whisky. The brand will initially be offered in three forms -- blended, 12-year old premium blended and 10-year old single malt. &quot;We are thrilled about our new products,&quot; stated Roger Neal Smith, OBN Holdings President and CEO. &quot;This is the first of a number of items to be distributed under OBN controlled brands. This strategy gives us control of our products and also adds a valuable asset to the company in the form of a trademark.&quot; Loch Abar Highland Scotch Whisky will be distributed through Kyodo USA, OBN's wholly-owned trading company. The first product shipments are expected to occur during the summer of 2010.<br /><br />One very disappointing point here is why there is so much diversification on the Scotch and so little on the Irish side of the product line.</div>

				<div class="content">True enough, at face value it seems that they just want any old product with the words Irish Whiskey on it just so they can say they have a diverse range. I wonder who is producing it for them?<br />J.</div>
