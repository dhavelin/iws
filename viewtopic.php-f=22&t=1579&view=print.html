				<h3>Question: Is Blackbush dumbing down???</h3>

				<div class="content">I opened a bottle of Blackbush lately. It is one of the newly packaged ones with the fancy new Bottle.<br />Now I cut my Irish Whiskey drinking teeth on Blackbush and loved it for the fruit cake raisin &amp; spice notes.<br /><br />This one seems to be much dumbed down on what I thought it was. Is it just me and had I remembered a better whiskey or have I progressed to a stage that this whiskey is not as tasteful to my palate as it used to.  <br /><br />It is also an age old argument that a new bottling is or is not covering up something different. I personally think it is usually a gradual thing though. <br /><br />This is always a tricky question to call on when you don't have a sample of what you thought it used to taste like to compare.<br /><br />Further to my questioning, I had asked my wife one night to pour me a blind whiskey. However I could not guess what it was ... I knew it was Irish and when it turned out to be Blackbush I was perplexed  <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <br /><br />I had it again last night and it was really bugging me. Is it dumbed down or is it just me  <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> <br /><br />The nearest I had to had of another sample was a bottling for the 70's so I open her up and went for a side by side tasting.<br /><br />Is this a fair comparison I cannot really say but it was all I had to work with.<br /><br />Firstly the colour I noticed is markedly different. The 70's is much much darker and the new one is lighter. Now we could say this is a positive as there may be no use of caramel colouring (or very little) in the newer bottling but is it a sign that it is different. Even the 90's bottlings were on a colour par to the 70's bottlings so yes there is a change.<br /><br />So we get to the taste, well the side by side tasting is very black and white. The 70's bottle has all the big raisin and spice flavours (even though there is a little bitterness there too that I never go before) that I associate with Blackbush while the new version is very mellow and easy drinking. Definitely some sherry influence but I have a sneaking suspicion that is has far less sherry than it used to or possibly more grain content than it used to. <br /><br />Anybody notice this or is it just me?</div>

However 2005 would be closer to the 1970's version than it would be to the current one and there is a marked difference in my opinion. What I also found interesting was that the 2005 10yo Bushmills was virtually the same colour as the current Blackbush. While not having a spectrometer inbuilt into my failing eyes I cannot say for sure they are identical in colour but they are very close to the naked eye. So is the new 10yo a lighter colour too? well going by PR pics it would indicate yes. This actually does not mean anything and in actual fact may not necessarily be a bad thing and could mean that they are not using as much or no colouring at all which can only be a positive. I'm very tempted to open the 2005 Blackbush but having 3 of them open would be over kill. I think I'll leave it a while or maybe I could swap with someone if they have a similar bottling open.</div>
