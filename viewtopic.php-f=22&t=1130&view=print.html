				<div class="content">I'd heard about the distinction between midleton's 'heavy' vs 'lighter' styles back around the time of the society's SPS tasting with Barry Crockett but the subject seems to have come up again with the introduction of the two new SPS standard releases now. I was just wondering if anyone had any more detailed insight into how these two styles are produced in the midleton stills? Is it the heating of the stills themselves or the width of the cut taken or what? I know Midleton have a bit of an armada of stills; is it the choice of pot still employed? I remember reading on a blog somewhere about a light style, a medium style and something called mod 4. Anyway, i've been itching with curiosity about this for a while now so i thought i'd post something to the forum.</div>
