				<div class="content">'Only for Celtic Whiskey Club Members'. Sure, you mostly have only Irish Whiskey Society Members around here! When did we start advertising other club's activities anyway? Don't they have their own forums? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I think it is unfair though to insist that our members purchase another club's membership to attend events like this; especially considering that we go out of our way to allow them to advertise their whiskeys in our Society (see the September tasting details).</div>

				<div class="content">I think we promote all things whiskey, there is plenty of room for whiskey clubs of different hues in Ireland, after all Sweden I believe has over 200 whiskey clubs. so what you are really saying is you'd like to see another PPS tasting.</div>

				<div class="content">Maybe they'd let you go if you hadn't club membership. <br /><br />Sure the Irish whiskey society is about promoting Irish whiskey. I didn't know there was any sort of competition.</div>

				<div class="content">No, what I'm really saying is that I'd like to see reciprocation of the goodwill shown by our membership! Where we facilitate others, so should we also be facilitated! Just making a small but yet important point, or do you regard it as a 'People's Front of Judea' Vs the 'Judean People's Front' type of situation?!<br /><br />Fair point well made John, however I can't help but believe that if that concession was available to IWS members that they would have mentioned it? I'm sure it will be a good night though.</div>

				<div class="content">I really don't think we should be thinking of IWS and CWC as being in competition - they're very different things. IWS is not a commercial venture, CWC is - I'm in both by the way, never get to go to either tastings, but I don't expect CWC operate in the same way - as long as it's good value then I've no problem at all with what restrictions CWC have. And besides there are members only society events too.</div>
