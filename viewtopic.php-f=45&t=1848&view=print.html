				<div class="content">H.S. Perrse's Galway Whisky distilled at Nun's Island Distillery <br /><br />I decided to break down and open my bottle from Nun's island because the cork was in danger of falling through.  I have saved a half bottle for another day.  For those who don't know the distillery on Nun's island in Galway closed in 1913, it seems the man who inherited it wanted to raise horses in England rather than distil in the West of Ireland.  It supplied it's whisky to both the house of commons and royal court so it was probably considered to be of very good quality.  The label of my bottle was heavily damaged, however, I have compared it with a seven year old miniature and a full sized bottle of the four year old.  I have found it has much more in common with the seven.  I know that it was offered in standard bottles at four, seven, and ten years old.  The taste of the whisky tends to support it being either seven or ten years old.  Here is my first set of notes:<br /><br />Colour: Bright Gold<br /><br />Nose: porridge, sweet, wood glue,polished oak, particle board, dust, grist, old library (wood, glue, very faintly musty) subdued nose that opens with time, a hint of perfume<br /><br />Body: beads quickly on side of glass, legs move quickly, velvety mouth feel<br /><br />Palate: mint, alcoholic bite, pine, vegetal, herbicide, garden shed, black pepper, floral, perfumed <br /><br />Finish: big wintergreen, herbicide, porridge, icing sugar, perfumed, lasting bitter herbicide, chlorine <br /><br />Comments: Opened up to reveal a beautiful old-fashioned pot still whisky.  The whisky was intact and came alive after half an hour.  It has much in common with Bow St. PPS, but is softer and less aggressive despite sharing similar flavours.  The noticeable mint makes me wonder if any rye was included in the mash bill. <br /><br />90 pts (preliminary)<br /><br /><a href="http://ceallaighgirl.smugmug.com/Other/Whisky-Porn/26668700_xB94rs#!i=2282575445&amp;k=p5dt4Vf" class="postlink">http://ceallaighgirl.smugmug.com/Other/Whisky-Porn/26668700_xB94rs#!i=2282575445&amp;k=p5dt4Vf</a></div>

				<div class="content">So the final verdict is very much like the above.<br /><br />Nose: Vinyl, porridge, glue, kerosene, mint, dust, oak, pepper, faint floral perfume<br /><br />Palate: mint, vegital, kerosene, perfume, cinnamon, garden shed, vinyl, pepper, herbicide, vanilla,<br /><br />Finish: Kerosene, floral, wintergreen, vanilla, vegital, herbicide, chlorine as it fades <br /><br /><br />I'll leave the score at 90, but that might include a bonus point or two for being so old.  Age aside it is bloody good and highly drinkable.  It is the sort of bottle that might not live until morning.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <br /><br />As an aside I have identified the bottle manufacturer as Nuttall &amp; Company, St. Helens, Lancashire.  The company merged with some others to form United Glass in 1913</div>

				<div class="content">Excellent Joel and thanks for sharing. Some great investigations going on at your end too. I've always played with learning up on the bottle manufacturers and codes but have never got around to it but would make life much easier for dating purposes. A huge area though.</div>

I've been spending more and more time researching the bottles as it is a gold mine of info.</div>
