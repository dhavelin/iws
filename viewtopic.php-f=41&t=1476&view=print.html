				<div class="content">That first price is a retail price and you will not realise that on the open market.<br /><br />Original selling price on this was £300 IR pounds which equated to €381 Euro when we changed over to the Euro. And yes it did retail at €381 Euro at that stage  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />Over the years it has been subject to Irish Distillers Ltd price increases which has more to do with elevating the it to a premium level and that is fair enough.<br /><br />However as this was available at a much lower cost up to 4 or 5 years ago iris Whiskey collectors will not offer anywhere near the current retail price. It seems to be averaging out at €800 on the open market. However another issue you have is that you are in Oz and this could well be another barrier to you selling it at even that open market price I suggested. <br /><br />Best of luck selling though.</div>

But you said it was a 25yo.<br /><br />I know there was a special bottling done for an American delegation to visited but can't remember the details of the age of the bottle but it was cask 48795. Was it that???<br /><br />So get a picture up and we can check it out for you. I'm intrigued now  <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /></div>

				<div class="content">That's the 25year old released in 1999 I would say, but it is distilled in 1973 as it was bottled before it reached 26 years of age i.e. bottled early in 1999, hope that clarifies it. Unless of course the picture shows differently.</div>

				<div class="content">I though you couldn't either. The seller has a business name, but I still say they'd need a disclaimer or something.<br />I've seen allot or whiskey and spirits on it recently.</div>
