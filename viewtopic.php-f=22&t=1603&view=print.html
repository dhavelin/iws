Not great for four days of golf.<br /><br />What does the runner up get ???? A glass of Bushmills <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">Says Colum Egan:<br /><br />&quot;As part of our landmark sponsorship, I’m offering a unique prize for the golfer that wins the tournament. As well as offering the ‘Freedom of the Distillery’, I am also going to place a bottle containing a special blend of Bushmills Irish Whiskey in a bespoke cabinet, handmade from oak that is used in the whiskey making process. That bottle will have pride-of-place right here at the distillery and it will only ever be opened by the winner himself.&quot;<br /><br />Your mission, IWC, when you get up to the gig, is to get us a sample of the &quot;special blend&quot;.</div>
