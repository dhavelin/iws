				<div class="content">Bus looks like the best option. There is one leaving Belfast at 5 which gets into Busaras station around 7.30 and then coming back I would probably have to get the 11PM bus as far as Banbridge/Sprucefield to be home for 1.30 or so.<br />Other option would be to stay over in a hostel or something and leave early in the morning for work.<br />The things we do for whiskey <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">I've done it from Galway a couple times. Arriving no probs but heading home is a bit of a chanlange, Bus to Galway 11pm arive 1.30 then Taxi home which would not get me home till after 2am. Okay to do once in a while but can be quite tiring so I usually stay over if I can.<br /><br />Travelling on the day still makes it worth it though  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />   <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
