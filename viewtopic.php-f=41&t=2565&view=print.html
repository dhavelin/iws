				<div class="content">This bottle was just gifted to me by my grandfather-in-law. Has anyone come across these or have any additional information? The only info I can find on it is &quot;An old bottle of Jameson's from the 1970s, this was produced at the old Bow Street distillery before the move to Midleton in 1975&quot;<br /><br />He received it as a gift back in the 70's and its been on a shelf in his pantry since then... still sealed, and brimming full. He &quot;is'nt much of a whiskey dinker&quot; and I told him it looked to be collectible and that he should keep it but its now on my liquor shelf. <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9YXITsR.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">It is indeed a 1970's 12 years old. Distilled in the old Bow Street Distillery. There's a 15 year old version of this blend too. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.whiskyantique.com/ireland-whiskey__2/jameson-special-old-irish-whiskey-12-yo-75-cl-40_ID20967.html" class="postlink">Here's</a> a link to a shop selling one. This is retail prices so private sales are less of course. <br /><br />You can expect between â‚¬120-170 at auction but check charges and commission. Condition and boxes are another thing that gets better prices too. <br /><br />I like those bottles a lot and noticed the ran with the basic design for ages.</div>
