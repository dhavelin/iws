				<div class="content">I'm not 100% sure this is the one, but a few years ago the guys from Cooley got a rare bottle of Preston's Malt and poured the bottle into a cask of Cooley. They marketed it as something like Prestons single malt. However, since they poured a bottle of whiskey from another distillery into it, it technically wasn't a single malt...<br /><br />Maybe this is something different entirely, though. <br /><br />They have a bottle of Prestons 10 for sale in the Celtic Whiskey Shop at the moment, a half bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">See ...<br /><br /><a href="http://homepage.eircom.net/~prestondrogheda/" class="postlink">Prestons Single Malt</a><br /><br />This was bottled for the Millennium and originally retailed for Â£78 IR pounds.<br /><br />The claims on the site are a bit fanciful as Whiskey had not been distilled in Drogheada  since the 19th century. Prestons on the other hand are thought to have been bonders and not distillers and it is likely that the whiskey put into this cask bottling (330bottles) of Peated Cooley malt was probably bog standard Jameson blend.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes these guys bought a cask of Single Malt (aka Tyrconnell) from Cooley and chucked in a bottle of Preston's (Malt/PPS/Blend???). This process yielded 330 bottles which they marketed (cashed in) for the millennium. So technically it is a blend (329 parts malt to 1 part Preston's). So it was bottled in 1999 and since Cooley first produced malt around 1989, the malt is very likely to be less than 10 years old. In terms of value, it is more of a curiousity than anything else... difficult to put a value on it, but it would not have broad appeal other than to a few collectors.</div>

				<div class="content">If you open the picture in MS Paint and then just reduce the size of the picture using &quot;stretch&quot;, it will reduce the file size. There are probably much handier ways too.</div>
