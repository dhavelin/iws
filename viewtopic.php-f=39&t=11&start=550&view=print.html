				<div class="content">Whiskey! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /><br />Whats my budget?!?<br /><br />I suspect, I'd be fairly average in my tastes. Big fan of many irish whiskeys. most of the middle range stuff. <br /><br />Top end....I love the RedBreast 21yo. I know its pricy, but flavour wise I'd take it over the recent Midleton VR's. or any of the &quot;premium&quot; scotches like JW Blue. <br />I have lots of Single Casks/Special editions, but haven't opened them yet - so who knows whats in there!<br /><br />I'm only starting my Scotch exploration but partial to various Glendronach's at the moment. If I fancy drinking some turf - then Lagavulin 16.<br />Not a huge fan of the US stuff - but no doubt that will change with experience!<br /><br />But my &quot;go tos&quot; would be RedBreast 12 or Greenspot (and their various sherry cask variants!) - These are the ones that hooked me on this nectar!</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome ZeClaw, you've set yourself up nice with your go too drinks already. Just a matter of experimenting from here on it and see what suits you. You may buy a whiskey which you don't overly like but that lets you know what you like and as you go forward you may come back and see a different side to something you thought you didn't like and go ahh now I get it. Enjoy the journey  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Good Day All!<br /><br />Nice little site you have here, and I'm glad to see one that is specifically focus on Irish whisky !!!<br /><br />My name is Walter Hurst, and I am not much of a whisky connoisseur in any major way (though I like a <br />tot or two almost daily), but I have been a &quot;bottle buff&quot; with regards to collecting, dating &amp; appraising <br />older bottle of spirits for nearly 10 years now... I can be found on several similar whisky sites helping <br />others to get answer to their bottle questions: <span style="font-style: italic">Just websearch for me as &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">wchurst</span>&quot; &amp; the any words<br />like &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">Whisky</span>&quot;/&quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">Whiskey</span>&quot; and you will see what I mean.</span>   <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br />I'm hoping to see some interesting older bottles here, and to lending a hand with questions regarding<br />dating/age &amp; valuation... So drag out those photos, and let's see what answer we can find for you!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Walter C Hurst<br />Santa Rosa, CA USA</div>

				<div class="content">Hi All,<br />I'm John,<br />Compare to all here, I am just a wee budding Whiskey enthusiast. Very naive, I have been collecting Whiskey for a few years and accumulated about 30 bottles. Mind you they are Tullamore Dew as I work there.<br />I just love the smell, and the process that goes into making it. <br /><br />I'm looking to learn from the best here, as recently pricing my collection, my wife reminded me that I do not have any overly expensive or exotic bottles. Thus I guess I must learn what is collectable and what is not. <br />Thanks for accepting me to your site.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br />My name is Tony Secil from Cork.<br />I got interested in whiskey a long time ago but only recently started to collect a few moderately expensive ones and am only in my infancy as far as collecting is concerned.<br />Previously I used to drink the stuff but now I tend to buy to keep. Never know I may work my way through the collection at some stage.<br />My favourites include Bush 21 yr old, Midleton VR and Green spot. I do however drink the ordinary Jameson normally.<br />I am open to buying selling or swapping if the situation arises.<br />Looking forward to taking part.<br />Regards All,<br />Tony</div>
