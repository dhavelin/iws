				<div class="content">Hi, new to this site, not a collector at all but years back my partner was given this bottle while she worked in the midleton distillery. It's a midleton single cask, cask no 31431, matured in a second fill bourbon barell, 46%, and was used especially for enda Kenny's visit in 2012, it's in a really nice box with a little book, I've tried to add a picture but it keeps telling me file size is too big<br />Just trying to find out if it's really rare or not, valuable or not, and if it is then what's the best thing we should do with it...storage area, upright or on its side etc... <br />Any info appreciated <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">This is a rare 19yo Midleton Single Cask bottled on the 2 May 2012 for the Taoiseach's visit on the 25 May 2012.<br />Around 190 bottles were produced, single casks are rather a specialist area of collecting as they are expensive, hard to find and not produced in enough numbers to create widespread demand. That said I wouldn't part with it for less than â‚¬350, but with the right buyer/auction could go for a lot more.</div>
