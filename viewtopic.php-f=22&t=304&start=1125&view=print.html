				<div class="content">some Glenfarclas 15 and Bushmills Black Bush on Christmas Day.<br /><br />This evening I had a great tasting with my next door neighbour where we opened:<br /><br />- Pike Creek Double Barreled Canadian Whiskey (a side by side tasting of a NAS bottle that he had from several years ago, compared with a 10 yo bottle that was released last month, which I got him for Christmas).  The Pike Creek is aged in bourbon, then port barrels.  Based on the tasting, I suspect that all of the stock was distilled at the same time with the flavours/aromas that were more 'front of nose/palate' in the NAS were in the background in the 10 yo bottle, as the influence of the port barrel aging became more noticeable).<br /><br />- Signatory Clynelish 18 yo (1992-2011, two hogsheads = 771 bottles) nice floral and honey notes with peat playing a nice supporting role.  Very nice.<br />- Glenmorangie 18 yo, aged 15 years in bourbon barrels, then three in oloroso sherry barrels...a fair number of tropical/citrus fruit notes.<br />- Ardbeg Uigeadail (batch L12, 113), a much heavier profile than I remember from previous batches that I had sampled.  The smoky notes came across like charcoal at times...a seafood roast over a peat fired campfire.  This one is a bit too heavy, though I figure it will settle down a bit now that the bottle is open.</div>

				<div class="content">Having a Yellow Spot. It's been open for a while and I think has really benefited for it. <br /><br />I'm also really enjoying Bushmills these days. I always liked it, but something's really turned me on to it lately. And another one I've had recently is the 1975. It's been open for a long time and again it seems much better for it. I'll have to buy more of this. Still great value.</div>

I've only had two glasses so far and took no notes on the second.  I have noticed some similarities with Old Irish Gold 15 y.o.  The glue or vinyl notes that remind me of old church kitchens.  I really am starting to suspect that there may be some Rye in the mash bill too.  It is undeniably big old-style PPS in the finest way.  It is no wonder it was sold to the House of Commons and the court of Edward VII.  I'd put it on an equal footing to old Bow st.<br /><br />Drinking it is a bit eery when I think that not only is everyone who made it dead, but there is a very good chance the children of those who made it are dead too.  I was joking with my wife that it is product of the United Kingdom, distilled in Connaught! <br /><br />I will add to my notes once I get to know it better, I'm also having one of the malt maniacs try it to get his thoughts.</div>

				<div class="content">My Burns event last night was a dinner/whisky tasting at a local pub with a friend.  The whiskies involved were:<br /><br />- Lombard IB of Teaninich 12 yo @ 40%<br />- Hazelburn 8 yo @ 46% OB<br />- Wemyss 'Cream of Islay' Caol Ila 1996 - 2011 15 yo @ 46%, single cask (390 bottles) for the LCBO.<br /><br />The Hazelburn was the winner of the evening for the two of us (with the Wemyss a VERY close second, albeit in an apples to oranges comparison, imho).  Hazelburn is the triple distilled variant from Springbank distillery.  The triple distillation, along with the age of the bottling, allowed for a lighter mouth feel and overall flavour profile.  Rather nicely though, there are several bold aromas that come through.  Cotton candy, bubblegum, apricot, candied citrus, and caramel squares come across strongly on the nose.  These were amped up further when my friend had a 2nd glass as the session was drawing to a close.  A very enjoyable bottle that, for me, drew some parallels, especially in the sweeter notes like the cotton candy and caramel, to my experience with Jameson Gold Reserve several months ago.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
