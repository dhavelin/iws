				<div class="content">The cats out of the bag. I was talking to a source a couple of days ago and he confirmed this too. There will be a big push for Powers over the next few years. <br /><br />I'm not sure what the AVB will be here when it's released. I also was curious about whether or not the 12 year old would be continued and was told that although there are over 1 million casks in stock it may not be viable to keep producing any 12 year olds. This includes the Jameson 12.</div>

Powers has slipped in sales in Ireland. I guess they think a good way to grow sale here is grow them in the US. It's amazing how hard it is to find a SPS whiskey in a pub in Ireland.  <br /><br />We'll have to shout louder to make sure we're not passed over.</div>
