				<div class="content">I hope someone can help.  I would like to buy a cask of whiskey (single malt or single grain) quarter or half for a very special occassion.  I am hoping to have it bottled and labelled with an individual label.  The whiskey would be offered for sale to a few individuals and will not be a commercial enterprise.  Can anyone advise if this is possible?? Are there any distilleries in Ireland were I could buy a cask.  Was hoping to have it bottled in the next 12 months.  Is there anyone I could contact and speak to about this project.  Your help would be grately appreciated.<br /><br />Regards<br />Sean</div>

That would have been your only hope, I'd say. <br /><br />You could get casks of scotch, however.</div>

				<div class="content">Actually, there might be an alternative. A lot of Cooley casks would have been bought up by independent bottlers, like Cadenhead, the Whisky Agency, Kintra... I don't know who else might have some. Douglas Laing? Anyway, some might bottle a whole cask for a customer. You'd have to be lucky to find one who has casks, though, and luckier again to get them to bottle them for you.</div>

I'm afraid other than that or you get lucky with John's suggestion above there's not a whole pile you can do.</div>
