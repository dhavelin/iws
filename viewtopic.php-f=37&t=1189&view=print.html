				<div class="content">The Irish Whiskey Society will be going back to the future at the end of this month with a very special joint tasting. In conjunction with our great friends from Cooley, we'll be comparing Tyrconnell malt whiskey from the past, present and indeed the future.<br /><br />Tyrconnell is Cooley's flagship brand, a sweet, fruity single malt that takes well to a wine finish and just keeps getting better and better the longer it's matured. It has plenty of fans all over the world, and has rightly won Cooley many awards in the past. But they're not a distillery to rest on their laurels, and Cooley's innovation manager Alex Chasko is the man responsible for developing new and interesting variants on this fine theme.<br /><br />Together with the Irish Whiskey Society's Zoltan Vari, Alex will be introducing some very special Tyrconnells from the past that are no longer easy to find, as well as reminding us of the sumptuous current range. But what has us most excited is that Alex has promised us a sneak preview of where Tyrconnell is headed in the future. It's every whiskey fan's dream to sample the limited experimental whiskeys that distillers create, and on this occasion, Cooley are throwing back the curtain to reveal some of their extra-special samples of future Tyrconnell whiskey. So if you ever wondered what whiskey will taste like years from now, this is a tasting you won't want to miss.<br /><br />We expect this event will sell out quickly, so you are advised to book your place today at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookwhen.com/iws">http://www.bookwhen.com/iws</a><!-- m -->. As usual, the venue is Brooks Hotel, Dublin 2, on Thursday, 25 Aug 2011 from 8pm - 10pm. Feel free to congregate in the bar area upstairs before being called to the tasting.</div>
