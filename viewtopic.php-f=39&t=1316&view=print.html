				<div class="content">Hi All,<br /><br />We are getting more and more spammers trying to advertise their wares on our modest little site. Because of the increasing spam traffic some legitimate users may find that they have been deactivated too because their profile and/or user name email address looks suspect. If you feel you have been deactivated unfairly please contact us and we can assist.<br /><br />If you are a new user and have a suspect email address <span style="font-weight: bold">your account WILL be de-activated. </span> this would include key board dabbled names i.e. ALSFJWHF, vulgar names or just plain incomprehensible names. <br /><br />If you are a new user and amongst your first few posts you include self promotion of your own site (which has nothing to do with whiskey) <span style="font-weight: bold">your account WILL be de-activated.</span> You are free to let people know about your site if you are a contributing member of this site and as long as it is not unsavoury. (i.e. no p**n, spam, gambling etc) <br /><br />If you are a new user and you don't post but you have included a website (which has nothing to do with whiskey) in your profile <span style="font-weight: bold">your account WILL be de-activated. </span></div>
