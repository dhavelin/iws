				<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br /><br />Just wondering could anyone provide me with some info about this whiskey and what its potential value may be. I was on the Whisky Exchange Website and they don't have it in stock. Their description of the whiskey is as follows:<br /><br />&quot;A very rare Jameson's - this 15yo is pure potstill whiskey, with no grain whiskey content at all. Bottled for the Millennium, this Jameson, considered by many connoisseurs to be the finest produced, is now almost impossible to find.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />dmcc</div>

The Millennium one  has &quot;Limited Edition&quot; on the front of the bottle. Where does it mention &quot;millennium&quot; on this packaging? I can't find it anywhere on my ones. <br /><br />Anyway, it's more valuable than the Millennium ones, because they seem to come up less often. I think it could sell for between €200 and €350.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi JohnM,<br /><br />Unfortunately this bottle isn't mine so I can't find out if there is any mention of millennium on the packaging at this time. It must be a special reserve one as you mentioned. I will get in contact with the owner of the bottle and try and get more info. Below I've attached a picture of the case but it's not a very clear image. You might be able to make out if it's similar to your bottles or not. Thanks for your help and I'll post more info when I can.</div>

I don't think the special reserve one does. I'm not sure if it's the same whiskey inside, as I don't think I've tasted your one. But the Millennium one is great to drink and seems to be climbing a lot in value recently as the supply on the internet dries up. The back of the special reserve bottles says, &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">A very special Pure Pot Still Whiskey, Triple distilled and Aged for not  less than Fifteen Years in specially selected American Bourbon Barrels and Spanish Oloroso Sherry Butts which enhance its Mellowness and Enrich its Character</span>&quot;.</div>

Good luck with it anyway. You could also contact the Celtic Whiskey Shop in Dublin for a price. Make sure you tell them it's the Special Reserve. <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com">www.celticwhiskeyshop.com</a><!-- w --></div>

Of course, no secret here, most of interest is the value of the bottle i have as i was thinking on putting it on ebay as i'am not aware of a better source to sell it.<br /><br /><br />Here some pics i have made, as i can add only 3 here some more info, it writes on the bootle &quot;Limited Edition, Bottle Number 06034</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Alexbox,<br />That is the Jameson 15 pure pot still launched to commemorate the Millennium. It's a lovely collectors item. It is more common that the one posted earlier but still worth a bit.<br />I bough one in Mealy's for €130(inc commission) and this was good value I think. One was sold recently on whiskyauctions.com for €200 but you would have to pay commission and postage to sell it. I'd say it's worth between €120 and €150. You'd expect to pay €200 in a shop all the same.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Good Whiskey Hunting,<br /><br />thank you very much for your detailed answer and your time.<br /><br />Just a general question as i'am not a native Englisch speaker. Does Irish Whiskey Society mean it's mostly for Irish people or does it mean it's only about Irish Whiskey? I'am asking this because i have a questions about a bottle of Jack Daniels which seems to be very rare, the only info i found so far is that only 200 bottles are made than back and i would like to post or open a thread about it, but if this forum is only about Irish Whiskey it might not be the right place and the last thing i would like to do is th violate any forum rules here and now. So again, any help is appreciated.</div>

And yes, Whiskey is very popular here. I personally would say that Jack Daniels is the #1 here in Bulgaria, followed by Jameson, than mostly Tullamore Dew. But now after you wrote about Tullamore Dew i remember that i twice drunk from some kind of ceramic bottle and it had a bit of taste of honey and was very good and interesting taste than back. I have to find again such Tullamore Dew  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

The society tried all of the current Dews at a tasting last year and the Black was our favourite.
