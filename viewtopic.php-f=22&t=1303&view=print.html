				<div class="content">Was hoping someone could guide me on this.....<br /><br />I'm currently researching into the differences between Scottish and Irish whisky production. The obvious one is generally that Irish whisky is triple distilled vs Scottish twice distilled. Are there any other major differences in its production - e.g. artifical enzymes, flavourings brought in? I think there isn't but am struggling to find anything concrete to prove this to myself. Do any other whiskies around the world introduce artificial agents into its production?<br /><br />Sorry, probably really naive questions, but one of those annoying questions I can not find the answer too!</div>

				<div class="content">There is nothing about the number of times a spirit is distilled that makes it Irish or Scottish.  There are distilleries in Ireland and Scotland that double and triple distill.

				<div class="content">The only technical differences between Irish and Scottish whiskey that I can think of are:<br /><ul><li>Irish whiskey must be made in Ireland, whereas Scottish whiskey must be made in Scotland.</li><li>Scottish whiskey must be matured in oak casks, whereas Irish whiskey must be matured in wooden casks (in practice, the wood is always oak)</li></ul><br />There are NO artificial additives or flavourings. Only caramel colouring may be added in either jurisdiction.<br /><br />Aside from the legal definition, I believe the &quot;single pot still&quot; style of whiskey is only made in Ireland. It could be made in Scotland, but isn't. Another difference is that Scottish whiskeys are sometimes a blend of the output of various distilleries <span style="font-style: italic">of the same type of whiskey</span> (eg two malts). That's really rare in Ireland (can't think of an example).</div>

But that's interesting as i had wondered why the word &quot;Blend/Blended&quot; is rare on Irish whiskey labels. It seems to me that Cooley are the only distillery to use it as they have established malt brands to protect and to make them identifiable. Although i may be corrected on that.</div>

That's why I was careful to say that there are Scottish whiskeys that combine <span style="font-style: italic">the same type of whiskey</span> from multiple distilleries. In Scotland it's done to create a new whiskey; in Bushmills case it's done because they don't make their own grain, and because Bushmills and Midleton were part of the same company until recently.<br /><br />The point I was aiming at was just to give an example of a whiskey style made in Scotland but not in Ireland, even though there is nothing preventing us from doing the same in Ireland, legally. You are right, 'vatted malt' or 'blended malt' is the name for this.</div>

				<div class="content">Easy guys. I'm just clarifying a point that looked foggy. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />So do Midleton produce any double distilled whiskey? I always assumed they don't, but that it is all 'technically' triple distilled. So if it's the same for Bushmills then am i correct in saying Cooley are the only distillery to double distill in recent times? So it would be fair to claim that by legal definition there are no distilling number that set Irish and Scottish whiskies apart, but there is a practical value to making this claim. As well over 95% of the pot still produced Scottish malt is double distilled, and (a guesstimate) 95% of all the whiskey produced in Ireland is triple distilled.</div>

				<div class="content">True, and you could make the same case for &quot;peated&quot;. I do feel, though, that any description of Irish whiskey that excludes Cooley is missing something vital.</div>

The Law on  Irish Whiskey is quite basic and simplified. this may change though in the coming years to give it more protection.<br /><br />Actually now that you mention distilling numbers. Do you know for sure if all Scotch Grain is only double distilled or is there any triple distilled. I'm not questioning it just really like to know. The reason I ask is that triple distilling a grain whiskey through a column still would have the added bonus of giving a smoother grain whisky for blending purposes which would be one of the uses for grain (As well as serious padding  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  ).</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>IrishWhiskeyChaser wrote:</cite>The Law on  Irish Whiskey is quite basic and simplified. this may change though in the coming years to give it more protection.</div></blockquote><br />We should end up at a point where both UK and Irish law on whiskey is just a transposed version of a common EU law.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Do you know for sure if all Scotch Grain is only double distilled or is there any triple distilled.

In a Coffey still, the two columns house different processes so I'd describe it more like a single, continuous distillation. Looking at it another way, distillation is vapourisation followed by condensation, and that only happens once in a Coffey still, even though there are two columns.<br /><br />Midleton has three columns in their still (so it's not a Coffey still) and I don't know exactly what happens inside them but I expect it's a similar story.</div>

A couple make additional reference to &quot;Patent&quot; stills. North British is the only reference i can find (Whiskypedia) to a three column Patent still but is no longer used - &quot;Three Coffey stills. Patent still with three columns decommissioned in 2007, but still in situ.&quot;</div>
