				<div class="content">The Dungourney can be bought at the distillery (or the distillery's website) for 500 euro, so maybe a little less than that as it's second hand. <br />Got the Midleton 25 year old at the start of the summer for just under 800.<br />Got the Midleton 26 year old a couple of months ago for 800 but saw it go at auction for 750.<br />Was offered the 30 year old for 1,000 but turned it down thinking 900 was a fairer price, but the seller didn't think the same way. So maybe somewhere in between would be accurate for that particular bottle.</div>

				<div class="content">Agree with the previous post, I got my 30 yo's for €800 &amp; €900 respectively<br /><br />€800 is a very good price for the 25yo<br /><br />A couple of 26yo's sold for €700 apiece recently, <br /><br />Therefore a range of €700 to €900 is achievable, more on a good day!<br /><br />Dungourney €400-€450<br /><br />Prestons is difficult to value but I'd guess €150-€200 but others might differ, as it is really just a Cooley malt with a Preston's thrown in, which s a pity as the Preston's was worth far more on it's own, I have a half bottle of Preston's in my own collection. A couple of more opinions on the Preston's might help.<br /><br />Regards TWB</div>
