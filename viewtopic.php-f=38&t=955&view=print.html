I'm with Eircom too but have 3mb  averaging at about 2.7mb <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

After all, those sort of games you can actually play for real, even without signing up for the British army and packing yourself off to Afghan.<br /><br />World domination, on the other hand, is something that should probably be only attempted in the virtual arena!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />But I've wiped out a few hours on the new Civ 5 already this week, so it's getting put away till I get some work done.</div>
