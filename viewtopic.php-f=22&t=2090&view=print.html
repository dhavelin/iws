				<div class="content">I think it really depends on the whiskey. For a pot still whiskey it's really hard to think of anything other than a good bottled stout, even the BIG name, or an Irish red ale. For single malts I reckon ale is the way to - lagers etc an be too light though that's a big generalisation. The ale itself really depends on the whisky - I like something like an IPA with lighter malts like bushmills or tyrconnell but like a more robust ale with a more robust whisk(e)y.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd be very similar to you Iain.<br /><br />Totally agree with sps and stout for me a nice creamy pint of stout is the order here. Lagavulin goes well too though.<br /><br />The heavy hopped IPAs lends to a rich sweet and or light easy drinking whiskeys as Iain says.<br /><br />For a big smokey single malt I like a smooth/sweet bottled stout. <br /><br />Talking of which I was lucky enough to get a large bottle of Jameson cask matured stout for Lady's Well brewery for crimson. Does any one know what a Jameson cask looks like  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Larger is kinda wierd but I can drink a larger with some Bourbons for some strange reason.<br /><br /><br />Currently drinking a Powers Sig Reserve with aSierra Nevada Celebration Fresh hop Ale. Basically a small batch rich flavoured IPA. Seems to work well together, the sweetness and spiciness of the Powers seems to go well with deep but dry taste of the IPA. Real winter drinking ... Lovely.</div>
