This exact topic has caused a lot of fuss on another forum with sour results so something to think hard about.</div>

We will probably need to make more sub forums in here anyway and could use it in conjunction with the Polls forum.</div>

				<div class="content">I like the new forum.  The old one was a bit clunky, while this one uses software that will be familiar to forumers everywhere.  I think this will encourage more posting than we had seen previously.  Great job of the setup so far guys.<br /><br />Cheers</div>

I have been terribly bad about posting on other whiskey forums these last few months (a self-imposed isolation because of work) but you can be sure I sneaked a few looks at your site before installing the software here. It's definitely the one to emulate.</div>
