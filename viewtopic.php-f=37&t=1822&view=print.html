				<div class="content">Wouldn't mind a report myself. However the line up if I remember correctly was ...<br /><br />Concannon's PetitvShriaz Finish<br />Bushmills Cask Strength, Single Cask, Sherry Cask,<br />Yellow Spot<br />Irishman Cask Strength (New Version)<br />????<br />IWS Midleton Cask Strength, Single Cask, Bourbon Cask<br /><br /><br />???? = Possibly Ally's Connemara Amintado Cask but could be corrected on that.<br /><br />The IWS offering was the winner on the night with the BUshmills a head and shoulders second which does not surprise me as they are cracking whiskeys but I think it may have been a mini surprise to some.<br /><br />It should be noted that  All Are top Quality offerings even the bargain basement Concannon.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for that! Now that you say it, I believe you are right about the Amontillado cask. A little dickie bird at the CWS might have mentioned it to me.<br /><br />I'd like to hear what people thought about the various whiskeys.<br /><br />Gary told me yesterday that it's a new batch of Yellow Spot. How does it compare? I have some of the new stuff here, unopened. I really hope it's as good. I didn't expect a different batch when I bought it.</div>

				<div class="content">Your right about the line up.<br />The Connemara Amintado Cask was a pleasant surprise, not a hint of sulphur that Jim Murray was on about.<br /><br />The Yellow Spot was from another batch. I believe they were produced 6 months after the first but  I also heard that they may have been bottles returned from the French market. <br /><br />I liked it and would say that it was a little softer than the other one, but that may have been me.<br /><br />Great night had by all  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>
