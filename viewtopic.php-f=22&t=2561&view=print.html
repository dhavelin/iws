				<div class="content">It went well. <br />Eric Ryan &amp; Billy Leighton were among the IDL group. They were mobbed for most of the day. <br />Colum Egan &amp; Seamus Lowry were on the Bushmills stand. <br />John Teeling &amp; his wife were on the Great Northern Distillery one. <br />Bernard Walsh was there for the Walsh Distillery. <br />I seen John Quinn from Tullamore at Fionnán's book launch so I'm assuming he was in attendance too. <br />Lots of others were up too. A great day. <br /><br />I was on the IWS stand in the afternoon and tried to see as much as I could in the evening but there wasn't enough time. It's hard sampling and trying to stay the distance too. There was others I'd have like to see but didn't have time. <br /><br />Well done to all and I hope to get there again next year.</div>

				<div class="content">What an excellent show!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Great venue, great numbers of attendees, great stands, great whiskeys, great food, great Irish Whiskey book authored &amp; photographed by fellow Society members (genuinely, well done Fionnán &amp; Ove!), great Charitable support; and, even great rugby I believe, though my attention had to be specifically directed off the whiskey script towards the big screen for that so I'll have to downgrade that last 'great' to a 'good'! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />The level of engagement with the distilleries and food producers was second to none, so hopefully this will go from strength to strength.<br /><br />At most of the stands throughout the day, Society members were to be seen, filling notebooks when they weren't having their glasses filled, so presumably &amp; hopefully everyone enjoyed the show.<br /><br />Well done to all involved!<br />J.<br /><br />PS: Anyone discover any surprises?</div>

				<div class="content">Flew over from America but had to cut the trip short, as my mother and mother-in-law (both in their 90's) went into hospital at the same time. A huge disappointment to miss the event and master classes after attending last year's at Mansion House, but I hope to come to next year's and meet up with fellow IWS members!<br /><br />Pat</div>

				<div class="content">Whiskey Live visited the Printworks in Dublin Castle once again for 2017 ... Would be nice to get a few commentaries from anybody that was there.<br /><br />I went for the first time in a good few years and enjoyed it immensely and it was great to meet up with a few old faces and many new ones too.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />I went to the Redbreast 21 year Masterclass which was very good. Basically a deconstruction of the Rebreast 21yo where we sampled the 3 main components of this wonderful SPS.<br /><br />The first one we tasted was a 32yo Trad pot Bourbon cask which was circa 46.1%. Next was a 26yo Trad Pot Sherry cask which was very very nice  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  and last was another Bourbon cask but this time a 22yo Light Pot. The trad pot is a heavier style of SPS but out of the 2 bourbon barrels I actually preferred the Light pot version more but all were very good. <br /><br />I'm a sherry man so I was expecting the Sherry cask to be my most preferred glass of the day but I have to say the over all combination to make the 21yo is fantastic, yes the end product seems to better the the sum of its parts, which klet me reaffirm are all wonderful on their own.<br /><br />We also had a major bonus as we were all given a specially created 10cl sample of the Redbreast 21yo but in Cask strength format @ 52.9%. Thanks IDL, what an amazing gift  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">It was a great event. It gets better every year. <br />I would prefer if it was a 2 day event and we had longer to go around. I was on the IWS stand in the afternoon and covered a while in the evening too. I wish I had another hour to see it all. <br /><br />I had a strategy in mind to see certain stalls and knew where the special samples were hidden. I missed lots of those unfortunately. Hopefully next time. <br /><br />The Redbreast 21 masterclass was great. I'd like the go to more of those too but more than 2 in one day would be too much I think. If it was over 2 days,I'm sure I'd take advantage of them. <br /><br />Great to see you again Adrian. I meet up with a great group of guys from the International Police Association in Friday and had a brilliant day out with them. Absolutely great craic with them.</div>
