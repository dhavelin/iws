I'm assuming Cooleys/Beam Suntory but I couldn't find any more information.</div>

				<div class="content">I heard once, but cannot confirm, that it is a Cooley blend. I'd bet so too. I'm not good at tasting notes but I did like it more than other Cooley private labels. It was richer and more complex than what I'd expect from a $26 single malt. I would also say that the hint of smoke is a very small hint...</div>

I was lucky to get several bottles of the Original release for a much fairer price and it is still possibly the best release to date.<br /><br />Have one open currently with a couple in reserve  <img src="images/smilies/icon_sunny.gif" alt=":sunny:" title="Sunny" /></div>

				<div class="content">I've been living in Africa for a few months and limited in the availability, especially Irish. So the last I've finished was a LITRE bottle of $24 (22 EUR) Tullamore DEW, with standard Jameson locally costing a whopper $17 (15 EUR) per litre. When it's that price the bottles are hitting the bin much quicker! <br /><br />Trying to decide what my first to get through on return home will be; currently tossing up either WT Redhead, RB Lustau or Tullamore Phoenix...it's a terrible dilemma to have!</div>

Not sure what it's like in Europe but in Chicago it can still be found. I'd guess it's a slow seller.  I bought a couple for the collection before it's gone forever.</div>
