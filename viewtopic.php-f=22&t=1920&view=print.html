				<div class="content">anyone see the Celtic Whiskey Shop's recent facebook post about a new dublin distillery? They sounded very secretive about it for something i would have thought was well known by this pont. Anyone know if this a distinct operation from the upcoming Teeling distillery?</div>

				<div class="content">I presume it is one and the same, just awaiting confirmation of the precise location, but have a fair idea where they are trying to locate. I believe they are close to signing contracts or just recently have. Keeping an eye out for planning!</div>

The size of the Irish whiskey business being what it is (relative to Scotch), I'd say we are still in &quot;the more the merrier&quot; phase. And it's clear that TWC is a class act that will add shine to the whole category.</div>

All good as far as Im concerned.</div>
