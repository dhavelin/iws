				<div class="content">I've done a 1L cask and in all fairness it was just killed with oak.  Wood was probably too fresh.<br /><br />I first finished the cask off with Amontillado for 3 months.<br /><br />Then a mix of 4:1 ratio of Cooley 4yo whiskey(Tyrconnel style) and Ardbeg Still young. Circa 1.2 liters filled it and got about 750ml back after evapouration<br /><br />I called it Coolbeg  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Was going to leave it for 1 year min and tasted it after 2 months and was progressing along nicely but found after 3 months it was ruined by over influence of the wood.<br /><br />I'm still trying to get rid of samples I mean you can have a sample if you like  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />It might be fun to do again and maybe my little cask has seasoned at this stage  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/HPIM3226.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Whiskey%20Project/HPIM3229-1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />............ Water .......... Sherry .......... Whiskey after ageing ........... Original Whiskey Colour<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There are a few others that have tried it with 5L casks and it seems that they evaporate very quickly too</div>
