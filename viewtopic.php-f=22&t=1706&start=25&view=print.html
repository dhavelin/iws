				<div class="content">The only real problem with all these is that they're all pretty much Bourbon cask SPS which means they're mostly variations on a theme. I'm looking up at the 9 SC midletons I have and I'd be hard pressed to pick one over the other apart from the very first Celtic whiskey shop one which was a single cask blend! It stands out for that reason and of all of them it's the one I wish I'd bought more of. Which is not in any way to knock true others- they're all great whiskey just kinda similar!</div>

These were never sold and given to reps and others at the event for free. €200/300 would be a good price I think.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd say there's more of a premium for this one, compared to the other single casks, given it was never for sale. The Jameson One In a MIllion went for silly money, but the packaging was much better.<br /><br /> I paid €350 for one of these Midletons, which I think is a good price. If I were you, I'd approach somewhere like the Celtic Whiskey Shop. Unless someone here is interested.</div>
