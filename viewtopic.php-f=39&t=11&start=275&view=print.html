				<div class="content">Hello all...I became aware of this forum through Adrian's contributions on the WWW forum.  I will post as often as possible as I look forward to continuing my general whisk(e)y education, and Irish whiskey in particular.  <br /><br />My Irish whiskey experience is limited to a tasting at a pub in March (Locke's 8 yo, Green Spot, and MVR 2011), Redbreast 12 and Bushmills Black Bush (cabinet bottles...both very enjoyable), and Jamesons 18, Tyrconnell Single Malt, Bushmills 1608, and Tullamore Dew (pours at pubs over the past year or so).<br /><br />My wishlist includes Jamesons 18, Redbreast and Connemara CS, Connemara Turf Mor, another Bushmills (likely 16 or 21...suggestions/recommendations welcome), and others.<br /><br />Being in Ontario, Canada, the Irish whiskey selection seems to be improving, though would likely still be considered somewhat limited.  The available bottles (and their Can$ prices) in Ontario are here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?STOCK_TYPE_NAME=All&amp;ITEM_NAME=&amp;KEYWORDS=&amp;ITEM_NUMBER=&amp;productListingType=&amp;LIQUOR_TYPE_SHORT_=Spirits&amp;CATEGORY_NAME=Whisky%2FWhiskey&amp;SUB_CATEGORY_NAME=Irish&amp;PRODUCING_CNAME=*&amp;PRODUCING_REGION_N=*&amp;UNIT_VOLUME=*&amp;SELLING_PRICE=*&amp;LTO_SALES_CODE=N&amp;VQA_CODE=N&amp;KOSHER_CODE=N&amp;VINTAGES_CODE=N&amp;VALUE_ADD_SALES_CO=N&amp;AIR_MILES_SALES_CO=N&amp;SWEETNESS_DESCRIPTOR=&amp;VARIETAL_NAME=&amp;WINE_STYLE=&amp;language=EN&amp;style=+LCBO.css&amp;page=1&amp;action=result&amp;sort=sortedName&amp;order=1&amp;resultsPerPage=50" class="postlink">http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?STOCK_TYPE_NAME=All&amp;ITEM_NAME=&amp;KEYWORDS=&amp;ITEM_NUMBER=&amp;productListingType=&amp;LIQUOR_TYPE_SHORT_=Spirits&amp;CATEGORY_NAME=Whisky%2FWhiskey&amp;SUB_CATEGORY_NAME=Irish&amp;PRODUCING_CNAME=*&amp;PRODUCING_REGION_N=*&amp;UNIT_VOLUME=*&amp;SELLING_PRICE=*&amp;LTO_SALES_CODE=N&amp;VQA_CODE=N&amp;KOSHER_CODE=N&amp;VINTAGES_CODE=N&amp;VALUE_ADD_SALES_CO=N&amp;AIR_MILES_SALES_CO=N&amp;SWEETNESS_DESCRIPTOR=&amp;VARIETAL_NAME=&amp;WINE_STYLE=&amp;language=EN&amp;style=+LCBO.css&amp;page=1&amp;action=result&amp;sort=sortedName&amp;order=1&amp;resultsPerPage=50</a> (sorry it's such a long link...not entirely sure why).  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Pricing of Irish whiskey actually seems to be reasonable, on par, or (in some cases) cheaper than the US!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />   Cross border purchases of Irish whiskey would be limited to those not available in Ontario.<br /><br />I look forward to meeting you all as time goes on...</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />This is Naveen here from India.  Well drinking whisky is a a way of life for many of us here...  I got introduced to whisky way back when I graduated; started with a brand called Royal Challenge, its a blended whisky, well admired here in India; thereafter had other popular whiskys like Blender's Pride, Signature, Antiquity Blue, Peter Scot...  Some time later I got introduced to Scotch Whisky... 1st drink was Jonny Walker Black Label, got to taste many more like, Ballentine's Finest, The Famous Grouse, Black Dog, 100 Pipers, Whithe &amp; Mackey.. the list goes on... but it was only a few years back that I got introduced to Single Malts and yes my idea of whisky completely changed. I must say I have literally fallen in love with the Single Malts... Started with Glenmorangie, then had more like Laphroig, Taliskar, Glenkinchie, Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, Glen Elgin, Cardu and many more... The world of Single Malts is a completely different world, its much more than just a drink...  I have had an exposure to quite a few of the amazing single malts from Scotland.  What I wish now is to explore the world of Irish Whiskey...  <br /><br />Now that I am here in this forum, I believe I would be able to learn about Irish Whiskey and get started..<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

The contributors on this forum have been friendly to this Canadian, who is also a relative newbie to Irish whiskey.  Bushmills Black Bush provided a nice entry point into (blended) Irish whiskey for myself, which I have since followed with Redbreast 12 (pure pot still).  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hello folks. I am new to the site, and wanted to introduce myself. Whiskey is my drink of choice, and lately I have been expanding beyond my usual choices of Jameson or Makers Mark. I have had some great bourbons in the last month, now it is time to check out some new Irish Whiskey.<br /><br />I have had Jameson, Tullamore Dew and Bushmills on many occasions. I plan on grabbing a bottle of Powers tomorrow, and maybe a bottle of Redbreast. I will check the forum for peoples thoughts, and decide!</div>

				<div class="content">My name is Joel, as you may have guessed.  I live in Victoria, British Columbia and serve in the Royal Canadian Navy.  I have long been serious about single malt but in the last five years I have started to branch out, largely because of my long- suffering wife.  She is an American so I started to pay attention to US whisky more as I spent more time in the USA.  I gradually managed to interest her in whisky and she was keen to explore to I introduced her to Irish whisky in the form of Redbreast and in the process was reminded how good it was.  That quickly led to a Redbreast addiction (the 12 is the only PPS available in BC).  Around that time I was getting tired of single malt as everyone was an &quot;expert&quot; and the prices continued to get more and more silly.  I opened a bottle of Willie Napier to celebrate my son's baptism and then got very serious about Irish Whisky.  I'm especially interested in the history of it and have done and continue to do a great deal of reading on the subject.  I also seek out examples from closed distilleries to both try and stockpile as I did for years with Scotch single malt (and continue to do at a much reduced pace).  <br />I am lucky to have a patient wife who will, at a minimum, pretend to listen to me as I go on about booze. She will also drink it with me which can be a mixed blessing.  I also have two very supportive West Highland Terriers who make up my entourage.<br />When I'm not obsessing about booze, I can shift to military history, steam locomotives, or antique fire arms.  <br /><br />My favourite everyday Irish Whisky is Powers John's Lane Release, best I've had so far is the Willie Napier closley followed by Bow Street Redbreast.</div>
