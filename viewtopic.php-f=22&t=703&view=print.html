				<div class="content">are there any good places to get bourbons/american whiskey around galway?  always lean towards bourbons in the warmer months for some reason.  sadly, i never really see anything other than jim beam white and jack daniels.  has anyone ever seen buffalo trace, makers mark, woodford reserve or knob creek around?</div>

				<div class="content">As it happens, I'm employed in the live sports TV industry, specifically horse racing. I've worked the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, Belmont, and the other big race events, and I got a few years ago, from the TV crew at Churchill Downs, the OFFICIAL Kentucky Derby Mint Julep recipe:<br /><br />Bring two cups of water and one cup white sugar to a boil, stirring lightly, lower heat to simmer, and keep stirring until sugar water begins to turn amber. Let cool to room temperature, then pour into a quart jar. When cool, add clean mint leaves until the jar is filled loosely with the mint, stir and crush the leaves in the jar, cover, and place in refrigerator overnight, better 24 hours. <br /><br />Take a julep glass (similar to a pilsner-style glass), fill with crushed ice, pour in two ounces of bourbon, then fill with sugar-mint-water mixture. Stir lightly, add mint leaf sprig as garnish.<br /><br />Enjoy with care. Warning: two ounces of bourbon and lots of sugar! Delicious, but devious.<br /><br />Note: This recipe can be a tad sweet for some, so add a drop or two of lemon juice to tone down the sweetness.</div>
