				<div class="content">I'll second that Will.<br />It was a really great show, with plenty of exhibitors, good quality engagement in terms of highlighting future plans, delicious food and it also provided the opportunity to donate to a very worthy cause. I have to say that I really enjoyed it and it was good to catch up with many fellow whiskey enthusiasts that I hadn't seen in a while. <br />I'm certainly looking forward to the next one!<br />Cheers,<br />J.</div>
