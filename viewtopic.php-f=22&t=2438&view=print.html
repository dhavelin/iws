				<div class="content">Got some samples of glenfiddich to try.  brown label  reserve cask,  green label select cask and a vintage cask peated. <br /><br />All except the peated (prob due to the strong peat flavour)  have a strong taste of potato based potcheen, that dull starchy taste that develops after you swallow it and makes you grimace. <br /><br />I've never tasted this from whiskey before,  and I am thinking maybe the potcheen flavour isn't search,  but some other component of a pot still been that is usually removed from whiskeys but in the case of glenfiddich,  a little is left behind. <br />Am I making up some of this up in my head or has anyone any deeper knowledge on this? <br /><br />I</div>

				<div class="content">I think the taste your getting is young whiskey. <br /><br />Poitin is traditionally made with barley. Some claim potatoes but that's basically vodka. I even see some are using Beet now, well that's just shameful. <br /><br />When spirit comes off the still it looks, smells and tastes similar to poitin/poteen.</div>

				<div class="content">Interesting,  so what I'm tasting is young whiskey.  I would have assumed that glenfiddich would be at least 6+ years. <br /><br />I also made the assumption that the acme Tesco whiskey you get for 11 quid a bottle would be young,  but it doesn't have that taste (still pretty naff though)!</div>

The cheaper blends are predominantly grain whiskey or column still whiskey. <br /><br />I'll have to crack open a Glenfiddich soon to see if I can taste what your talking about. I know it's true for Paddy.</div>
