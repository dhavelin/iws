				<div class="content">Interesting Bottle ... not 100% sure but the bottle looks old-ish<br /><br /><br />Firstly it is minimum pre 1952 because it is labelled &quot;To His Majesty The King&quot;<br /><br />these are the dates times lines we have to play with<br /><br />Edward VII 	(1901-10)<br />George V 	(1910-36)<br />Edward VIII 	(1936) the King that never became King<br />George VI 	(1936-52)<br /><br /><br />I very much doubt that it is Edward VII 1901-10 as it possible too early for this label even though the bottle type might fit as it looks old but it's hard to tell. Basically we just don't see bottles from this era. However this version of the label did not change much for a very long time. <br /><br />So possibly early George VI or George V as my gut feeling would be pre WWII. However would need a closer look.<br /><br />Value is another very hard one as the market is a bit depressed and it depends on available buyers. This on ebay would probably fetch only 2-300Euro but would command a lot more in a specialist retailers shop. But selling on the open market you would not get a retailers price. It's all down to luck and meeting the right person to sell it to.<br /><br />Where did you get it or how did you come by it ... do you have any provenance?<br /><br />Are you UK or Ireland based?</div>

				<div class="content">Is it possible that the coat of arms varies from monarch to monarch and you could identify the king on that basis?  I don't know enough about heraldry to say.<br /><br />The capsule is very shiny in the photo, but those who know about these things (and there are plenty of them on this forum) may think it looks OK.  It could be just the camera flash, of course.<br /><br />Re comments on another thread, I note 1780 is used on this label as the foundation date for the Jameson distillery.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br />Thanks for all the prompt replys.Im pretty sure the bottle is genuine as i was allowed to pick any bottle (wine or whiskey) from a collectors cellar back in 1988 in San Francisco in lieu of a tip.Needless to say he had just hit the jackpot and was in a giving mood.What i was really more interested in was the age of the bottle so over the weekend i will upload better pictures and check it for distinguishing marks top and bottom. Once again thanks for all the replys.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>TheWhiskeyBro wrote:</cite>Hi there,<br /><br />Bottle shape looks older,<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />That is what I was thinking as the bottle does looks quite old i.e. early part of the century so from the shape it could be anything from the latey 1800's to late 1930's (Not sure about 40's???) But the label would not pre date 1900.  <br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>TheWhiskeyBro wrote:</cite>Hi there,<br /><br />'To His Majesty The King' was on Jameson bottles up until the 1940s,<br /><br />Label (if a US bottle) does not have 'Sole Importer W.A. Taylor'<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />I think the &quot;To HM the King&quot; would make this a British Empire Bottling so came from Ireland/England to the states.<br /><br />This creates another conundrum why was this in the states, especially west coast? East coast you could say maybe by ship.<br /><br />So it would have needed to have been brought into the US by someone travelling rather than it being part of a commercial enterprise (i.e. W&gt;A&gt; Taylor). So was it brought in during Prohibition during the swinging 20's into the early 30's. For me it looks that period but as mentioned the fill level is very high for a 70-90 year old bottle .... so that is why your getting a lot of mixed views .... who knows.<br /><br />I think the capsule may be the key here ... if you can find any printed information on the capsule ...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>good_whiskey_hunting wrote:</cite><br />Here one i found on Ebay but didn't like the look of the seal.it's from the states.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/370572631629?ssPageName=STRK:MEDWX:IT#ht_762wt_698">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/370572631629? ... _762wt_698</a><!-- m --><br /><br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, wouldn't touch that with a barge pole ...

				<div class="content">I think Whiskeychaser could have hit the nail on the head dating it to prohibition, bootleggers/criminal gangs often used their own whiskey and bottles and stuck an Irish label on them, giving Irish whiskey a terrible reputation after prohibition was lifted.

				<div class="content">Ah yeah, I just mean for the fella's reputation in general. The corks are the same. They're a cork with a plastic top, kind of ribbed (or else it's wood). The one I have in front of me I changed the cork, because it shrunk, so I used one from another bottle. I have a few in the attic and another one here somewhere among the rest. I'll try to dig them out. My filing skills are not very good.<br /><br />Actually, the one I'm looking at was waxed. And the wax stops where the old plastic cover would have started - the wax also covers the bottom of the tax stamp - the bit that would have been exposed from the cover.</div>
