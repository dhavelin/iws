				<div class="content">thought i'd start posting some of the notes i've been keeping for the SPS project. <br /><br />These are the notes i took for the 3rd CWS Midleton Single Cask (2010). First fill bourbon barrel SPS. Cask #71578. 46% ABV. Bonded 10 December 1996.<br /><br />Nose: Banana, a little grass-- fresh cut grass specifically and a weird fresh cut cilantro type aroma at the back of the nose. A late spring type version of the usual SPS spice you'd get off something closer to a Greenspot. the familiar bourbon barrel honey and vanilla notes are hard to find but the legacy has definitely brought out some strange character in the native pot still aromas.<br /><br />Palate: Pot-still spice in a light spring laid-back interpretation with none of the intense raw ginger I usually get from a midleton-make sps but, if you look for it through the fresh grass flavors, the ginger is still there.<br /><br />Finish: this is where the bourbon influence seems to have been hiding. creamy vanilla in a big way mixed with more of that same fresh cut grass interpretation of SPS spice (but still laid back).<br /><br /><br />After a dash of water...<br /><br />Nose: light bourbon influence, instead of bananas it becomes almost like banana flavored candy, (think laffy taffy banana). Dead-ends a bit in comparison to the unwatered nose.<br /><br />Palate: more laffy taffy banana with warm familiar SPS character mixing in well. The SPS spice is more allspice than cinnamon spice.<br /><br />Finish: Warm SPS spice mixed with a thick wave of the same laffy taffy banana candy flavor. Spice not as long as the unwatered dram.</div>
