				<div class="content">That a Late 70's bottle I think.<br /><br />The screw cap arrived in the late 60's I think. The bottles had the 1784 instead of 1608 until the mid 70's when they found another 176 years of history. There was no one to object to them calling themselves the oldest distillery since Lockes closed in the late 50's. <br /><br />It has 70 Proof which would have changed in 1980 I think. I stand to be corrected.<br /><br />I think it may be an exported bottle, Irish bottles were 70cl then I think. Where did your Father in Law get the bottle?<br /><br />I've never seen a label like that with the 3 stars on top. I've seen later ones have 'The Original' and some earlier ones have 9 year old. <br /><br />I wouldn't have an idea of value. They range from â‚¬20-60 on whiskyauction.com but I didn't see one with a label like yours.</div>

				<div class="content">This is probably early 80's all right. The change from Proof to ABV happended as you say Willie in 1980 but with both being used it would stand to reason that they used both for a while until the buying public got used to te new ABV system.<br /><br />No major value I'm afraid as it is the basic Blend (Whiote Bush) but nice all the same.You might get a few quid extra for it with the Heraldic Box but it is quite common. basically Coat of Arms for prominent Surnames of Ireland was the theme if I remember correctly.</div>
