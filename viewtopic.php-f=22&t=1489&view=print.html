Out of curiosity, as i dont think it's been discussed here, how do they compare to the other store-specific bottlings done for CWS?</div>

				<div class="content">Never been in T2 myself but others have on my behalf. <br /><br />I think out of all the single bourbon cask Midleton's I've tried (2 Airport, 4 CWS) the best was the CWS first one - the 12yo blend.<br /><br />Personally I find it much of a muchness between the others, though it's a while since I did a comparative tasting. Maybe it's time to retry....</div>

				<div class="content">Again looking to my right....<br /><br />All it says on the label is Cask No. 95991 A single cask of aged pot still and grain whiskey. There's no age statement but Ally reckoned it was around 12. No idea on the mix when the cask was filled but I always thought it tasted like what the 12yo Powers would taste like if it was 46% and ncf. So I guess the grain would be somewhere in the region of 20-30%. Just a guess.<br /><br />Pouring one now. Not that that will enlighten me any further.</div>

				<div class="content">That's as good as confirmed to me. Surely to be a single cask it had to be mixed before it went into the cask. Then again as it did not have an age statement it may have been blended and then re-casked for a while. It was the first single cask Midleton so maybe they used one of their test casks just to see what the reaction to a single cask release was.<br /><br />your making me thirsty though so can you refrain from mentioning any of your further tastings for tonight  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>

				<div class="content">So now I'm onto Cask 74060, the 46% <span style="font-weight: bold">2nd</span> fill bourbon cask 1994 SPS for the Celtic Whiskey Shop. I guess this is a 16/17yo. I'm prefering this to the T2 - there's a lot more going on despite the lower strength. For it's age it's somehow retained some of the fresher fruitiness you get with a green spot. Something to do with it being a second fill I guess but the oak is tuned down a bit and along with that youthfulness there's a decent spiciness too. Personally I think this is the better bet, and it's a few quid cheaper too I guess.<br /><br />Maybe now it'll be back to the SC Blend for a final comparrison.</div>
