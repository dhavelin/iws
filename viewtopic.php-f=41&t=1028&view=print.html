If you do happen to be in there and notice if they have it and the price that would be great!<br />I also have a 'classic whiskies of Ireland' stand - it is used (came from a pub in Drogheda about 8 years ago) but looks nice - would it have any value do you know?</div>

I think your best bet would be to stick it up on ebay as the 2000 editions seem to get good prices there. Technically it is not a Millennium edition just released in 2000 as they release one every year but this would have been released late in 2000. People still think of it as a Millennium edition though and it always sems to make more than say a 2001 or 1999.</div>

				<div class="content">Of course that rule of thumb really only applies to the retail price. <br /><br />From around 1996 onwards the maximum you should pay is €200-250.<br /><br />My own guide for retail would be RRP €145 for 2006-2011 then add €20 for every year prior to that with a slight premium for the 2000 vintage for some reason.<br /><br />Collectors will generally pick the recent bottlings up for far cheaper than that. The average price I paid for 2000s bottlings is c. €130, the 1990s cost an ave €200. the 1980s bottlings €300 +/- €50.<br /><br />So as said many times before there is the 'Auction' value, the 'Retail' value and the 'Insurance/Replacement' value if you could get insurance.</div>

These Millennium Bottles usually only fetch 100-120Euro. The whiskey if it was retailed by bushmills would retail much higher today but there are so many of these out there that the resale prices don't really go up. Basically 365 casks were sold and bottled for private individuals and companies for the millennium.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br /><br />When clearing out my late father's drinks cabinet I found three interesting bottles of Irish Whiskey. Not being a drinker myself -- and therefore not knowledgeable about such matters -- I was wondering about their background and how much they may be worth. <br /><br />The bottles are:<br />1. Old Bushmills Millennium Single Barrel Single Malt 1982 (Cask No. 18429, Bottle No. 181, 51.6%, 700ml) in its original wood box. (See attached photo.)<br />2. Midleton Very Rare 1999 (40%, 700ml) in its original wood box. (Two bottles, one open and one sealed; see attached photo of the open bottle.)<br /><br />Any assistance regarding the background, value and rarity of these two bottles would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />(BTW, my father's collection included a number of other interesting and rare spirits, eg of cognac and various liqueurs, but the above are the only Irish Whiskeys he owned.)<br /><br />Thanking you in advance,<br /><br />David<br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:dglassman@bezeqint.net">dglassman@bezeqint.net</a><!-- e --></div>

Should still be okay to drink though as the fill level is quite high. I would say either drink it or gift it to someone who would enjoy it.
