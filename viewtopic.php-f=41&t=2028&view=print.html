				<div class="content">Hi all,<br />I am here a while now and have researched a lot on this forum (countless hours of reading) and have learnt a lot!<br /><br />Firstly apologies if i should not have started a new thread here but decided was best way to introduce myself!<br /><br />From a financial point of view investing in Irish whiskey maybe safe but for sure not lucrative, however it is my way of inheriting history and passing on our drink one day. I do like a dram and have enjoyed bottles such as a red breast 12 amongst a scotch or two.<br /><br />As regards collecting whiskey Scotch is number one but to me I have no interest personally in Scotch.<br /><br />So i have received great advice from people such as JohnM and Irishwhiskeychassr and kurtbenoit but all advice and offers had to be put on hold until i finished my professional exams and could spend the time researching before committing. There was also the issue of putting the limited funds i held into education or whiskey and as much as i love it that choice had to be taken. <br /><br />Now that i am finished exams, i have finally kick started the collection as follows;-<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Last pic is again the cork distillers one sorry!<br /><br />Also jameson looks resealed from pic but seal is torn a tiny bit on one side from wear but is well in tact to the point it was most definitely not open, apologies picture is poor at showing same!<br /><br />Also i am from cork and live in waterford and am open to expanding collection but only buying if the deal is good, not looking to complete sets etc yet so will not pay crazy retail prices and also have a few great offers from members i contacted here so will be expanding in coming months!<br /><br />Cheers and hope someone enjoys pics and are happy to see a new enthusiastic young collector!</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome Danny. <br />Good few nice bottles already. It a pity you weren't here a few months ago. I could have helped with some more but alas they are settling on shelves in some reparable whiskey shops. <br /><br />My best advise is be patient, all good things come to those who wait.</div>

				<div class="content">All advice appreciated, its trying to apply the brakes is hardest part now!!!<br /><br />Yes any decent offers from forum members are welcome but at the moment no i wouldn be interested in paying retail prices, in my opinion same is only for newer whiskies or if need a particular one. Otherwise and offers at collectors rate for old or relatively newer collectible bottles are all welcome!<br /><br />But yes do love the midletons and the much older stuff!</div>

				<div class="content">Hey and pleased to meet you,<br /><br />Yes celtic whiskey shop is very impressive, i love the selection but in general find a little better value with collectors as no overheads like cws!<br /><br />However for a newer vintage yes i love cws and worldwidewines in ardkeen waterford!</div>
