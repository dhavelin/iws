				<div class="content">Thanks John.<br />The books are being sold as one lot. It would be very difficult , if not impossible, for a voluntary body (such as the Irish Whiskey Society) with no premises and changing personnel in committee each year to hold and care for a library of books. Paradoxically,it's easier to possess casks of whiskey since they are safely cared for in bond, and by someone else!</div>

I viewed the collection (books are another of my weaknesses).They were  about Whisky rather than Whiskey. From memory, I think they were all Scottish distilleries related.</div>
