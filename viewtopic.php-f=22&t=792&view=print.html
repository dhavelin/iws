				<div class="content">James McAllister and Sons are the likely source of your bottle.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.potstill.de/oldads.htm">http://www.potstill.de/oldads.htm</a><!-- m --> includes a pic of one of their ads.<br />They were apparently operational from at least the 1850s, but when Alfred Barnard visited Ireland in the late 1880s he made no mention of them having a functioning distillery, though they appear to have continued marketing whiskey well after that date.<br />My best guess is that they were bottlers and bonders. There were plenty such in Ireland at that time, bottling own label whiskeys, and Mitchells are the last of that honourable tradition in Ireland today.<br />I know Irish Whiskey Chaser possesses a bottle of one brand of theirs called Clan Colla, so perhaps he might be able to shed more light?</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, very little is known about this crew ... but their adverts and empty bottles pop up regular enough.<br /><br />WOuld love to see a picture of your bottle...<br /><br />I got a bottle by them before by the name Clan Colla. I got it very cheap but turned out to be an dear empty bottle as I am pretty positive it was not authentic. See picture <a href="http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s285/irishwhiskeychaser/Pure%20Pot%20Still%20Whiskey/ClanColla.jpg" class="postlink">here</a> if your wondering there is a replacement cork in the neck.</div>

				<div class="content">I hate to add to your suspicions but that bottle looks very modern and the label extremely clean for something that purports to predate the 30s.</div>
