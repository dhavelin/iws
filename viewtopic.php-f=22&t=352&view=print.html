				<h3>The magical haunted whiskey glass</h3>

				<div class="content">Like other society members who attended last night's president's selection tasting, I was delighted to receive my 'Irish Whiskey Society Founder' Glencairn glass.<br />I carefully put it away in my bag and enjoyed the tasting (report coming soon to a website near you.)<br />This morning, I completely forgot about the glass, grabbed the same bag and ran out to work. During the course of the day, I was hither and thither, doing a couple of interviews, running into Government buildings for the Dublin Diocesan report launch and back to the office, and then finally, a quick meeting with a photographer about a job before home.<br />So an hour or so ago, as I was making my dinner, I got a sudden chill in my guts. My glass! <br />I had flung my bag roughly around all day, lobbing it at the floor in my office, throwing it against the wall in meetings, even treading on it at a press conference. It couldn't possibly have survived. I began wondering if it would be possible to get a replacement, or if I had lost all opportunity of tasting whiskey from my IWS founder glass.<br />With a heavy heart I opened my bag. Not only was the glass perfectly intact, even though my pen had broken, but when I raised it close to look for cracks, I caught a faint hint of sherry spice and vanilla.<br />Even in my joy, this struck me as odd, since I didn't use my glass at all last night during the tasting. But clearly someone has tried a dram from this glass. Either that, or in addition to being magical, the glass is also haunted by the trace of what smells like a sherried Speyside.<br />I'm going to lash a Lagavulin into it now to see if I can exorcise the ghosts of whiskey past.<br />Cheers, everyone.</div>

				<div class="content">Nice story JC.  Glencairns are pretty tough and hard to break, but I don't have any that smell of whisky on their own.  Spooky!</div>

				<div class="content">I have a suspicion that someone might have given my glass a trial run, just to be sure it held whiskey well or something.<br />It's holding Brogan's, a bourbon finished Bushmills, at the moment. But until I thoroughly washed it, I swear it smelled strongly of a sherried oaky spirit.<br />I even handed it to the better half, and she smelt it too. (Good nose, she has too.)</div>

				<div class="content">LOL!<br />The other half suggested that too. But I was tucked up in bed, as I reminded her!<br />I was more than satiated by the tremendous drams we had last night, and didn't tipple when I got home.<br />Nope, whatever my glass smelt of predated my ownership, I'm pretty sure.</div>

				<div class="content">I intend to do just that tonight. Although, when I washed it earlier, the smell vanished. And with a Lagavulin in it, it smelt pretty comprehensively of peat and the ocean as you'd expect. And right now, it smells of, well, a bourbon finished Bushmills.<br />But we'll see if there's any scent left after a good dousing in the old fairy liquid.<br />I'll be honest with you, if it smells of a sherried Speyside again tomorrow morning, I may sleep somewhere else tomorrow night!</div>

				<div class="content">They say the sleep of reason produces monsters. <br />I've tended to find that the sleep induced by Scotch produces exactly the opposite effect.<br />It should be available on prescription on the NHS. Probably more organic and better for you than many of those ghastly pills doctors are always prescribing.</div>
