				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>John wrote:</cite>I see the new site design is being rolled out - when will the forum itself be converted?</div></blockquote><br />It does have a new look but the main immediate aims are to get more content up and to support direct editing by other interested members. Already you can see that there is far more detail on past events, for example. In the immediate future I want to get pages for Links (what's there is just a placeholder), Bibliography, Tasting Notes and Society Bottlings. Longer term is everything else related to Irish whiskey <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The forum is different software on a different server so it needs some special attention to make it look like the rest of the site but I'll be having a go in the next few days.</div>

				<div class="content">The designer's opportunity is spared in light of the fact that many lines of code can be embedded with a solitary key stroke bolster for all PHP ventures. Editors are a financially savvy method for making web applications. A large portion of these editors, which empower an engineer to take a shot at PHP programming advancement, can be downloaded from the web. PHP offers more usefulness to a site than is accessible with HTML. Different elements that PHP offers are performing of figurings of numerous sorts, keeping up address books, cooperation with and simple production of databases. PHP is versatile and can be utilized by numerous social database administration frameworks, working frameworks and stages, and sent on most web servers. With the quantity of exceptional components accessible, PHP programming improvement devices offer a designer a surprising level of adaptability.<br />Thanks&amp; regards,<br />Angel anave<br /><a href="http://www.tricewebdevelopment.com/" class="postlink">Toronto Web Development</a> | <a href="http://www.tricewebdevelopment.com/" class="postlink">Web Development Toronto</a></div>
