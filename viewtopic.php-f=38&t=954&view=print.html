Hot dogs out of a tin and boiled. ( throwup smilie ). It's only a matter of time before their &quot;spay-on cheese&quot; crosses the water.<br /> <br />You can't not love Champ. I always mashed the spud and onions with milk only, and then served with a generous knob of melting butter on top, and the chopped green spring onion stems on top too. <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /> <br />( do the Irish really use the term scallions? )</div>

				<div class="content">As a true blue inner-city Dub I can pass on my coddle recipe. For the pot add spuds, water sausage and rashers plus two whole onions, peeled of course. Bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simir for an hour.This should be done the day before to enhance flavour. Thicken the coddle with some cornflower mixed in milk. This meal was often prepared on a Saturday night and served for breakfast on Sunday morning. It was very very useful for feeding large families, as was the norm in the fifties and sixties growing up. If you must serve mashed potatoes use warm milk to mash them, not cold. There is of course a hight salt and fat content in this meal so be careful. Try this with a glass of greenore 8 yrs old, to counteract the salt.Regards Liam Murray Kilkenny</div>
