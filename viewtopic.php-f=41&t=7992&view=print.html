				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />Drinkstore.ie had Batch 1 very recently so give them a shout. They may still have some. <br /><br />Cask Strength will prove alot harder. Looking for it myself and was asked for â‚¬400 recently for a bottle which I'm definitely not paying. <br /><br />The Super Valu release was gone off the shelves the minute it landed on them. You may still find one but you'll be doing very well.</div>

				<div class="content">The SuperValu release  was certainly not cheap when you consider what you are getting is a <br />4 year old whiskey in an ornate bottle for 78 Euro. When are we going to see an actual release from Dingle <br />which will be their flagship brand or is it all going to be 'super-premium' releases for a collector <br />type market rather than a drinking market.???</div>

Dingle do not have a  large production capability. From their own perspective, there are plusses and minuses. My local offie where I got issue 1 was not given any issue2.......they do not like Dingle as a result. There is a danger.....and Dingle must manage it.....that they will be seen as moneygrubbers  creating &quot;scarcities&quot;.<br /><br />Against this, Dingle did not buy in whiskey and pass it off as their own. It is a genuine new Irish whiskey.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_sunny.gif" alt=":sunny:" title="Sunny" /></div>

Cooley stock I believe!</div>

				<div class="content">I bought a Dingle 16 miniature in the Temple Bar shop two years ago.  Almost drank it on the plane on the way home, but had something else instead.  Now I'm glad I didn't!  Looks great in the collection next to the Batch 1.</div>
