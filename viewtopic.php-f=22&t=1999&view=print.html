				<div class="content">I recently visited dublin and picked up a bottle of Palace Bars 9 yr single malt.  Can't seem to find many reviews on this.  Had a taste at the bar but was a bit tipsy and don't recall much other than it seemed tasty and smooth.  Is this considered a good whiskey?  Any reviews and information on this drink would,be appreciated.  Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">It's bourbon-matured Cooley malt. I think most people agree it's pretty good around this age, and that it's possible to select some particularly fine single casks.<br /><br />I would recommend anyone to try The Palace whiskey, particularly since it's hard to get aged, unpeated, unfinished Cooley malt generally. Tyrconnell is young and their ten year-olds are finished in various woods.</div>
