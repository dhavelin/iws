				<div class="content">First post, be gentle with me <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Collecting</span><br />I've been hearing quite a bit about people collecting whiskey.<br />I find it hard not to indulge in a bottle when I know for a fact that it's delicious, but one day I'll summon the will power to just say no.<br />Either that or I will start buying in bulk.<br />With a view to that, what are the does and don't of collecting potentially valuable bottles?<br />How do you know if a bottle will be valuable later on?<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Batch/Year Identification</span><br />Take Yellow Spot for example. I've a few bottles of it.<br />Will the first few batches be worth more a few years down the road?<br />And what do the numbers L231531374 and L213231117 mean? Are they a clue to what batch/year/etc they are?<br />I've searched online for both codes and found nothing.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Ciaran.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ciaran,<br /><br />L2 is the year  i.e 2012<br /><br />132 &amp; 315 are the day, 11 May &amp; 11 Nov respectively,<br /><br />From a collectors point of view, it doesn't make a huge difference except in the odd case, <br />Open them try them side by side and which ever one is nicer is slightly more desirable, but not meaningfully so in terms of value,<br /><br />An exception is the 2005 Rebreast 15 batch which was superlative... with the 2011 batch (new packaging) the nearest to the original<br /><br />Regards TWB</div>
