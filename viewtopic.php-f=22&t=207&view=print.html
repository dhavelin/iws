				<div class="content">As a matter of interest have any of ye heard the documentary on Locke's Distillery, Kilbeggan?  It was part of an RTE series on 'fogotten' Irish industries.  There were a fair amount of interviews with people that remembered the distillery working and had worked in it, mixed in with excerpts from the current guided tour.  It's an interesting piece of oral history and history of perceptions to the distillery as well.<br /><br />For example there's a vocal piece from a lady (with a very proper accent, former secretary I think), who was very satisfied at the distillery's closure and glad that the husbands would now be at home sober with the wives.  That can be compared with the dismay evident from people connected with those that worked there, as there was no other work in the town at all and most had to emigrate.<br /><br />There are also several descriptions from people of how the whiskey was made etc., but beware, some of it is patently false!!  And describes how for example the wash was so strong it'd knock a man out or that the foreshots were poisonous and discharged into the river etc.....</div>
