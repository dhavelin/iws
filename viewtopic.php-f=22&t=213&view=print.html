				<div class="content">I don't think distilling is the crime so much as possession of illicit spirit or having it for sale.<br />So by that rationale, one could distill as much as one wants, so long as it's all thrown down the drain immediately afterwards.<br />Illicit Distillation Act 1831 and Intoxicating Liquor Act 1924 seem to be the relevant legislation.</div>
