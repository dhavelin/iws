				<div class="content">I like the buttery taste. I get hints of vanilla tobacco like pipe tobacco but very mild, similar to the Malaga component of Yellow Spot. The buttery taste I get is similar to almond toffee like a Diam bar. I got an early taste so wasn't expecting the Sherry Monster. That would be an unusual experience indeed. I was lucky to taste some whiskey matured in Sherry casks last week and they could launch some monsters if they wanted.</div>

				<div class="content">Here are some of my tasting notes on this new release.<br /><br />Nose: Rich, sweet, dark fruit; certainly more spicy than you would expect.<br /><br />Palate: Smooth, sweet, oily &amp; spicy (All good so far as SPS goes!) The mouthfeel is excellent, the 'Christmas Cake' complexity is there, though it does feel that the cake has certainly taken on a new dimension.<br /><br />Finish: Long, lingering, excellent; the sherry maturation gradually loses influence to the central character of the familiar Redbreast SPS.<br /><br />Impression: I really like it! This is relatively new territory for sure and from conversations I've had over the past two weeks, it has divided opinions. Those opinions continue to be offered though - which is great! It means that members are still exploring and analysing and spending the time appreciating it; rather than just giving an off-the-cuff assessment. I hope this is the first of many sherry-matured expressions; including perhaps PX even(?!). However, as a member of the IWS and having had the opportunity to taste some of the cask-strength sherry-matured SPS, I would love to see Midleton release such a version!</div>

				<div class="content">Completely agree GWH! <br />The RB15yo will continue to play a part in the range for a good while yet. I'm surprised if the Mano a Lámh is still available, but if it is then I'd pickup a bottle or two of that. I really like it so I might be slightly biased in that regard but there you go!<br />Enjoy!<br />J.</div>

				<div class="content">there was a very mixed reaction after the release to be just kind....<br /><br />but there was more of a dislike about it, and that is my opinion too, so i guess that is why they still had some i would guess, <br /><br />or as we know from previous releases from same company, when they found &quot;an&quot; old cask they made 1200+ bottles out of it <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so that 2000 maybe 3000?<br /><br />i stashed a good few anyways, just to be sure, it may worth money at some stage <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /> and just presented one to a friend</div>

				<div class="content">They're doing well at auctions in the UK. The £250 a couple of months ago was mad but another got £110 last week. <br /><br />I like the whiskey. It's not your standard Redbreast by any means. It has more in common with 50/60's Redbreasts. <br /><br />I think IDL are slow at selling Premium whiskey and limited editions. The 20 anniversary &amp; Master Dustillers took years to sell. The Dungourney has only gone off the sales books. That's 20 years to sell out. It's reputed that one man bought most of them. <br /><br />The Mano A Lámh is moving at a reasonable rate if you consider that only Irish Whiskey Collectors and enthusiasts would be buying them. It's also limited to the EU. If it was open to the U.S. too it may move quicker.</div>
