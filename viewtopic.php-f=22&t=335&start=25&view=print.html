				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>IrishWhiskeyChaser wrote:</cite>I think I'll be leaving this one on the shelf ... Basically a £100 for what was probably a bog standard blend of the time. I was thinking that 50 quid would be expensive for it and as usual the wooden box adds greatly to the price tag. But I do have to agree I do like the look of it ... <br /><br />Baaaa hum bug ...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />A nice cool £5 mill to be bled from whiskey enthusiasts and yes I'm being very cynical on this one but not surprised.</div></blockquote><br /><br />...but £5 of the £100 price is going to charity!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />   If you think that price is bad (apprx Can$160), the LCBO here in Ontario had a small quantity of it for (I believe) around Can$250!!</div>
