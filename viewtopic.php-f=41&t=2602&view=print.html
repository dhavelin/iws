				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />I'm looking for some help identifying the age of an old bottle of Jameson I found in my dad's collection. <br />It looks real old but I don't know how old it is... If anybody could even ball park the year range, I'd really appreciate it. I could t upload the pic on the site but here's a link : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/ZunmAaW">http://imgur.com/ZunmAaW</a><!-- m --> <a href="http://imgur.com/ZunmAaW" class="postlink">http://imgur.com/ZunmAaW</a><br /><br />Thank you!!!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Vjmuses, <br /><br />Although the label possibly makes you think it is really old it is not overly in whiskey collecting terms.<br /><br />This I believe was the first incarnation of the 12yo Blend and dates from the mid 80's to the 90's.<br /><br />However in saying that it is worth more than a standard 12yo you can buy today.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure but guessing â‚¬80-120 in value but I'm sure one of the other lads will have a better estimate if that is not quite correct.<br /><br />It is a bit different from the current 12yo offering and in a good way. Would be well worth it to someone who really enjoys Jameson or Irish whiskey to have this to drink.</div>

				<div class="content">I think that's about right, price-wise. It's generally a lovely one to drink. Quite rich sherry, usually.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with that too. There's still plenty of them around. Very nice whiskey. <br /><br />There's a couple coming up on auction next week and I'll have a look at the results.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the inputs ... I wasn't actually hoping for info With intention of me monetising the  value, but more so coz I was hoping it might give the story of my finding it more gravity. I was born in 81, so, considering what I've heard so far, it isn't too much of a fetch to say the bottle is as old as I am .... Lol :p<br /><br />I appreciate the info and anything more you can help with would be great!! <br /><br />I'm in india, and I love my whiskey. The coincidence is that I've switched to whiskey for only 3 years and just happened to have tried Jameson when I was making the switch ( hadn't heard about it before that). And then to find this bottle lying around? Pretty cool.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, an excellent find congratulations. And I think if you hold on to it and keep it as a bottle to drink for yourself it will be a very enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Not sure on the availability of the various Jameson in your part of the world but you certainly should get a regular Jameson to taste this against. And if you can a current Jameson 12yo which in itself is a nice whiskey but i think you will find a different twist on the old one. As JohnM says a bigger sherry influence.<br /><br />Unfortunately I think these may be pre bottle code so if yours has a bottle code it will more than likely be a later bottling if they ever had it??? The WhiskeyBro, another member on this forum, did a lot of research on dates in regards to the IDL bottlings and he believes this came to Market in 1984 replacing the much plainer brown labeled version (Gold Writing) which was possibly a pure pot still but I can't quite remember</div>
