				<div class="content">&quot;All must have prizes!&quot;<br /><br />Incidentally, the Best Irish Whiskey according to this competition is Bushmills 1608. You could make a good argument for Bushmills having the best range of Irish whiskey but 1608 is nowhere close to being the best Irish whiskey, even compared to the others in the competition.</div>

It is probably in the Irish single Malt 13-17yo category. Of which Bushmills 16yo could well have been the only entry. <br /><br />I think the 1608 gets alot of fans due to the noteable extra dimention that the 46% strength adds over it's stable mates which are only 40%.</div>

				<div class="content">The entry system is a bit hit and miss.<br /><br />I don't think IDL enter these competitions at all but importers can enter them. So on this basis you may never have a full compliment of Irish whiskies also the Irish WHiskey industry in general is not great at representing itself to these competitions as the have a habit of only going with what is their main stay whiskies as opposed to entering single cask versions too. I can see why they wouldn't but it might raise the exposure of Irish Whiskey excellence if they did.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm very aware of the flaws of such competitions.<br />But the SF competition is pretty well run and very comprehensive in its coverage of all spirits. That's why I was surprised at the Redbreast SNAFU previously.<br />I think these results are reasonable and concur with some of my own tasting conclusions: I too have found Jameson RVR totally overrated, and Paddy and Slane both underrated generally.<br />We all have our own pantheon of course, but I think their choice of double gold winners is a good guide to what's best in Irish whiskey. And I certainly wouldn't disagree with them stating that they found all of Bushmills' output to be top notch.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes Jim I would agree with you it is certainly one of the better competitions. And yes Paddy is not the gut rot that some people think it is.<br /><br />Just to explain to others<br /><br />A list of Medal can be meaningless unless put into context as there is a bit more to it than just the Gold medal.<br /><br />They used to have them all listed in their categories before and it was a bit clearer as to what was getting a gold medal for what. You can be sure Paddy was not in the same category as Jameson RVR. So just because all have gold medals does not mean they are being measured against each other.<br /><br />This is something people get confused about with Jim Murray too when he gives an Ardbeg 97points and Jameson nas 97 points. He does not measure them against each other but measures them in categories. The ardbeg is the best in one class and the Jameson is the best in another class. I don't agree with him on either but I know where he is comming from.</div>

				<div class="content">I think we're lucky to have three great distilleries in Ireland. Personally, Midleton would be my favourite, but that's not to say it's the best - it's hard to judge as they all produce such different stuff. Bushmills doesn't suit my tastes quite as much as Midleton or Cooley, although they have some nice stuff for sure. <br /><br />Last year in the same competition Bushmills 1608 only got bronze. <br /><br />I like this competition, as the spirits are tasted blind (I think). I'm not sure if they separate premium whiskey from standard whiskey in the tastings, but couldn't be sure. I think they may just taste Irish blends together, Irish malts together, etc. <br /><br />It would be interesting to see what people's favourite Irish distillery is, though. Maybe a poll?</div>

So as you can see you may only have Jameson 12yo &amp; Powers 12yo in the 10-12yo category. It is the same for Single malts. There are some many categories that it make it very hard for a distillery not to have a few wins.<br /><br />But the reason Irish whiskey wins all these golds is because the quality is high in the first place and there are plenty of categories to thin out the competition.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>JohnM wrote:</cite>If they do categorise them like that, then Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve is in the same category as Paddy.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Not neccessairly I think there is a premium category and possibly a super premium category too but whether that goes with the Irish Whiskey section but I wouold imagine Midleton VR &amp; Jameson RVR would be in a category of their own along with possibly Kilbeggan 15yo. SO basically a category of 3.<br /><br />I remember they had all the categories listed a few yaers ago and there were maximum a handful of Irish whiskies in any one category. Possibly not listing the categories and they may have changed it all around as I honestly don't know if they've changed the criteria or not.<br /><br />However all the winners of each category goes up against each other to find an over all winner which is the Bushmills 1608 which is probably the best accolade of them all. This will obviously devide people  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">You're right - I should have read more carefully. <br /><br />I can't see anywhere on the website about tasting categories, apart from the award categories. I think they should publish this.<br /><br />I think they taste them blind, which means there can be no arguing with the result. But it just shows how variable tastings are when 1608 wins a bronze one year and a double gold the next. <br /><br />I'd love to see more stuff from Bushmills - more older whiskeys. The Millennium 1975 was great, or the ones I've had, apart maybe from one.</div>

				<div class="content">I think everyone would love to see more older Bush.<br />Although, given the price point of the 21 yo, I'd be fearful of what they might charge for say a 25 yo or 30 yo.<br />With the expanded capacity, I hope that they are laying down more casks for the long haul. <br />Even if they lack the stocks for a regular bottling, I think there would be a lot of interest in an older single cask Bush.</div>
