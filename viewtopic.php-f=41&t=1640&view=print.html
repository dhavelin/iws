I reckon that this is a 12 year old with that label missing.<br /><br />I have seen quite a few of that exact main label type too but would not be surprised if there was a few with out the 12yo statement full stop.</div>

The only other one's similar were all 12 year old as you said, but there would not be enough room for that label on that hexagonal bottle.<br />It also say's Pure old Pot Still on the label but the 12 was referred to as extra Liqueur special from what I can find. <br /><br />Any way it's gone out of my price range now. I've 3 different hexagonal bottle at this stage and another would ruin the symmetry of my drinks cabinet. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>

				<div class="content">I've been looking around to try to help find one, but alas no luck thus far outside of what's been covered here already.  It has brought up a question for me though.  The old 7yrs from what I've seen come in green, brown, and clear bottles that are of similar size and shape.  What differentiates these?  Is it age, bottler, geography, etc?  Or some other obvious reason I'm not thinking of at the moment?  Haven't been able to do much looking into it but thought I'd throw out the question here in case anyone had a quick answer.  Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">The hexagonal bottle is genuine I believe but is the regular 3 star and not the 12<br />year old. Probable reason is that they used this type of bottle in the German export<br />market at that time. The 12 year old is a very distinctive label.</div>

				<div class="content">On the combined topics of old 7yr Jamesons and iffy bottles, I came across this one from a recent bonham's auction:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19987/lot/162/" class="postlink">http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19987/lot/162/</a><br /><br />In my short experience in older bottles I've not seen the two labels so far apart on the bottle with such a space in between them.  Could this have been relabeled or were they made this way at one time?  The seal looks okay i think, and you'd expect it was vetted by bonham's at least.  Another rich price again, anyway.</div>
