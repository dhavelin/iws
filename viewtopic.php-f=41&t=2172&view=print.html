				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />Images would help, it sounds like an own label bottling by a publican, prior to the 1970s publicans often received Powers &amp; Jameson by the cask and bottled and labelled it themselves using labels supplied by the distillery with the publicans details typed on the label.</div>

		</div><br />These are photos of the bottles Pye mentioned.<br /><br />The labels are from a bonder. The capsule looks similar to ones used by IDL in the 70's. They seem an odd combination. I thought the label was much older.<br /><br />Do you know the history of the bottle?</div>

				<div class="content">Millars of Thomas St. only finally closed in the early 80's as far as I know.<br />They used to bottle it as Millar's Black Label at one time. The label has been <br />re-incarnated as Millar's Special Reserve --- used the Black Label term on the <br />early re-incarnated bottles but had to change due to a threat from a Scottish <br />Distiller that makes another well known 'Black Label' . Like all bonders they would <br />have got casks of 10 year old and bottled it themselves prior to their supply being <br />cut off in the late 60's early 70's. The original Millar's Black Label blend continued <br />till the early 80's. Bottle most likely from last period (Late 60's/early 70's)</div>
