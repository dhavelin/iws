				<div class="content">Hello,<br />High alcohol content, as in whiskey, acts as a natural barrier to spoilage by micro-organisms. However this does not always mean that the whiskey will taste good. <br /><br />If there has been evaporation from the bottle, then the flavour of the whiskey has more than likely been compromised. Excess oxygen reacts with the ethanol to produce other compounds (e.g. Acetaldehyde) that in excess do not taste good. Some of the lighter fruity/floral esters will also tend to evaporate from the liquid over long periods of time.  <br /><br />If the cap/seal has stood the test of time, then the whiskey should taste as good as the day it was bottled. One exception is the possibility of taints from the cork if the whiskey has been stored for a long time on its side. The correct storage for spirits is standing upright.<br /><br />Although the level could ideally be higher in the neck of the bottle, I have to say that your whiskey looks in decent condition. Hope this info is of some help to you.<br /><br />Please do PM me if you are interested in selling your whiskey. I am a collector of old Irish Whiskeys and would love go add this bottle to my collection.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Eric</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the pics, looks great (for it's age) and yes you have a nice little treasure on your hands.<br /><br />It is probably worth a few quid and I would not be selling it from less than â‚¬1000 but if you were to sell it I think you should think of Auction.<br /><br />And yes you can date it quite easily by the Appointment to his Majesty King George V which is 1910 to 1936, which is not a bad band of time to be dating such an old bottle. <br />So your 1928 is perfectly reasonable but I don't think it matters whether it is from 1910 or 1936 either as it will not affect the value.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing and best of luck no matter what you do with it.<br /><br />Let us know how you get on.</div>
