				<div class="content">It is a nicely stocked cabinet!  My wife just shakes her head but cant say too much since it was her father who started me down the path.  I will have to pick up some bottles for some St. Pats tasting.  The Red Breast 15 is next on my list; I have never seen the Powers Johns Lane.  Our liquor sales used to be State run, but this year it became privatized.  Prices shot up due to punitive taxation by the State, and I have found selection to be no better at this point.  I hope that changes and things open up a bit.<br />I have had several of the Aberlour's but A'bunadh is my favorite, and I dont think anyone I have steered that way has been disapointed.  I had no experience with Peat, and picked up a bottle of McCarthys Oregon Whiskey, which I understand is made to be like an Islay type Scotch and very heavily peated...  A little brash of an introduction for me.  I went to a Whiskey tasting at a nearby restaurant and the presenter had some peat that he lit and let smoke... then we tried some lightly peated Scotch and I could appreciate it a bit more.  My Whiskey exploration has a long way to go and I am enjoying it one sip at a time!  <br />I will keep my eye out for that Powers as well, thanks for the suggestion.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello all. I am a 42 year old Pub owner in Canada. The Toad in the Hole Pub.I've been here 8 years but the pub has been here for 22. I recently expanded, built another bar and we call it The Whiskey Bar. <br /><br />We have been open 8 months and currently offer over 160 Canadian, Irish, American and Scotish Whiskies.<br /><br />Personally, I don't like Scotch, I prefer Canadian, Irish and American and in that order.<br />My brother is a bartender and with my other bartender, are growing a vast knowledge in the product we serve and while I don't bartend anymore, I have taken it upon myself to become the &quot;go to&quot; guy when it pertains to Irish and Canadian Whiskies.<br />It has been a lot of fun and I have a long way to go.<br /><br />My bartender laughs at me because he say I am secretly doing some sneaky learning and he's right. This guy is an encyclopedia when it comes to all of my whiskey, especially scoth and I want to blow him away with the Irish knowledge.<br /><br />I have browsed a bit of this forum and will continue to do so, but can anyone tell me if there is the best or top 3 books available on the subject?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Nomad</div>

I know Amazon has a good selection of books on the subject. <br />I recently read Ian Buxton &quot;101 whiskeys to try before you die&quot;. I wouldn't agree with his selection but it makes you think about your own selection.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Nomad!<br /><br />I thought Michael Jackson's &quot;Whiskey - Definitive World Guide&quot; was quite good but all the books that cover Irish whiskey are quite out of date now. So much has happened in the last few years.<br /><br />The best I can suggest is just to keep an eye on what happens from here (on this forum, or if there was a handy blog, say, that covered such things  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) and you'll get the picture. The industry is small enough that it doesn't take too long to get a handle on it.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Nomad,<br /><br />Books are really subjective and as David above said anything written to date is woefully out of date but a couple to get you grounded I think would be a worth while read ...<br /><br />Classic Irish Whiskey : Jim Murray  or Jim Murray's Irish Whiskey Almanac : Jim Murray (Both very similar so go for which ever it the longest  as that will have slightly more information.<br /><br />The Whiskeys of Ireland : Peter Mulryan is a very easy to read book and is a great one stop introduction to Irish whiskey.<br /><br />Both cover the old faithful s but as David has said the Irish Whiskey landscape has changed immensely in the last 3 years. <br /><br />So once upto date with those you can then update yourself by going through forums like our own and reviews etc from John Hansel and the multitude of other sources.<br /><br />We have a list of books here on Irish whiskey in the main just as a resource list.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/reference/bibliography">http://www.irishwhiskeysociety.com/refe ... bliography</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Any questions feel free to ask and I'm sure someone will try and put you straight  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumright.gif" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up" /> <br /><br />Enjoy the learning curve</div>

				<div class="content">Hello to all. I am a 62 year old semi retired project manager, currently living in Robin Hood country near Nottingham. Distilled and matured in Scotland near Glasgow for 24 years before going off to the wide world. My first taste of whisky was of course scotch (most likely Bells), at 14 years old on a youth club outing. Didin't end well for a few of us...<br /><br />Father had a tradition of pouring a glass for all the males in the house before setting off to weddings, funerals and christenings, and any other event worthy of note. I was eventually allowed into that exclusive circle and had my first glass in that circumstance at 16 years old before setting of to my older Sister's wedding. Probably around 9am, since we had to get up to Perthshire before 11.30am. I have of course maintained that tradition and have passed it on to my own son. <br /><br />In my time I have sampled all sorts of whiskies, bourbons, sour mash, rye as well as other spirits from and in many places across the world. Can't say I have a real favourite whisky since there are so many variations and in my case it tends to go with the mood of the moment, or the occasion. <br /><br />As a scot, committed to supporting the cause of scotch, I have absolutely no hesitation in offering equal support to the Irish Whiskey. Having previously had only the more usual and readily available Jamesons, Black Bush etc, I was introduced to the Midleton by my dear Brother In Law Neil, (sadly departed, RIP) who brought a bottle of the 1992 home from a trip to Ireland. What a revelation that was on my first taste, and I remain a staunch and devoted fan. Even now as I write, I have the empty bottle and wooden case in front of me, on my desk, recently returned to me for safekeeping from my Son who feared for its' safety when he moved to London. It has become something of a family treasure with associated stories of Neil's legendary and very eventful trip to Ireland.<br /><br />So there we are. A great fan of both the Scotch and Irish whiskies, and a grudging acceptance that other countries can make a passable attempt at imitation.</div>
