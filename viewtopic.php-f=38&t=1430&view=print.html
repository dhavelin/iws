				<div class="content">Hi there,<br /><br />I am flying to Ireland at the beginning of Feb 2012 for my 40th birthday.<br />I have rented a self-catering house in Killarney for a week. I know that Killarney is pretty much a &quot;Touri Place&quot;, but I think you can reach many nice places from there.<br /><br />I have just some questions about whiskey drinking in Killarney and this area:<br /><br />The Beaufort Bar is a place I found on irelandwhiskeytrail.com. They say this pub should have more than 100 different whiskies... Does somebody know this place?<br />Can anybody recommend another place in Killarney or not that far away?<br /><br />Thank you all!</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know much about whisky bars in Kerry, but the Sheen Falls Hotel in Kenmare has one - very, very expensive, though. <br /><br />Regardless of the whisky, I think it's worth visiting Kenmare. A lovely town.</div>

				<div class="content">I go down to Kerry a few times a year to visit my brother just outside Tralee. Lots to see alright,but good Whiskey bars are rare. I recommend you buy some good ones in the airport to have back in the house.<br />If you have time go to Banna beach,great for water sports.Its northwest of Tralee. <br />If your into your golf Ballybunnion is a little further up the road too.<br />Best wishes for the birthday and i hope you have a great time</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah. Very expensive. <br /><br />The one Whisky Base have is actually a Caperdonich. <br /><br />Older Strathislas and Longmorns from Gordon &amp; MacPhail are very good value and they're very good distilleries.</div>
