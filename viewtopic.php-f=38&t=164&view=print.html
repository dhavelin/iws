Feeling quite paranoid now. Only one thing for it. Redbreast 15. Maybe everyone else is just out for Friday night pints. I would normally be too but I've to travel tomorrow. Am I talking to myself now. This is not good. I suppose as long as I don't answer myself that's fine.<br /><br />That's correct IainB. All is well.
